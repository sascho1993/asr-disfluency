The scripts and files in this directory can be used to analyse the distribution of OOVs in the dialogAct Switchboard corpus.
Words are makred as OOV if they do not occur in the Komninos embeddings.
The script count_one_word_rep.py can be used to find all one-word-repetitions (e.g. [ the + the ]) and all disfluencies contained in total.
Both one-wprd-repetitions and OOVs can be used as 'stupid baselines' for disfluency detection systems.
