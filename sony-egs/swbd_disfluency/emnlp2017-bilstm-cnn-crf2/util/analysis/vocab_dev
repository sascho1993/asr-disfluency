do
you
know
anyone
that
uh
is
is
in
a
nursing
home
or
has
ever
been
in
one

uh-huh

well
i
'm
trying
to
think

my
uh
uh
wife
's
grandmother
had
alzheimer
's

and
they
were
going
to
put
her
into
a
a
nursing
home

and
uh
they
when
they
put
her
in
she
had
all
kinds
of
trouble

and
the
nursing
home
made
them
come
and
take
her
back
because
she
was
being
a
a
you
know
a
a
nuisance
or
worse
than
a
nuisance

i
mean
she
sort
of
went
you
know
bananas

and
they
could
n't
could
n't
deal
with
her

so
i
guess
you
need
to
uh
know
whether
it
's
a
you
know
a
no
deposit
no
return
kind
of
thing
whether

yeah

right

right

my
grandmother
actually
was
in
a
a
nursing
home
that
uh

there
was
a
retirement
hotel
and
then
a
uh

there
was
some
sort
of
full-time
care
place
that
was
also
associated
with
it

so
for
uh
the
first
few
years
she
had
her
own
apartment
and
you
know
made
her
own
meals
sometimes
but
could
could
also
go
and
eat
someplace
else

and
then
uh
as
she
became
less
able
to
take
care
of
herself
then
she
moved
into
this
other
part
that
was
able
to
uh
provide
full-time
care

and
uh
she
did
n't
have
to
do
anything
anymore

but
my
experience
has
been
that
most
people
that
move
into
nursing
homes
die
very
quickly

and
that
's
som-

i
do
n't
know
whether
that
's
because
they
you
know
sort
of
give
up
hope
once
they
get
in
there
or
what
the
the
reason
is

but
i
think
the
average
length
of
time
that
somebody
lives
in
a
nursing
home
is
only
like
six
months
or
something

yeah

right

yeah

if
if
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
at
all
or
have
someone
that
can
take
care
of
you
then
you
stay
where
you
are

then
you
only
go
there
as
a
last
resort

or
people
send
you
there
as
a
last
resort

uh-huh

right

right

yeah

i
guess

right

when
you
need
it
you
need
it
i
guess

right

yeah

sure

and
you
probably
if
it
were
you
you
probably
would
n't
want
someone
choosing
a
place
for
you
to
live
based
on
lowest
price

yeah

well
maybe
that
's
the
purpose
of
the
nursing
home
is
to
have
them
go
someplace
where
they
can
see
that
it
's
not
worth
continuing

yeah

right

yeah

i
've
known
quite
a
few
people
that
have
uh
gone
to
retirement
communities

i
do
n't
know
if
they
have
them
back
there

but
here
in
california
and
in
ari-

no

but
i
my
grandparents
were
looking
into
it
before

so
i
know
what
they
've
said

uh-huh

oh
they
thought
it
was
too
much
of
a
bother

right

if
they
're
equipped
too
to
handle
the
kind
of
patients
you
're
going
to
have
you
know
put
in
there
too

because
i
know
my
grandparents
wanted
to
have
some
independence
still

they
wanted
some
place
they
can
go
and
have
their
meals
and
a
nurse
on
staff
just
in
case
they
needed
her

but
they
wanted
to
be
independent
as
well
have
their
own
room

uh-huh

well
a
lot
of
it
's
probably
to
do
with
the
fact
that
people
go
to
it
because
they
need
help

they
need
health
care

so
they
're
already
ill
before
they
go

that
's
probably
a
large
factor

uh-huh

right

right

that
's
what
my
grandparents

it
was
just
so
that
the
rest
of
the
relatives
would
have
peace
of
mind
knowing
that
if
anything
happened
there
was
somebody
there
for
them

so
that
was
their
thinking

somebody
who
would
know
what
to
do
in
the
event
of
an
emergency

and
also
so
they
could
find
someplace
that
they
enjoyed
while
they
still
had
choices
to
make
so
they
would
n't
be
stuck
going
into
just
whatever
nursing
home
was
available
at
the
time

i
guess
that
's
a
problem
too
for
people
wait
lists
and
all

that
uh

you
ca
n't
always
get
in
when
you
want
too

and
of
course
you
ca
n't
just
sit
around
and
wait

yeah

and
the
money
is
also
another
issue
how
you
're
going
to
pay
for
it

at
that
stage
of
life
you
only
have
so
much
money
left

and
i
guess
it
's
not
exactly
fair
for
the
younger
family
members
to
have
to
put
it
in
their
savings

i
mean
it
is
kind
of
fair

but
it
's
also
not
fair
because
they
have
their
own
children
to
raise

so
it
's
another
problem

right

right

so
it
it
's
just
so
complicated
anymore
i
think

people
outlive
their
savings

and
with
medicine
being
the
way
it
is
you
're
extending
life
where
sometimes
the
quality
of
living
has
gone
down

and
they
're
not
necessarily
enjoying
life
anymore

it
's
just
a
shame
that
's
the
way
it
has
to
be

i
think
the
retirement
home
idea
's
a
nice
idea
to
go
and
find
older
people
and
with
similar
interests
and
someplace
to
stay

and
cause
like
if
your
spouse
died
all
alone
it
'd
be
nice
to
go
someplace
with
people
similar
to
you
to
have
friends

okay

i
see

a
a
good
a
good
southern
solution

uh-huh

you
'd
have
to
say
that

uh
i
do
n't
know

the
the
things
they
asked
to
talk
about
were
whether
the
uh
whether
the
judge
should
be
the
one
that
does
the
uh
sentencing

and
seems
to
me
that
that
's
i
think
that
's
the
way
it
's
done
now

uh
at
least
my
understanding
of
the
law
which
is
n't
very
good

uh
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judge
does
it

and
i
i
think
that
's
probably
all
right
in
that
they
you
know
maybe
know
what
the
the
norm
is
for
a
particular
thing

right

uh-huh

that
's
right

and
i
think
that
may
i
that
may
be
an
exception
as
well

because
i
think
that

does
n't
the
jury
decide
on
the
death
penalty
rather
than
than
the
judge

yeah

yes

in
fact
they
're
going
to
execute
somebody
at
the
end
of
this
month

and
uh
there
's
a
big
uproar
going
on
right
now
uh

the
uh
governor
you
know
has
been
trying
to
decide
whether
he
's
going
to
commute
it
or
not

you
know
it
's
someone
who
had
uh
killed
two
teenage
boys
here
in
san
diego
as
a
matter
of
fact

yeah

uh-huh

something
inexpensive

yeah

i
think
this
particular
case
has
been
like
ten
or
fifteen
years

but
i
guess
there
have
been
several
cases
where
people
have
been
executed
by
mistake

and
you
'd
hate
to
be
one
of
those

the
other
thing
they
asked
about
was
whether
uh
uh
the
verdict
should
be
required
to
be
unanimous
which
again
i
think
is
the
way
it
is
now
that
all
the
all
verdicts

well
maybe
not

i
do
n't
know

at
least
in
capital
cases
i
'd
think
they
'd
have
to
be
unanimous

uh-huh

yeah

the
paper
here
tonight
had
a
thing
about
the
noriega
trial
and
that
there
's
one
juror
that
is
is
uh
different
than
the
other
eleven

and
uh
they
've
only
deliberated
four
hours
or
something

and
they
say
they
're
hopelessly
deadlocked

and
the
judge
told
them
they
were
n't
hopelessly
deadlocked
yet

yeah

six
months
so
far
they
said

so

maybe
they
could
go
with
a
with
a
nine
hundred
number
and
have
people
dial
in
and
give
their
uh
vote

right

oh
really

that
's
interesting

well
have
you
ever
served
on
a
jury

uh-huh

i
got
called

but
i
uh
never
uh
got
selected
for
a
jury

i
sat
for
tw-
ten
days
in
a
court
room
while
they
went
through
the
selection
process

and
they
had
some
guy
that
was
uh
defending
himself

i
say
they
uh

probably
the
best
things
to
do
is
is
tie
them
with
a
rope
and
throw
them
in
the
water

if
they
sink
they
're
innocent
right

yeah

uh
so
uh
how
do
you
how
do
you
feel

th-
that
's
of
course
being
facetious

but

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

and
i
guess
also
what
the
system
will
absorb

probably
more
tuned
in
to
that

possibly
though
on
uh
capital
cases
like
maybe
the
death
penalty

uh
i
'm
kind
of
undecided
on
that
whether
the
judge
should
have
the
sole

i
mean
he
could
have
like
a
personal
prejudice

you
know
judges
are
people
like
everybody
else
even
though
they
're
they
're
supposed
to
be
impartial

but
maybe
uh

i
i
think
that
's
i
think
that
's
the
way
it
is

uh
whether
they
they
decide
whether
or
not
they
uh
the
accused
or
whatever
would
get
the
uh
get
the
death
penalty

do
they
have
a
death
penalty
in
california

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

i

something
like
that
i
've
got
no
problem
with
it
uh

i
guess
the
way
i
think
about
it
is
not
it
should
n't
necessarily
be
thought
of
as
revenge

it
's
just
like
if
you
've
got
like
a
dog
that
's
running
wild
and
biting
people

put
it
to
sleep
you
know

just
get
it
out
you
know

it
's
not
able
to
fit
in
you
know

yeah

yeah

exactly

uh
i
guess
kind
of
the
way
i
think
about
it
also
is
they
just

if
somebody
gets
the
death
penalty
they
're
they
're
judged
guilty

they
got
the
death
penalty

they
should
have
one
year
and
one
appeal
cover
all
their
bases
with
one
appeal

and
if
not
you
know
do
n't
do
n't
let
them
sit
up
there
on
death
row
for
you
know
fifteen
years

uh-huh

yeah

that

yeah

oh
i
'm
sure

yeah

uh-huh

i
believe
it
is
in
capital

i
think
in
like
uh
lesser
cases
it
's
like
ten
out
of
twelve
or
five
out
of
six
whatever
how
ever
many
is
on
sitting
on
a
jury

i
t-
i
believe
that
's
the
way
it
is

but
i
'm
pretty
sure
you
're
correct
on
capital
cases
uh

uh-huh

yeah

oh
no

i
'm
telling
you
go
one
way
or
the
other

that
that
's
probably
an
expensive
trial
uh

yeah

probably

yeah

probably

you
know
i
'm
not
sure
there
's
a
number

it
's
probably
like
thirty
forty
thousand
dollars
a
day
you
know
worth
of
all
the
free
for
all

yeah

yeah

that
's
that
's
been
so
long
i
've
prac-
practically
forgot
who
noriega
was
you
know

that
has
been
going
on

my
uh
cousin
is
a
f
b
i
agent
down
in
miami

yeah

so
she
follows
that
stuff
pretty
closely

but
uh

yeah

she
's
not
involved
in
that
that
case

but
she
does

no

i
have
n't

i
never
have

my
wife
has

but
i
i
have
n't

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

that
's
right

that
's
right

you
know
what
what
uh
what
do
you
think
is
important

if
you
were

uh
i
do
n't
know
how
how
old
you
are

but
if
you
had
if
you
had
uh
parents
say
or
or
or
th-
grandparents
whatever
it
is
uh
who
were
ready
who
who
you
thought
might
benefit
from
a
nursing
home
what
do
you
think
you
would
look
for

huh

yeah

yeah

huh

well
my
uh
uh
my
wife
's
grandmother
is
in
a
nursing
home
in
uh
minnesota

and
we
go
there
uh
once
a
year

we
see
we
tend
to
see
her
there
cause
we
're
in
boston

so
we
're
pretty
far
away

when
we
visit
minnesota
though
we
go
to
see
her

and
it
seems
uh

i
mean
the
the
environment
there
i
do
n't
know
too
much
about
it

but
it
it
seems
nice
enough

uh
it
it
's
hard

at
least
half
of
the
residents
i
would
say
are
not
not
mentally
sound

so
it
's
hard
to
tell
how
much
of
that
rubs
off
on
those
who
are
struggling
to
r-
to
retain
uh
clarity
say
uh
you
know

yeah

well
i
i
don-
i
do
n't
know

we
we
also
my
wife
and
i
uh
uh
volunteer
to
go
to
a
uh
nursing
home
that
's
just
a
mile
from
our
house

we
uh
she
goes
more
often
than
i

we
used
to
go
once
a
month
once
every
two
months
to
visit
some
of
the
patients
there

and
we
'd
take
we
have
a
two
year
old
son

and
so
we
sometimes
we
'd
take
him
with
us

and
uh
there
i
would
say
it
's
the
same
thing

it
's
it
's
a
nice
uh
relatively
nice
environment

but
again
um
it
must
be
depressing
for
the
people
who
who
are
who
are
just
e-
e-
essentially
not
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
in
their
own
house
but
but
certainly
uh
certainly
have
ar-
ar-
are
have
retained
all
of
their
uh
mental
skills
and
so
on

it
's
must
be
depressing
to
to
walk
walk
the
halls
and
see
an-
and
see
all
these
other
people
who
really
do
n't
know
where
they
are

i
think
yeah

i
think
they
're
relatively
re-
respectful
yeah
and
and
concerned
that
in
as
much
as
they
can
be

i
i
think
sometimes
you
know
i
've
noticed
uh
people
asking
for
uh
some
of
the
patients
asking
for
things
uh
just
repetitively
and
but
things
that
are
not
reasonable

and
so
at
some
level
the
the
the
uh

i
'm
sure
that
the
that
the
uh
the
staff
l-
learn
what
's
normal
for
this
person

and
so
it
looks
to
me
like
maybe
their
not
catering
to
this
person
's
needs
is
really
because
this
person
is
just
you
know
is
just
in
a
state
where
they
do
n't
really
need
what
they
think
they
need
you
know

oh
yeah

yeah

i
'll
tell
you
one
thing
though
that
'll
that
that
i
i
saw
that
was
really
nice

we
saw
a
husband
and
wife

we
used
to
see
a
husband
and
wife
in
there
uh
together

and
they
were
in
the
same
room
which
not
all
husband
and
wives
were

but
these
two
were

and
when
you
walked
into
their
room
they
had
brought
all
their
furniture
from
their
house

and
so

yeah

you
walked
in
there

and
it
did
n't
look
like
uh
you
know
how
yo-
you
you
walk
into
some
rooms

and
there
's
it
's
completely
generic

there
's
nothing
maybe
a
picture
or
two
that
belongs
to
that
person

and
that
's
it

but
this
room
on
the
other
hand
you
know
they
got
rid
of
all
of
the
sort
of
standard
issue
beds
and
dressers
and
this
and
that

and
they
had
all
their
stuff
from
their
house

and
it
looked
like
uh
i-
i-
it
must
have
been

it
was
nicer
to
walk
in
there
and
to
talk
to
them

and
it
must
also
give
them
a
sense
of
uh
uh
security
and
and
uh
and
and
you
know
s-
s-
uh

yeah

huh

yeah

huh

temporary

i

that
that
's
that
's
new
to
me

i

right

right

bye

so
we
're
uh
our
discussion
's
about
uh
the
care
of
the
elderly

uh
well
i
actually
my
dad
's
my
dad
's
almost
ninety

and
he
lives
by
himself

and
he
's
in
good
shape

uh
but
uh
some
friends
of
mine
have
uh
gone
through
this

i
think
i
'd
look
for
a
home
where
they
got
a
lot
of
attention
and
uh
where
they
did
some
things
to
try
to
keep
them
um
mentally
alive
and
where
there
was
uh
caring
and
compassionate
where
there
were
caring
and
compassionate
people
uh
operating
it

do
you
have
any
experience
with
this
yourself

uh-huh

uh-huh

from
the
lack
of
stimulation
you
mean

do
you
think
that
in
the
case
of
the
one
that
you
've
actually
had
some
experience
with
that
the
people
who
operate
it
seem
to
have
what
you
'd
perceive
of
as
genuine
concern

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

it
it
's
possible

i
was
thinking
also
that
there
'd
be
there
could
be
a
fair
burn
out
factor
um
in
just
having
to
respond
to
people
's
needs
where
the
needs
are
sometimes
depending
on
the
person
not
going
to
be
what
we
would
perceive
of
as
rational
need

uh-huh

uh-huh

so
it
gives
them
a
sense
of
identity

yeah

i
i
think
part
of
what
you
're
saying
matches
what
i
h-
have
read

i
used
to
initially
think
that
the
only
people
who
went
into
such
residences
were
people
who
uh
were
adequately
deficient
in
their
abilities
uh
physical
or
mental
that
they
could
n't
take
care
of
themselves

but
i
also
know
a
couple
of
people
whose
parents
have
gone
into
such
things
because
i
think
they
provide
um
a
lot
of
social
activities

uh
the
one
of
my
friend
's
parents
who
went
in
because
she
had
largely
lost
her
abilities

and
she
was
in
there
for
awhile
when
they
were
away
on
vacation

uh
and

well
i
think
it
i
think
t-
it
was
sort
of
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
considering
whether
she
would
live
there

and
i
feel
like
the
whole
vocabulary
of
this
is
very
loaded
if
you
think
of
words
like
like
put
her
in
there

and
there
there
's
so
much

okay

uh
so
your
you
i
guess
you
're
probably
in
the
same
uh
same
situation
uh
we
're
in

we
're
kind
of
past
having
to
provide
child
care

our
our
kids
are
grown
up

we
do
n't
have
any
grandchildren
yet

but
uh
uh
they
're

uh
one
's
twenty-six

and
the
other
is
uh
twenty
twenty-one

so
they
're
uh
uh
they
're
they
're
getting
there

you
know
there
's
no
no
no
prospects
right
away
for
anything
to
happen

but
uh

uh-huh

oh

uh-huh

oh
okay

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

it
's
hard

we

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

huh

yeah

what
did
you
do
when
your
kids
were
growing
up

were
you

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

he
got
sick

yeah

right

well

guess
so

yeah

huh

right

yeah

a
little
more
flexibility

you
can
come
and
go

yeah

when
when
our
kids
were
small
we
had
a
couple
of
uh
good
good
women
who
uh
would
often
c-
uh
get
them
to
come
to
the
house

uh-huh

how
old
are
your
children

uh-huh

well
they
're
going
to
be
getting
there

yeah

u-
uh-huh

oh
i
see

i
have
uh
five
children

i
have
a
eighteen
year
old
son

the
rest
of
my
girls
are
like
twenty-three
twenty-six
twenty-eight
and
twenty-nine

and
i
have
three
granddaughters
right
now

and
uh
i
uh

one
's
in
iowa

and
uh
she
's
she
's
a
teacher

and
what
she
does
is
she
teaches
at
a
preschool

and
and
so
she
kind
of

and
they
let
her
bring
her
her
little
daughter
in
for
free

and
then
so

but
she
just
works
part-time

then
i
have
another
daughter
in
uh
bountiful
utah

and
she
has
to
work
full-time

and
it
's
just
tearing
her
apart

she
has
a
private
baby-sitter

and
uh
the
baby
just
screams

i
mean
the
baby
is
like
seventeen
months

and
she
just
screams

well
even
if
she
knows
that
they
're
fixing
to
get
ready
to
go
over
there

they
're
not
even
there
yet
you
know

and
and
then
i
have
my
uh
uh
i
have
a
seven
month
old
granddaughter

and
uh
her
mother
stays
home

and
she
they
live
they
live
with
us
you
know
in
as
orange
county
is
really
expensive

they
live
with
us

and
so
of
course
we
love
it
because
we
get
to
see
this
cute
little
baby
all
the
time

but
uh
uh
she
just

uh
she
used
to
work
in
pre
in
the
preschool
and
and
and
child
care

and
she
says
after
working
in
there

and
and
you
know
here
she
was
a
provider

but
you
know
there
's
only
so
much
one
person
can
do

she
said
it
's
so
awful

she
said
she
'll
never
put
her
child
in
a
in
a
in
a
preca-
in
a
p-
in
a
preschool

i
'm
sure
there
must
be
some
good
ones
around
here
somewhere

but
it
's
really
it
's
really
really
very
difficult

and

well
when
when

the
uh
the
first
uh
ten
years
see
first
ten
or
twelve
years
i
stayed
home

and
uh
then
after
that
i
i
went
to
work

and
uh
uh
uh
a
couple
of
times
i
just
uh
uh
you
know

th-
then
i
had
one
job

and
then
that
job
ran
out
because
it
was
kind
of
a
government
seeded
type
job

and
then
and
then
like
about
later
i
i
tried
to
get
the
baby
to
a
baby-sitter

supposed
to
be
good
uh
recommended
person
from
the
church

and
i
knew
her
personally

she
had
two
kids
of
her
own
and
everything

but
i
quit
my
job
because
i
could
n't
stand
how
she
was
taking
care
of
my
child

i
mean
first
of
all
uh
her
children
were
sick
all
the
time

so
when
my
son
stayed
over
there
he
got
sick

same
thing
same
thing
that
the
her
kids
had

right

and
so
uh
we
did
n't
take
her
over
there
until
like
about
eleven
o'clock

then
he
she
'd
take
my
son
and
her
daughter
over
t-
to
kindergarten

but
s-

that
day
uh
i
was
saying
now
he
he
's
sick

and
she
goes
well
she
goes
he
has
the
same
thing
that
all
my
kids
have

that
's
what
he
got
you
know

goes
well
okay

so
it
's
not
like
he
's
going
to
infect
her
kids

but
then
what
happened
was
is
i
said
uh
he
just
threw
up

and
kindergarten
starts
at
eleven
thirty

so
she
said
well
she
'll
keep
him
home

and
he
'll
probably
just
sleep
anyway

well
you
know
what

that
woman
sent
her
sent
him
to
kindergarten

she
sent
him
to
kindergarten

as
soon
as
he
went
there
the
teacher
took
one
look
at
him

and
he
threw
up
again

and
they
put
him
in
the
nursery
uh
they
put
him
in
the
nurse
's
office

and
then
what
happened
was
is
you
know
they
gave
her
a
call
because
they
knew
that
she
was
my
baby-sitter

called
her

and
they
said
uh
that
he
's
sick

well
she
was
n't
home

i
mean
her
all
her
kids
were
sick

but
she
was
n't
home
right

and
her
and
her
her
daughter
that
was
in
kindergarten
with
him
also
did
not
go
to
school
because
she
was
sick

now
why
did
n't
he
why
did
n't
she
keep
him
home
with
her

no

she
did
n't
do
that

so
it
got
to
the
point
where
he
's
he
's
supposed
to
get
out
of
uh
kindergarten
like
about
two
thirty

and
i
had
to
leave
work

it
was
it
was
five
o'clock
in
the
evening

and
i
found
out
he
was
still
there
at
school

and
they
were
calling
me

and
they
said
somebody
's
got
to
pick
him
up

and
i
kept
thinking
that
she
was
going
to
get
picked
up
she
was
going
to
pick
him
up
because
she
only
lives
in
like
two
blocks
away
from
the
school

i
was
trying
to
get
my
husband
to
come
and
pick
him
up
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff

and
he
had
a
hundred
and
four
fever

they
could
n't
uh
give
him
anything
because
they
're
not
allowed
to
at
school
and
everything

i
was
so
furious

i
i
quit
that
job

and
i
stayed
home
for
awhile
longer

then
i
went
and
got
a
uh
a
job
in
real
estate
where
i
can
kind
of
adjust
my
time
a
little
bit
better

yeah

but
uh
i
have
n't
had
any
good
really
very
good
experience
with
child
care

well
we
in
in
in
our
family
have
been
pretty
remiss
in
trying
to
uh
you
know
keep
track
of
uh
daily
finances

uh
the
uh
way
back
what
twelve
years
ago
or
something
when
i
got
my
first
computer
i
did
what
everybody
else
does
which
is
to
put
the
whole
family
budget
on
the
machine
and
put
checks
and
you
know
checkbooks
and
all
this
kind
of
thing

and
we
kept
that
going
for
about
a
month

and
it
became
so
onerous
that
we
gave
up
on
it

you
know
so
uh
the
only
thing
we
're
you
know
that
we
do
now
is
uh
i
keep
a
a
little
spread
sheet
of
uh
what
i
call
the
net
worth
calculation
which
is
just
the
the
present
value
of
various
kinds
of
investments
and
so
worth

uh
and
i
only
update
that
oh
i
do
n't
know
maybe
once
every
quarter
or
so
every
three
months
just
basically
when
the
statements
come
in
you
know
just
to
see
whether
or
not
we
're
falling
you
know
getting
ahead
falling
behind
or
staying
even
or
what

uh
that
's
really
about
you
know
the
extent
of
uh
of
the
kind
of
uh
financial
score
keeping
that
we
're
doing

huh

oh
dear
that
's
terrible

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

oh
i
see

are
you
are
you
married

are
you
living
with
a
bunch
of
with
with
people
that
you
're
sharing
expenses

oh
i
see

uh-huh

oh
dear

uh-huh

uh-huh

i
see

uh-huh

a-
oh
i
see

oh
sure

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

you
're
the
first
you
know
uh

my
next
door
neighbor
just
lost
his
job
in
a
you
know
one
of
these
uh

his
company
went
broke
i
mean
went
you
know
bankrupt

actually
it
was
a
subsidiary
of
a
of
an
outfit
called
u
s
shoe
or
something

i-
i-
it
was
a
computer
subsidiary

i
do
n't
know
what
a
shoe
company
's
doing
running
a
computer
company

but
uh
you
know
they
just
folded
it
up
and
uh
uh
told
him
to

they
took
the
top
management
and
gave
them
jobs
with
the
with
the
corporate
uh
at
the
corporate
front
office

and
everybody
else
was
sent
packing

uh
hang
on
one
second

i
've
got

uh
somebody
was
knocking
on
my
door
here

uh
it
sounds
like
in
a
certain
sense
at
least
at
the
present

i
mean
it
sounds
sounds
terrible
to
say

but
at
the
present
stage
you
probably
are
even
more
in
the
market
for
a
a
budgetary
thing
than
than
most
people
probably
ar-
might
be
in
terms
of
keeping
keeping
score
of
input
and
output

do
you
have
do
you
have
a
computer
at
home

or

uh-huh

uh-huh

i
see

uh-huh

yeah

have
you
do
you
use
a
standard
uh
a
standard
spread
sheet

or
i
mean

uh-huh

that
sounds
about
right

uh-huh

right

uh

well
it
's
kind
of
difficult
for
me
because
right
now
uh
like
most
teachers
i
'm
laid
off

and

so
um
i
spend
most
you
know

i
substitute
a
lot

so
it
's
a
lot
it
's
very
hard
on
a
nonfixed
income
because
i
do
n't
know
how
many
days
i
'm
going
to
be
called
in
and
whether
i
am
or
not
to
try
to
keep
track
of
finances

and
but
i
know
how
much
i
have
to
bring
in
a
month

and
that
's
about
it

that
's
about
as
far
as
we
go

and
then
anything
extra
is
you
know
more
or
less
split
up
between
all
of
us
and
just
thrown
in
the
kitty
more
or
less
for
a
rainy
day

uh
no

i
'm
a
single
mother

i
have
three
children

so
uh
right
now
we
're
on
we
get
f-
you
know
aid
from
the
state
at
this
point
because
there
's
no
other
way
to
do
it

and
my
ex-husband
just
sort
of
took
off
and
does
n't
pay
child
support

so
right
now
i
know
what
i
'm
getting
from
the
state

and
uh
i
have
to
balance
more
or
less
what
i
get
from
the
state
with
my
bills
and
uh
you
know
try
to
work
as
many
days
as
possible
any
time
they
call
me
in

but
i
still
have
to
figure
out

if
i
work
too
many
days
then
i
lose
all
my
state
aid

and
if
i
do
n't
work
enough
days
then
i
do
n't
get
enough
to
meet
the
bills

and
it
's
like
a
juggling
act
every
single
month

like
this
week
i
've
been
just
holding
my
breath
and
hoping
they
'll
call
me
in

but
they
probably
wo
n't
because
next
week
the
kids
have
school
vacation

so
you
know
the
four
days
before
they
only
have
a
four
day
week

and
they
usually
do
n't
need
subs
because
everybody
's
pretty
good
about
coming
in

they
do
n't
like
to
be
absent
before
a
vacation

but
we
're
shopping
around
as
far
as
well
i
'm
shopping
around
as
far
as
trying
to
get
uh
that
's
why
i
'm
doing
this
to
get
some
extra
money
and
uh
getting
pledge
sheets
for
the
boy
scouts

my
kids
are
in
boy
scouts

so
trying
to
get
pledge
sheets
for
the
boy
scouts

because
every
penny
i
bring
in
is
ten
percent
to
me

so
it
's
sort
of
helps
defray
the
costs
a
little
bit

but
you
know
we
do
a
lot
of
robbing
peter
to
pay
paul

i
guess
we
're
in
the
situation
that
a
lot
of
am-
middle-class
americans
are
in

oh
my
lord

really

uh-huh

oh

sure

right

uh-huh

definitely

uh
yes

we
do

and
we
try
to

you
know
i
keep
track
of
every
penny
and
more
or
less
enter
it
in

every
single
day
i
'm
at
the
computer

and
it
's
like
okay
what
do
we
have
left
what
do
we
have
to
pay
what
have
we
paid
this
month
what
has
n't
come
in
yet
you
know

hi

uh
uh
i
i
should
say
something

that
i
'm
the
uh
least
informed

this
is
totally
accidental
that
i
have
to
talk
about
this
topic

but
it
's
i
'm
the
least
informed
person
in
the
whole
united
states

this
has
not
been
determined
yet

but
i
i
i
've
never
read
a
newspaper
in
my
entire
life

and
i
've
i
i
never
watch
t
v
news
nor
listen
to
the
news
on
the
radio
unless
i
'm
just
happening
to
be
listening
to
music
and
they
slip
it
on
in
the
car
radio
before
i
can
turn
it
off

but

well
no

i
i
've
i
've
explored
that
with
lots
of
people

uh
they
've
tried
to
lock
me
up
and
uh
things
like
that

but
uh
uh
i
'm
basically
not
interested

and
i
also
find
the
uh
everything
is
so
slick
and
superficial
and
misguided
and
mis-
and
off
the
uh
uh

what
am
i
trying
to
say
uh

i
do
learn
about
things
largely
from
friends

and
i
occasionally
will
read
something
like
the
new
york
review
of
books

you
know
someone
will
write
a
book
about
something

and
then
i
'll
learn
all
about
this
thing
that
was
in
the
news
two
years
earlier

but
it

and
somehow

and
anything
i
participated
in
or
know
about
when
i
read
about
it
in
the
paper
is
always
so
uh
covered
from
such
a
funny
and
superficial
perspective
that
i
do
n't
have
much
confidence
in
it

but
i
mean
i
do
n't
think
it
's
just
that
i
'm
lazy

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

right

does
n't
want

let
me
ask
by
the
way
just
for
the
record

i
i
'm
i
totally
concede
that
intelligent
people
read
these
things
and
intelligent
people
write
them

so
i
mean
i
'm
not
being
elitist
in
that
sense
i
hope
uh

yeah

what

yeah

by
the
way
when
you
say
most
people
think
it
is

i
think
it
's
like
ninety-nine
point
ninety-nine
think
it
is
percent

oh
you
do
n't

right

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

uh
i
did
on
the
uh
the
supreme
court
hearings
ar-
the
for
uh
uh
the
whole
business
of
uh

see
i
actually
have
a
a

yeah

the
thomas
and
anita
hill
business

i
i
mean
that
's
that
's
the
closest
thing

i
deeply
cared
about
that

uh
and
i
sort
of
had
planned
to
have
dinner
with
a
friend
of
mine

and
when
i
arrived
at
her
house
she
was
engrossed
in
that

we
ended
up
watching
it
for
a
couple
of
hours
zooming
out
and
grabbing
something
to
eat
and
then
zooming
back
and
ea-
watching
it
some
more

and
i
thought
that
was
terrific
because
she
actually
helped
me
understand
what
was
going
on

but
even
then
i
did
n't
end
up
doing
it
on
my
own
uh
uh

uh-huh

right

right

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

do
you
ever
read

hi

uh-huh

any
particular
reason

uh-huh

huh

uh-huh

i
really
do
n't

i
i
i
like
to
refer
to
this
as
sort
of
consumer
report
phenomenon
which
is
everybody
that
i
know
reads
consumer
reports
so
the
people
who
do
feel
that
consumer
reports
does
a
wholly
inadequate
job
in
their
area
of
particular
interest
but
assume
that
they
do
a
reasonable
job
in
other
areas
uh
without
thinking
that
there
were
people
in
who
think
each
other
areas
area
of
of
specialty

and
uh
i
guess
you
could
explain
it
two
ways

and
and
the
cynical
view
is
well
these
things
are
n't
doing
a
very
good
job
at
all

and
the
view
that
i
would
rather
take
is
that
there
's
a
different
amount
of
information
you
need
when
you
're
particularly
interested
in
a
topic
or
uh
particularly
interested
in
buying
something
as
a
you
know
as
a
hobbyist
versus
when
you
want
to
go
out
and
buy
a
blender
because
you
need
to
mix
things

and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
with
news

if
you
want
to
just
have
an
idea
as
to
what
's
going
on
most
papers
a-
and
especially
the
better
papers
the
the
times
the
wall
street
journal
the
washington
post
give
you
a
reasonable
idea

if
you
were
deeply
involved
in
it
then
you
immediately
realize
that
what
they
print
is
stuff
that
you
probably
knew
already
and
the
stuff
that
you
want
they
're
not
printing
because
the
average
person
does
n't
need
or
want
to
know
that
much

well
i
mean
there
's
there
's
a
reasonable
question
as
to
whether
it
's
worth
the
amount
of
time
it
takes
to
keep
up
on
things

and
most
people
think
it
is

and
i
can
i
can
you
know
accept
that
some
people
think
it
's
not
and
can
find
better
ways
to
use
it

i
do
n't
think
it
's
that
high

i
know
a
lot
of
people
who
may
watch
the
t
v
news
in
the
evening
but
do
n't
spend
the
time
to
actually
read
a
newspaper

and
i
think
they
're
saying
well
if
something
's
really
important
i
'll
at
least
find
out
that
it
happened

and
and
that
's
a
that
's
is
a
reasonable
start

and
for
awhile
i
did
n't
read
a
newspaper
when
i
came
out
here
because
i
did
n't
find
one
that
i
liked

uh
and
if
something
important
happened
it
was
covered
on
t
v

and
i
could
then
go
and
and
pick
up
newspapers
if
if
it
were
important
enough
to
read
about

and
i
imagine
you
get
the
same
level
of
something
that
you
cared
about
happened
you
'd
find
out
from
friends
or
other
channels

clarence
thomas
or

right

uh-huh

yeah

i
stayed
as
far
away
from
those
as
i
could

i
decided
i
did
n't
want
to
waste
the
time

i
had
i
guess
five
years
ago
now
wasted
that
kind
of
time
with
oliver
north
hearings
and
afterwards
decided
that
what
i
had
gotten
out
of
it
just
was
n't
worth
the
time
i
put
in
and
that
these
things
are
just
very
slow
in
seeing
information
come
out

wha-
what
sort
of
company
do
you
work
for

do
you
work
for
a
big
or
a
little
place

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

well
i
i
work
for
uh
actually
probably
similar
kind
of
place

i
work
for
uh
lincoln
laboratory

uh
yeah

we
actually
do
some
work
with
some
people
down
at
georgia
tech

uh
and
uh

so
we
're
we
're
part
we
're
actually
part
of
m
i
t

so
it
's
very
much
the
same
kind
of
place
and
uh
the
technical
institution

uh
while
i
was
sitting
here
waiting
while
they
tried
to
find
somebody
for
me
to
talk
to
trying
to
think
of
what
uh
uh
what
things
were
important
uh
besides
salary
and
a
and
a
job
i
guess
uh
list
i
had
scribbled
down
was
the
people
you
worked
with
and
maybe
the
uh
the
challenge
of
the
work
and
uh
the
working
conditions
things
like
that

i
do
n't
know

what
are
your
uh
what
sorts
of
things
would
you
consider
important

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

now
how
do
you
mean
that

i
know
it

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
you
you
think
it
's
better
than
to
to
try
to
spread
the
the
effort
equally
among
all
the
employees
of
the
company

or

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

i
've
heard
of
a
couple
of
companies
that
have
done
that

i
think
uh
back
about
a
few
years
ago
when
things
were
tough
hewlett-packard
did
that
for
awhile

they
went
to
a
uh
a
a
four
and
a
half
day
work
week
rather
than
cut
yeah
just
cut
everybody
back
ten
percent
and
uh
have
to
give
everybody
a
half
day
a
week
off

and
i
think
you
can
do
that
for
a
little
while

but
i
'm

yeah

uh
i
work
for
georgia
tech

yes
sir

i
work
for
the
research
facility

uh
and
it
's
it
's
kind
of
small
in
a
sense

but
it
it
does
have
about
uh
i
guess
two
thousand
civil
employees

and
on
a
a
scale
i
guess
it
's
still
considered
small

it
just
have
a
lot
of
different
laboratories

the
area
i
work
in
it
it
primarily
have
maybe
a
hundred
people
or
so

so
that
's
make
up
most
of
the
laboratory

so
from
from
that
standpoint
it
's
pretty
small
it
's
pretty
small

what
about
yourself

oh
okay

oh
okay

i
see

oh
okay

right
uh

uh-huh

right

well
those
and
probably
the
security
aspect
of
it

because
a
lot
of
time
nowadays
even
though
you
're
working
uh
you
're
treated

and
it
may
not
be
true
in
every
place

in
a
lot
of
cases
i
think
you
're
treated
more
like
a
number
instead
of
a
a
person

because
when
it
come
down
to
layoff
they
do
n't
really
consider
people
and
and
you
know
their
well
being
as
far
as
you
know
how
they
going
their
next
dollar
going
to
come
in

how
they
going
to
pay
their
bills

they
just
lay
them
off

and
i
was
reading
this
book
one
time
about
this
guy
that
had
uh

i
think
the
company
still
exists

what
they
use
to
do
is
they
used
to
cut
the
number
of
hours
for
everybody
as
opposed
to
just
laying
people
off
you
know

that
way
that
you
know
one
person
would
n't
get
one
big
blunt
blow
at
one
time

and
uh
you
know
i
think
if
they
had
programs
that
set
up
to
subsidize
people
that
do
get
laid
off
a
little
bit
better
you
know
other
than
s-
you
know
something
like

unemployment
is
good

but
i
mean
the
company
as
a
whole

because
you
as
an
employee
even
the
company
is
making
money

they
paying
you
a
salary

but
you
are
responsible
for
that
company
growth

you
're
responsible
also
for
helping
that
company
get
to
the
par-
point
that
it
's
at
at
making
profits

so
there
should
be
something
in
there
or
some
kind
of
clause
that
will
subsidize
people
if
they
did
lose
their
job
other
than
you
know
uh
neglect
or
something
like
that

you
know
because
it
's
not
a
person
's
fault
that
you
know
people
not
buying
or
businesses
are
are
not
on
the
up
and
up
all
the
time
you
know

i
do
n't
see
how
one
or
two
people
maybe
more
one
or
two
but
you
know
a
number
of
people
can
can
be
the
downfall
of
com-
a
company
situation

well
in
a
sense
that
say
how
do
you
make
a
a
conclusion
that
you
're
going
to
lay
off
these
ten
people
uh
for
the
bad
times
of
the
company

what
about
the
the
work
effort
those
ten
people
did
when
the
company
was
doing
well

you
know
in
that
standpoint

ye-
yes

i
do

i
really
do

i
think
it
'd
be
better
that
way

and
even
at
that
it
would
at
least
give
the
person
time
to
look
for
another
job
because
they
know
that
that
there
are
problems

and
you
know
there
are
reason
to
look
for
another
job
instead
of
just
dumping
it
on
them
all
at
one
time

you
know
that
's
just
that
's
my
views
you
know

right

right

right

well
at
least
that
would
give
a
person
a
chance
to
look
you
know
because
the
way
it
is
a
person
really
do
n't
have
a
chance

okay

yes

yeah

well
i-
i
i
i
feel
like
uh
i
am
from
mars

i
mean
i
'm
fifty
years
old

and
uh
i
've
been
divorced
for
um
eighteen
years

but
i
've
two
kids
and
all

but
i
uh
i
i
've
never
had
a
budget

and
i
do
n't
uh
do
any
planning

and
i
do
n't
know

i
do
n't
uh
uh
i
do
n't
have
a
long-term
financial
plan

i
do
n't
try
to
control
my
expenses

but
i
'm
i
'm
glad
you
're
a
stranger

but
really
i
'm
i
happy
i
i
well
i
'm
curious
how
other
people
live

uh
so
maybe
we
should
start
with
you

what
do
you
do

really

oh

maybe
they
're
going
to
arrest
us
both

wow

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh
the
uh

i
had
a
part-time
job
around
oh
gosh
fifteen
years
ago
seventy-six

and
uh
uh
this
was
a
sort
of
a
career
shift
at
the
time

and
so
i
was
willing
to
take
a
half
time
job
to
do
that

and
i
actually
did

my
bank
account
would
uh

i
'd
i
i
kept
bouncing
checks
just
at
the
end
of
the
month

but
i
i
had
miscalculated

i
well
i
did
n't
keep
a
balance

it
's
one
of
the
problems

i
never
had
to
in
the
past

i
always
kept
plenty
of
money
in
my
checking
account

but
when
you
're
only
earning
half
the
salary
even
though
i
was
n't
spending
much
money
i
sometimes
i
sometimes
would
just

things
would
get
to
tight

uh
and
sometimes
what
i
would
do
is
keep
a
piece
of
paper
in
my
wallet

and
every
time
i
uh
i
spent
money
i
mean
cash
mostly
i
would
uh
write
it
down
so
i
could
see
at
the
end
of
a
month
how
much
i
spent
on
food
so
i
could
do
better
planning

but
i
would
forget
to
write
the
things
down

and
it
that
i
i
do
n't
know
if
i
ever
went
as
far
as
three
months
or
not
i-
i-
in
keeping
that
kind
of
data

i
certainly
have
n't
done
that
in
sixteen
years
or
whatever

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

the
uh

i
i-
i
have
to
say
that

let
's
see
at
this
point
on
i
do
n't
run
out
of
money

uh
and
it
uh

a-
and
i
do
n't
i
mean

someday
if
i
were
to
get
remarried
i
might
want
to
buy
a
house
which
requires
lots
of
money
which
i
do
n't
have

and
i
i
i
think
my
strategy
if
if
i
may
i-
i-
is
to
is
to
not
spend
money

i
mean
i
do
n't
have
expensive
tastes

i
do
n't
go
out

i
mean
i
buy
a
car

well
the
last
car
i
got
rid
of
i
'd
had

it
was
nineteen
years
old

pe-
people
were
embarrassed
for
me

i
mean
it
was
it
was
a
good
car

and

oh
it
was
great

my
my
mechanics
loved
it
because
it
was
an
old
it
was
a
sixty-five
buick

and
it
just
would
n't
stop

uh
and
it

i
i
just
did
n't
feel
the
need
for
a
new
car

it
is
n't
like
i
could
n't
afford
one

uh
and
now
i
mean
i
i
do
n't
uh

i
tend
to
eat
expensive
food

i
mean
i
do
n't
mind
buying
a
good
steak

but
for
me
i
only
do
that
every
week
or
without
even
i
mean
maybe
once
a
month

i
mean
you
buy
a
a
tenderloin
steak
it
costs
outrageous
like
twelve
dollars
a
pound

you
buy
a
a
less
than
half
a
pound
so
it
's
six
or
seven
dollars

to
me
i
realize
if
you
have
eight
kids
you
're
not
going
to
run
out
and
do
that

but
but
i
'm
just
i
'm
just
saying
as
a
single
person
that
's
that
's
a
drop
in
the
bucket

and
so
if
you
're
extravagant
on
how
you
buy
food
it
does
n't
add
up
if
you
're
buying
i
mean
if
you
're
not
going
to
super
expensive
restaurants
which
i
do
n't
care
to
go
to

so
so
that
's
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
i
do
n't
need
to
budget
is
that
i
do
n't
have
i
do
n't
i
do
n't
have
to
hold
myself
back
from
buying
that
expensive
thing
because
i
ca
n't
afford
it
because
i
'm
not
interested
in
that
expensive
thing

how
are
you

you
want
to
go
ahead
and
start
talking
about
whether
you
budget

that
sounds
kind
of
like
me

about
the
same
thing

yeah

i
'm
even
in
worse
shape
because
i
have
eight
children

and
uh
we
live
from
hand
to
mouth

we
hope
that
there
's
enough
money
at
the
end
of
the
month
to
pay
for
the
bills
and
if
there
's
not
then
we
due
for
the
next
month

a
couple
of
times
we
've
tried
some
things

and
they
worked

but
i
'm
not
disciplined
enough
to
keep
doing
it

the
best
program
we
ever
had
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
we
took
and
uh
took
my
check
and
divided
it
out
into
envelopes
and
then
paid
for
the
expenses
out
of
that
envelope

and
when
the
envelope
was
empty
then
you
did
n't
have
any
more
money
to
spend
in
that
area

and
that
worked
out
real
well
cause
we
did
n't
have
to
keep
writing
down
what
we
'd
spent

it
was
just
that
when
that
was
empty
you
knew
you
were
out
of
money

and
we
did
that
pretty
successfully
for
about
three
months

and
then
we
started
borrowing
from
one
envelope
to
put
it
in
the
other
envelope

and
in
about
two
months
we
were
back
to
doing
the
same
thing
we
always
do

uh-huh

uh-huh

i
even
find
now
like
with
the
automatic
tellers
i
'll
go
take
money
out
of
that

and
then
i
forget
to
take
that
out
of
my
checking
account

and
uh

so
i
i
i
leave
a
little
bit
of
a
slush
fund
in
my
checking
account
and
i
figure
that
so
the
balance
showing
in
the
checking
account
is
always
somewhat
different
that
what
's
really
there

and
i
figure
that
gives
me
room
for
the
mistakes
i
make

yeah

but
it
was
still
running

uh-huh

yeah

not
very
often

that
's
right

a
lot
of

you
want
to
go
first

okay

uh
one
of
the
things
they
talked
about
was
uh
did
we
d-
wh-
what
do
we
think
about
a
judge
making
the
decision

and
i
really
do
n't
agree
with
that

i
think
that
the
trial
by
jury
is
better
uh
you
know
than
e-
having
a
unanimous
decision
rather
than
to
have
one
person
be
responsible

i
do
n't
think
that
they
could
be
objective
in
every
case
every
time

yo-
you
know
what
i
mean

yeah

right

that
's
it

well
i
i
feel
the
other
thing
too
uh

they
were
saying
uh
you
know
what
new
ways
could
y-
could
it
you
you
know
change
the
system

i
i
really
think
that
uh
we
spend
a
lot
of
time
uh
going
through
appeal
after
appeal
after
appeal
after
appeal

i
mean
i-
if
you
go
to
a
trial
by
jury
and
especially
if
a
person
has
confessed
if
they
have
been
caught
you
know
point
blank
in
the
crime
there
's
uh
no
question

it
's
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt

you
know
all
these
things

i
mean
you
know
we
've
gone
through
this
over
and
over
again

and
it
can
go
on
for
ten
twenty
years

i
i
think
this
is
a
little
ridiculous

i
think
the
only
people
who
benefit
from
that
are
the
lawyers

i
i
'm
serious

and
i
think
that
the
lawyers
have
caused
a
lot
of
the
problems
tha-
that
exist
in
the
s-
in
the
criminal
system
today
with
plea
bargaining

you
know
if
someone
is
ill

well

well
i
know

that
's
what
i
'm
saying

but
i
think
a
lot
of
all
of
the
whole
criminal
system
is
messed
up
in
in
that
regard

i
mean
you
know
people
who
commit
uh
crimes
that
they

i
do
n't
know
how
it
works
exactly

but
you
know
they
get
lesser
sentences

and
i
understand
that
the
jails
are
full
of
people
you
know
uh
and
that
they
have
to
do
something

but
i
think
that
the
reason
they
are
full
is
because
they
know
that
they
can
get
away
with
it

yo-
you
know
what
i
'm
saying

that
w-
we
do
n't
have
uh
well
a
lot
of
states
do
n't
have
capital
punishment

and
uh
i
i
think
they
should

i
and
i
think
if
a
person
is
guilty
of
taking
someone
's
life
and
like
you
say
it
's
it
's
there
's
no
doubt
whatsoever
like
drunk
drivers
that
kill
people

and
uh
you
know
all

they
they
're
caught
dead
to
rights

i
i
just
think
that
that
's
they
've
they
've
taken
a
life

and
if
they
should
pay
for
it
with
their
life

yeah

uh-huh

oh
really

it
uh

yeah

i
know
that
that

uh-huh

and
i
do
n't
know

uh
what
would
you
do
to
change
it
to
make
it
better

oh
yeah

i
i
i
do
n't
agree
with
that
at
all

imagine
the
guilt
that
person
would
have

i
mean
burned
out

there
's
there
's
no
possible
way
that
you
could
uh
you
know
feel
good
about
yourself

if
you
had
to
do
something
like
that
day
after
day

no

not
really

well
w-
do
you
think
people
should
have
a
trial
is
they
're
caught
dead
to
rights
like

i
mean
supposing
i
come
up
to
you
and
i
just
point
blank
kill
you

in
other
words
you
're
saying
that
w-
you
have
to
find
out
whether
it
's
premeditated
or
what
the
circumstances
were

yeah

yeah

well
i
i

no

you
can
start

uh-huh

right

right

there
's
there
th-
this
topic
is
kind
of
mute
uh

there
there
's
no
way

we
we
could
n't
survive
in
a
sy-
in
a
juror
syst-
in
a
trial
system
without
a
jury

uh
one
man
can
never
be
one
man
one
woman
can
never
be
objectionable
in
every
case

uh
every
person
has
their
opinions

and
that
's
why
jury
selection
is
often
very
difficult
uh

right

right

they
should
n't
allow
an
appeal

yep

uh-huh

oh
that
's
right

i
work
for
a
law
firm

right

well
plea
bar-
plea
bargaining
is
a
different
story

plea
bargaining
is
something
completely
different

that
that
actually
prevents
trials
or
at
least
speeds
them
up

right

right

huh

right

we
do

right

right

when
you
're
saying
as
far
as
the
appeal
uh
procedure
was
concerned

we
just
have
the
case

i
'm
i
'm
sure
you
've
probably
heard
of
marion
berry

uh
his
f-
last
appeal
was
was
denied
two
days
before
his
sentence
was
up

so
i
mean
his
appeal
was
denied

and
two
days
later
he
got
out
of
jail
for
cocaine
possession

but
uh
that
was
absurd

there
is
never
there
was
no
reason
the
appeal
process
should
have
dragged
on
that
long
for
a
six
month
sentence

well
uh
the
the
only
i
can
i
wa-
you
know

the
appeal
procedure
is
the
only
thing
i
can
possibly
think
of

uh
a-
like
i
said
as
far
as
removing
of
the
jury
and
having
the
judge
sentence
that
's
absurd

there
's
no
way
that
could
work

uh
but

oh
exactly

exactly

right

no
one
would
want
the
job

uh
and
you
know
like
i
said
the
you
know
everyone
has
their
opinions
about
every
case

oh
yeah

i
i
feel
that
everyone
is
everyone
is
uh
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury

that
that
that
right
s-

well
i
mean
were
there
witnesses

right

right

that
you
ca
n't
you
ca
n't
remove
the
jury
regardless
of
the
case

i
mean
you
could
have
fifty
people
in
audience
watching
a
murder
take
place

and
you
you
'd
still
there
's
still
mitigating
circumstances

well
uh
yeah

i
i
'm
employed
by
a
company
that
does
do
uh
random
drug
testing

and
i
've
got
some
very
definite
uh
opinions
about
it
uh
you
know
which
have
n't
changed
all
that
much
from
my
first
reactions
from
from
when
they
when
they
announced
it
but
uh
developed
a
little
more
i
guess
but
have
n't
changed
that
much

what
about
you

are
you
uh
in-
involved
at
all

yes

yeah

right

yeah

yeah

yeah

it
uh
that
's
that
's
mine

it
it
you
know

i
i
go
back

it
to
me
no
matter
how
much
the
th-
our
company
claims
it
's
not
a
constitutional
issue
that
because
this
is
uh
between
a
company
and
an
employee
it
is
not
it
is
not
a
government

it
's
not

the
constitution
does
n't
apply

but
i
it
it
seems
to
me
that
it
still
should

i
i
our
company
's
doing
it
because
they
're
a
uh
government
contractor

uh
and
so
it
's
it
's
required
for
certain
some
form
some
form
of
drug
program
is
required
to
get
the
government
contracts

and
i
'd
i
'd
yes

okay

an-
and
our
company
has
taken
that
and
gone
all
the
way

say

okay
uh

first
off
we
do
n't
we
do
n't
have
enough
courage
to
uh
pick
out
the
people
that
that
have
some
sort
of
indication
of
possible
drug
usage
uh
because
that
would
offend
them
uh
if
they
if
they
were
n't

so
we
'll
just
accuse
everybody
of
using
drugs
and
make
it
all
even

uh
and
and
uh

then
uh

but
and
they

so
it
's
a
a
complete
random
testing

w-
well
it
's
random
in
the
sense
that
you
do
n't
know
when

it
is
not
random
in
the
sense
that
they
have
said
that
within
three
years
everyone
in
the
company
will
be
tested

uh
and
uh
you
know
i
i
sit
at
a
terminal
and
and
write
software
all
day

it
it
uh
certainly
has
no
life
threatening
uh
capabilities
uh
you
know
in
in
my
job

and
and
uh
yes

i
i
agree
that
there
are
there
are
uh
jobs
that
are
definitely
life
threatening

and
and
and
th-
there
needs
to
be
a
line
drawn
somewhere
at
rea-
reasonable
and
proper

i-
you
know

well

yeah

i
that
that
i
that
i
will
give
credit
to
to
our
our
company
for
in
that
that
i
think
there
's
there
's
a
couple
of
levels
of
tests
in
terms
of
of
uh
of
drugs

and
e-
e-
essentially
the
first
thing
is
t-
is
on
the
order
of
paper
in
the
urine
and
uh
or
some
you
know

it
's
not
quite
that
simple

but
it
's
fairly
simple

coarse
kind
of
test

and
then
there
's
a
a
much
more
uh
uh
refined
test
uh
uh
spectrography
or
whatever
it
's
called
the
chemo-
chemotography
uh
to
determine
exactly
what
the
what
the
things
are

and
uh

no

i
i
've
been
with
this
company
for
uh
for
sixteen
years
now

and
uh

no

and
it
and
it
and
it
has
it
has
you
know

they
did
that
three
or
four
years
before
they
did
it
with
everybody

and
i
uh
at
that
time
i
could
justify
it
in
terms
of
someone
new
coming
in
you
do
n't
you
do
n't
know

but
on
the
other
hand
uh
someone
new
coming
in
that
knows
they
're
going
to
have
a
test

okay

well
uh
i
'll
let
you
start
i
guess

uh
no

i
mean
i
'm
not

my
employer
does
not
do
that
uh
although
uh
i
had
an
ex-employer
that

uh
the
previous
job
i
used
to
have
uh
they

after
i
guess
a
few
years
after
i
had
started
with
them
they
made
it
a
condition
of
employment
that
you
pass
a
drug
test

uh
i
i
do
n't
know

my
feeling
is
that
certain
jobs
that
when
there
's
immediate
threat
to
life
and
limb
uh
if
should
somebody
be
under
the
influence
of
drugs
i
i
'd
be
willing
to
support
that

for
example
uh
uh
well
uh
uh
train
engineers

because
it
you
know
uh
like
there
was
an
incident
several
years
ago
where
an
amtrak
engineer
you
know

he
crashed
and
killed
some
people
because
he
was
uh
smoking
some
marijuana

and
i
guess
air
traffic
controllers
i
would
n't
want
them
to
be
on
drugs
and
airplane
pilots

but
where
it
's
not
necessary
uh
in
that
regard
where
it
's
not
an
immediate
threat
to
life
and
limb
or
property
uh
i
i
'd
i
would
seriously
question
it

uh
so

so
it
's
the
government
that
's
mandating
it
to
a
certain
extent

yeah

well
i-

huh

right

and

yeah

yeah

i
agree

i
mean
it
's
well
there
's
also
the
issue
of
uh

o-
o-
out
here
i
remember
hearing
a
year
or
so
ago
that
uh
a
lot
of

there
was
a
high
error
rate
in
the
analysis
of
drug
results

o-
or
i
should
n't
say
high

i
mean
several
percent

kind
of
a
coarse
kind
of
test

is
that
done

right

now
l-
let
me
ask
you
this

uh
e-
e-
at
the
time
you
hired
on
with
this
company
uh
was
that
prior
to
any

okay

so
that
this
is
obviously
not
a
condition
of
employment
that
you
subject
yourself
to
this

uh
with
regard
to
uh
to
jury
trials
i
you
know
i
i
really
feel
as
though
uh
jury
trials
are
are
uh
whatever
system
has
been
been
used
historically
in
particular
jurisdiction
you
know
is
really
the
the
only
kinds
of
things
that
you
can
use
because
the
the
jurisprudence
is
you
know
based
on
on
uh
you
know
on
accumulated
n-
body
of
law

and
if
if
you
have
a
situation
where
you
change
that
body
of
law
then
all
of
sudden
they
they
start
they
could
start
going
back
and
digging
up
all
these
cases
that
uh
that
would
be
handled
differently
were
they
judged
by
today
's
standards

so
i
i
really
do
n't
think
it
they
can
really
do
much
of
anything
to
change
it

what
do
you
think

well
wo
n't

well
maybe
they
used
a
little
bit
too
much
force
with
stuff
like
that

but
then
then
you
know
the
defense
lawyer
addressed
each
and
every
one
of
those
blows
apparently

and
you
know
the
other
two
guys
sat
in
the
car

and
they
did
n't
get
beat
up
you
know

rodney
got
beat
up
because
he
he
you
know
he
pur-
you
know
he
involved
himself
in
some
sub
self-destructive
behavior

and
uh
uh
just
like
the
burning
and
looting
is
self-destruct

everybody
says
well
this
is
the
nineties

and
they
're
going
to
rebuild

and
it
'll
be
even
better

hey
what
do
you
think

you
know
some
some
black
guy
with
capital
is
going
to
come
in
and
invest
in
that
area

with
everybody
with
that
mind
set
they
they
're
they
're
going
to
that
whole
area
is
going
to
be
turned
into
residential
ghetto
you
know

and
you
might
even
be
able
to
to
use
it
for
for
a
bombing
test
site
you
know

well
e-
everybody
is
saying
this
is
going
to
be
a
new
era

and
we
're
going
to
reexamine
this
thing

hey
the
b-
the
average
person
is
going
to
take
a
look
at
that
and
say
suspicions
confirmed

they
're
a
bunch
of
animals
you
know

how
can
you
really
deal
with
an
environment
where
you
're
going
to
lose
everything

forty
deaths

i
mean
there
are
forty
people
that
are
dead
as
a
result
of
that

and
i
'm
just
trying
to
determine
you
know
how
you
address
how
you
weigh
you
know
rodney
getting
getting
the
hell
beat
out
of
him
against
you
know
forty
deaths

yeah

and
there
's
no
other

i
'm
not
su-
exactly
sure
uh
what
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
deaths

and
i
'm
very
upset
that
the
news
media
has
not
identified
those
deaths
and
and
pursued
it
you
know
because
i
'm
interested
in
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
thing

is
it
a
looter
that
got
shot
by
a
store
owner

i
you
know

no
tears

yeah

and
and
so
i
but
i
i
suspect
a
number
of
them

you
know
you
you
see
film
of
people
being
pulled
out
of
a
car
and
shot
you
know
in
in
the
street

and
and
my
reaction
is
i
would
have
run
over
fifty
people
before
rather
than
stop

and
uh
and
there
there
would
have
been
just
nothing
but
carnage
after
after
after
if
i
'd
been
at
the
wheel

no
one
would
have
stopped
me

right

i
'm
inside
the
beltway

you
know
how
capital
gang
they
always
say
well
inside
the
beltway
they
think
thus

and
so
and
i
say
well
wait
a
minute

i
'm
inside
the
beltway

and
i
do
n't
think
like
that

i
'm
a
government
employee

i
'm
with
the
f
b
i

yes

an-
and
so
uh
uh
and
and
the
reason
i
'm
doing
this
whole
thing
is
because
rick
whose
another
government
employee
wanted
a
spe-
segments
of
my
speech
that
that
were
done
a
year
ago

and
he
wanted
another
collection
a
year
later

and
so
this
is
my
seventh
call

a
year
ago
i
did
eleven
calls

and
so
that
's
that
's
why
uh
uh
that
's
why
i
'm
religiously
getting
on
the
phone
because
i
have
a
unique
you
know
i
have
a
unique
situation
here
in
that
if
i
do
n't
participate

uh
i
i
do
n't
think
so

possibly
in
the
jury
selection
would
be
the
only

just
for
example
what
we
're
seeing
in
california
i
guess

it
makes
you
wonder
uh
had
the
jury
been
a
different
group
of
people
what
would
have
happened
with
that
outcome

uh
and
th-
and
the
problems
that
that
has
come
that
has
come
from
this
decision
that
that
jury
came
to
after
all
of
us
witnessed
what
we
did
with
the
video
tape
beating
uh
just
makes
you
wonder
i
guess
whether
or
not
they

uh-huh

that
's
that
's
bad

uh-huh

no

it

uh-huh

uh-huh

oh
yes

that
's
right

they
're
only
going
to
suffer

t-
they
're
only
going
to
suffer

they
they
've
defeated
themselves
with
with
their
looting
and
violence

uh
i
understand
why
they
were
upset
by
the
verdict
just
because
even
those
of
us
that
are
n't
black
or
uh
do
n't
live
there
or
whatever
we
all
saw
the
same
thing
on
the
on
the
tape

and
uh

i
know

yeah

it
's
really
ridiculous

against
forty
other
people
being

those
deaths

uh-huh

or
just
a
by-
an
innocent
bystander
or
somebody
got
actually
beat
to
death
or
what

um

or
or
beaten

um

right

that
's
that
's
exactly
how
i
feel
too

i
would
n't
have
uh
they
would
n't
have
stopped
my
car
for
any
anything
had
i
seen
them
coming

but
i
was
just
wondering
since
you
're
you
're
in
you
're
back
east
uh
and
a
little
closer
to
the
the
bigger
cities
than
we
are
in
idaho
here

oh

uh-huh

oh

in
what
uh
section
of
the
government
do
you
work

oh

oh
that
's
interesting

uh-huh

oh

oh
i
see

uh
around
here
we
have
a
program
where
uh
we
we
put
out
the
the
we
separate
the
bottles
and
the
cans
and
the
plastic
stuff
from
the
newspapers

and
we
keep
the
newspapers
in
a
in
a

they
're
collected
twice
a
month
and
the
trash
and
and
this
bottled
stuff
that
is
put
in
a
in
a
little
blue
bin
that
's
picked
up
and
sorted
out
into
a
truck

so
they
ma-
actually
have
about
three
passes
at
this
collection
one
for
the
regular
trash
one
for
the
uh
uh
you
know
the
bottles
and
cans
and
one
for
the
newspapers

no

they
they
do
that
on
the
truck

they
separate
them
as
they
as
they
you
know
dump
them

and
you
know
one
guy
comes
around
with
his
truck
and
and
dumps
it
all
in
there

and
i
think
they
're
they
're
running
out
of
uh
you
know

the
sanitary
landfill
i
think
uh
is
you
know
running
out

of
course
uh
you
being
from
new
mexico
you
've
probably
been
n-
to
washington
especially
if
you
're
your
present
location

you
must
have
come
to
washington
at
least
once

my
you
've
got
a
lot
a
a
lot
of
nothing
out
there
you
know

they
got

i
mean
there
there
's
got
to
be
a
crevice
between
two
mountains
that
nobody
gives
a
doggone
about
that
you
could
you
could
use
for
landfill

well
what
other
we-
we-
what
uh
what
unique
things
you
think
uh
that
you
can
do
about
it
in
in
what
in
los
alamos

uh
other
other
than
nuking
it

well
is
n't
that
a
that
's
a
that
's
pretty
uh
upscale
uh
trash
uh
uh
situation

i
do
n't
think
anybody
around
here
would
understand
all
the
all
those
exotic
techniques
you
know
getting
rid
of
the
heavy
metals

huh

we-

huh

well
that
's
certainly
uh
you
know
uh
getting
into
the
swim
of
things

i
i
think
it
should
be
i-
it
should
go
to
the
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
though
and
say
okay
guy

you
y-
everybody
gets
you
know
five
pounds
of
garbage
that
they
can
throw
away
you
know

uh
but
more
than
that
every
week
uh
you
've
got
to
pay
by
the
pound

i
i
think
i
think
people
would
be
would
get
very
very
you
know
they
'd
be
very
careful
about
how
they
bought
stuff

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

well
of
course
that
uh
you
know
those
big
trucks
can
can
probably
are
far
more
efficient
in
packing
than
any
kind
of
little
household
compactor

sounds

but
i
gather
you
do
not
separate
uh
the
bottles
and
cans

uh-huh

yes

yes

i
know

not
only
have
i
come
to
washington
but
uh
i
find
it
very
amusing
that
uh
the
thing
that
was
just
instituted
here
is
very
similar

that
is
we
also
have
blue
bins

we
also
separate
newspapers
from
all
of
the
other
stuff
which
goes
into
the
bin
and
gets
separated
in
the
truck
and
uh
landfill
space
is
in
deed
the
driving
factor
here

and
in
fact
uh
despite
all
of
our
open
space
out
here
landfill
space
is
still
uh
very
hard
to
come
by

a-

ah

but
if
somebody
can
make
a
regulation
about
it
they
will

well
uh

yes

other
than
nuking
it

um
in
fact
los
alamos
uh
has
uh
done
a
fair
amount
of
research
uh
in
recycling
things
in
general

um
it
it
involves
for
instance
uh
creating
biological
organisms
which
can
remove
heavy
elements
like
selenium
and
barium
and
uh
other
things
from
uh
waste
material
in
general
and
uh
and
purify
the
waste
of
specific
uh
uh
nasty
elements

and
the
thing
that
just
was
in
the
local
news
bulletin
was
somebody
has
uh
ter-
made
some
special
uh
polymers
that
have
the
ability
to
uh
make
certain
actinide
elements
adhere
to
them

uh
uh
they
've
uh
looked
at
uh
plutonium
and
uranium
and
uh
some
other
similar
things
to
try
to
remove
those
from
radio
active
waste

and
again
this
is
driven
by
all
of
the
documentation
and
uh
e
s
and
h
uh
uh
considerations
that
uh
people
are
uh
worrying
about
i
think
much
more
than
they
should

actually
i
've
been
involved
in
recycling
for
long
before
it
became
fashionable

back
when
i
was
in
graduate
school
i
did
all
of
the
recycling
of
the
uh
paper
from
the
computer
center

and
uh
in
fact
i
think
i
was
the
first
person
in
our
department
to
have
my
thesis
published
on
recyclable
pa-
recycled
paper

i
think
that
's
a
wonderful
idea

the
only
alternative
i
would
see
is
uh
and
this
would
actually
be
a
little
more
workable
since
weighing
everybody
's
garbage
would
be
a
real
pain
uh
if
you
did
it
by
volume
rather
than
by
weight
it
would
uh
speak
more
directly
to
the
space
needs
and
the
landfill

and
it
would
also
cause
people
to
compact
their
garbage
more

uh
and
uh
and
limiting
the
volume
is
probably
a
little
bit
closer
to
the
real
problem
than
limiting
the
weight

well
my
exercise
program
consists
of
uh
you
know

it
's
it
's
a
opportunity
to
stay
alive
really
instead
of
you
know
wasting
my
my
the
you
know
the
trying
to
exist
on
the
latency
of
my
youth
the
good
health
of
my
youth

i
'm

and
what
i
like
to
do
is
i
like
to
stretch
out

and
i
like
to
run
uh
m-

i
'm
i
like
to
run
get
my
heartbeat
up

i
like
to
run
about
oh
about
two
two
and
a
half
miles

and
then
i
like
to
work
out
on
uh
on
the
uh
the
bailey
life
c-
cycle
machines
up
here
at
the
at
the
holiday
spa

and
and
i
i
think
that
you
know

i
've
had
a
regiment
now
for
about
you
know
ten
fifteen
years
of
of
doing
that

and
uh
and
i
i
kind
of
think
it
's
uh
it
's
a
lot
of
work

but
i
think
it
's
uh
it
's
a
lot
of
work

but
i
think
it
's
uh
it
's
the
uh
the
amount
of
effort
that
's
required
to
uh
to
stay
healthy
you
know

i
have
a
sedentary
job

and
uh
unless
you
do
something
like
that
y-
you
're
going
to
get
sick

well
i
uh
two
years
ago
i
started
having
trouble
with
my
knee

and
uh
you
know
i
've
got
you
know

i
figured
well
it
'll
go
away

well
i
s-
you
know
i
'm
i
've
had
to
reduce
my
program
reduce
my
program

and
i
've
gained
fifteen
pounds

and
so
uh
you
know
it
's
e-
you
know

i
need
to
get
back
into
swimming
you
know
instead
of
running

if
i
ca
n't
swim
or
i
ca
n't
run
i
should
be
able
to
swim

well
i
'm
such
a
terrible
swimmer

and
i
i
i
really
feel
i
can
i
can
dedicate
about
an
hour
an
hour
and
fifteen
minutes
f-
to
this
effort

but
if
it
gets
longer
than
that
i
i
i-
it
i
start
not
doing
anything

and
so
so
i
got
a
real
problem
in
that
regard

uh
it

do

you
obviously
are
are
not
an
exercise
buff
or
else
you
'd
be
out
there
doing
it

well
it
's
it
's
always
a
chore

i
mean
i
started
doing
this
when
i
was
about
thirty-five

and
now
i
'm
fifty-five

and
uh
you
know
i
i
know
that
in
i
just
know
that
i
'm
going
to
get
blown
away
with
some
some
piece
of
nonsense

y-
you
know
some
health
related
thing
is
going
to
blow
me
away

that
's
the
same
way

i
got
too
much
weight
on
right
now

i
need
to
lose
fifty
pounds
you
know

i
need
to
lose
at
least
twenty
you
know

but
uh
you
know
it
's
it
's
just
uh
i
'm
busy

i
'm
doing
a
lot
of
traveling

and
uh
it
it
creates
a
problem
uh
you
know
when
you
're
on
the
road

what
sort
of
uh
uh
what
other
programs
other
than
say
running

have
you
have
you
ever
done
anything
at
all

uh-huh

club
what
club
are
you
with

what
club
were
you
with

oh
okay

so
you
're
you
're
down
you
're
downtown

okay

yeah

you
're
down
there
on
you
know
twentieth
and
eighteenth
and
f
g

oh

well
i
'd
uh

well
there
's
a
there
's
a
holiday
spa
down
there
on
on
k
street
i
think
something
like
that

but
uh
i
i
go
to
the
holiday
spa
here
in
alexandria

and
that
's
pretty
good

but
you
know
evening
time
it
gets
pretty
busy

but
generally
you
know
i
can
i
can
get
in
and
get
a
program
you
know

but
uh
you
know
i
i
need
to
i
need
to
rededicate
myself
to
uh
to
doing
this

and
uh
i
got
a
problem
uh
you
know
ever
since
my
knee
went
bad
of
getting
back
solidly
into
it

i
mean
i
've
been
doing
this
for
fifteen
twenty
years

and
you
know
and
i
'm
i
know
i
'm
going
to
get
i
know
it
's
going
to
bite
me
in
the
ass

and
so
i
i
really
do
n't
want
to
want
to
uh
you
know
back
off
on
it

well
no

when
you
're
young
you
you
can
abuse
your
your
all
your
systems

and
you
can
recover

uh
when
you
get
to
be
my
age
and
you
start
abusing
your
systems
you
get
blown
away
and
just
wind
up
having
to
kiss
your
ass
good-bye
you
know

and
uh
and
so
the
object

huh

right

yeah

i
'm
i
need
to
get

i
'm
i
'm
pretty
bad
about
that

i
'm
lazy

i
should
i
know

i
want
i
always
say
that
i
need
to
get
run-
start
running

and
i
'm
going
to
try
and
do
that
this
summer

because
i
never
have
time

i
i
always
put
it
off

by
the
time
i
get
back
from
classes
it
's
late
at
night

and
i
do
n't
feel
like
going
back
over
to
the
gym
and
running
on
the
track
or
whatever

because
i
'm
i
'm
getting
a
gut
here

i
got
to
get
back
into
shape

huh

yeah

yeah

i
mean
i
do
it
i
guess

i
'm
going
to
do
it
uh
because
i
want
to
get
in
shape

i
'm
not
it
's
not
something
i
really
enjoy
all
that
much
that
i
'll
i
'll
probably

i
mean
once
i
get
into
it
and
i
if
i
if
i
get
into
better
shape
then
it
'll
be
it
wo
n't
be
as
much
of
a
a
chore
to
me

yeah

huh

yeah

right

yeah

i
have

uh
sit-ups

or
al-
also
last
summer
i
was
doing
nautilus

or
last
year
i
'm
uh
belong
to
a
club
right
here

got
kind
of
expensive
uh
to
r-
to
r-
renew
they
wanted
another
fifty
dollars

that
was
a
little
bit
too
much
money

but
uh
doing
a
mix
of
nautilus
and
free
weights
i
like
that

i
'm
sorry

it
's
called
oh
what
was
it
called
city
sports
downtown
washington

yeah

i
'm
at
i
'm
at
i
go
to
george
washington
university

yeah

it
's
uh
plaza

right

yeah

yeah

it
's
something

i
think
uh
i
'm
young

i
should
get
started
getting
into
shape

i
do
n't
want
to

i
want

i
mean
at
one
point
it
's
going
to
be
too
late
to
do
it

yeah

huh

your
turn

well
i
have
to
say
i
really
do
n't
have
a
budget

both
my
wife
and
i
uh
grew
up
in
uh
families
of
rather
modest
means

and
uh
our
family
income
at
this
point
is
comfortable
upper
middle
class
i
guess
you
might
say

and
uh
we
're
both
so
uh
frugal
that
uh
we
really
do
n't
need
a
budget
you
know

we
just
sort
of
invest
the
money
and
go
on
vacations
and
always
never
seem
to
have
any
money
problems
which
i
guess
is
a
comfortable
thing

well
we
stay
within
our
means

but
we
do
n't
do
it
uh
by
conscious
effort

it
just
sort
of
happens
automatically

although
we
just
moved
to
california

and
uh
the
cost
of
living
here
in
california
is
uh
i
would
say
rather
pathological

uh
housing
prices
are
you
know
like
from
four
to
ten
times
more
expensive
than
uh
uh
they
were
where
i
came
from
in
uh
dallas

yeah

so
uh
uh
that
presents
a
a
real
shock

ac-
ac-
actually
our
standard
of
living
has
gone
down
somewhat
since
we
've
moved
to
california

but

yeah

it
's
god
's
country

uh
and
one
way
you
know
that
is
that
only
god
can
afford
it

uh
so
budget
is
not
a
problem
for
us

uh
at
least
it
has
n't
been

it
may
may
be
at
this
point

but
uh
up
until
this
point
it
really
has
n't
been

when
i
uh
was
in
uh
undergraduate
school
a
long
long
time
ago
i
uh
noted
that
the
monthly
salary
starting
average
monthly
salary
salary
for
engineers
that
you
know
in
my
discipline
was
like
oh
six
hundred
ten
dollars
a
month
or
something
like
that

and
uh
i
noted
at
that
point
that
i
was
you
know
if
that
's
what
my
salary
was
that
i
drew
then
i
would
be
making
almost
twice
as
much
as
my
father
made
during
his
best
year
ever

so
i
stopped
worrying
about
money

and
it

never
have
worried
about
money
since
then

sometimes
uh
it
's
a
bit
of
a
a
problem
you
know
because
i
guess
i
do
n't
really
manage
my
money
the
way
i
should

but
uh
i
suppose
i
've
lost
money
on
not
taking
good
advantage
of
of
uh
investments

but

uh-huh

well
i
guess
we
're
both
lucky
in
that
regard
then

how
big
is
your
family

i
see

so
how

you
whe-
once
you
get
ten
children
though
you
may
have

oh
all
right

i
have
two
kids

uh
one
nine
and
one
thirteen

and
they
are
beginning
to
be
a
budget
problem
but
uh
have
not
been
really
up
until
this
up
to
this
point

i
give
them
a
i
give
them
an
allowance

and
they
uh

i
basically
give
my
son
ten
dollars
a
week

and
i
put
half
of
it
in
the
bank

and
i
give
give
him
the
other
half
in
cold
cash

and
uh
he
has
a
teller
card
so
he
can
uh
do
what
he
wi-
do
what
he
wishes
with
the
money
that
i
put
in
the
bank

but
at
least
it
is
n't
you
know
burning
a
hole
in
his
pocket

if
he
wants
to
use
it
he
has
to
go
get
it

and
that
usually

oh
i
i
start

okay

well
uh
we
keep
a
budget
to
an
extent

uh
and
really
i-
i-
we
were
really
forced
into
keeping
a
budget
because
i
'm
i
'm
paid
once
a
month
which
sort
of
sort
of
forces
some
uh
uh
restrictions

and
you
need
to
make
sure
all
your
bills
are
paid

uh
about
yourself

yeah

well
i
guess
that
really
is
sort
of
uh
keeping
a
budget

you
know
you
stay
within
your
uh
within
your
means

yeah

yes

oh
you
moved
from
dallas
to
san
francisco

that
is
a
hugh
difference

yeah

but
you
have
good
sour
dough

and
it
's
a
beautiful
place
to
live

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

well
that
that
's
a
system
too

well
then
again
you
know
you
said
you
you
are
able
to
take
trips

and
you
do
obviously
have
enough
to
live
on

so
i
guess
you
're
indirectly
budgeting
uh
just
bye-bye
the
fact
that
you
said
you
're
both
very
frugal
uh
in
spending
the
money

so
i
mean
that
's
that
's
a
form
of
budgeting
i
would
think

it
's
it
's
kind
of
a
strange
topic
to
to
try
to
for
two
people
who
do
n't
really
have
a
budget
to
talk
about
budgeting
and
how
they
manage
their
money

yeah

uh
well
we
're
we
have
one
on
the
way

uh
my
wife

and
then
we
're
we
're
having
one
on
the
way
in
uh
in
uh
september

no

i
think
it
's
just
going
to
be
one

how
about
yourself

oh

do
they
budget
at
all

i
mean
do
you
have
them
on
an
allowance

yeah

yeah

capital
punishment
uh
i
guess
out
in
california
is
has
had
a
lot
of
uh
a
lot
of
you
know
discourse
in
the
paper

uh
apparently
you
know
there
's
they
have
n't
uh
executed
anybody
since
nineteen
sixty-seven
i
believe

yeah

they

well
i
we
were
we
uh
we
just
started
we
lived
in
redwood
city
when
we
were
out
there

and
uh
and
we
found
that
uh
you
know
it
was
a
very
liberal
kind
of
community

but
the
uh
i
i
really
feel
that
that
the
law
enforcement
community
uh
you
know
puts
these
people
behind
bars

and
then
they
they
uh
uh
you
know
lawyers
these
lawyer
groups
get
together

and
they
uh
they
i
think
extend
beyond
the
normal
uh
appeal
process
uh
you
know
and
just
drag
these
this
guy
uh
his
his
uh
ultimate
uh
demise
out
for
ten
or
fifteen
years

uh
and
i
i
think
that
uh
that
there
's
something
that
has
to
be
changed
in
the
system
to
to
do
that

i
think
capital
punishment
uh
uh
was
or
probably
stringent
enough

but
i
think
the
appeal
process
is
really
getting
in
the
way

do
do
you
feel
as
though
there
should
be
uh
more
uh
was
or
or
more
uh
you
might
say
transgressions
that
would
be
enforceable
by
uh
by
uh
uh
capital
punishment

uh-huh

well
the
term
technicality

the
law
enforcement
community
uh
uh
you
know
has
to
has
to
separate
the
difference
between
somebody
who
is
being
set
up
in
which
uh
grievous
acts
are
done
to
uh
to
you
know
to
get
somebody
into
a
a
situation
where
they
're
going
to
be
guilty
of
of
a
crime

or
whether
uh
an-
and
whether
the
rights
of
that
individual
are
been
have
been
you
know
impuned

uh
but
or
whether
there
's
just
you
know
a
policeman
has
just
made
a
uh
a
you
know
a
non
a
noncritical
error
though
be
it
not
the
right
way
to
do
it

but
but
you
know
the
the
merits
of
the
case
in
terms
of
you
know
the
guy
was
a
law
breaker
as
being
supportive

now
i
i
'm
a-
a-
at
this
juncture

i
you
know
i
'm
i
'm
not
sure
you
know
what
constitutes
a
a
technicality

you
know
that
that
's
what
all
c-
these
these
hearings
are
about

and
that
's
what
all
these
you
know
court
cases
are
about

i
mean
our
uh
our
our
glorious
uh
you
know
mayor
here
in
washington
is
six
days
away
from
getting
out
of
out
of
the
can

and
uh
you
know
he
he
tried
to
appeal
his
conviction
uh

and
you
know
it
did
n't
work

but
be
that
as
it
may
everybody
who
got
enough
money
will
pump
the
appeal
process
dry

uh
in
in
the
old
days
you
know
and
say
round
about
times
of
battle
of
hastings
you
know
and
the
villages
if
you
were
a
transgressor
they
they
either
you
know
drove
you
out
in
the
woods
or
you
became
a
ward
of
somebody

and
he
you
were
his
slave

and
if
he
did
n't
like
what
you
did
he
killed
you

and
that
has
that
's
pretty
effective

uh
you
know
it
's
not
good
for
civil
rights
i
guess

but
it
's
pretty
effective
in
that
you
know
you
've
got
to
get
along
in
the
community

and
if
you
do
n't
you
'll
perish
either
by
the
hand
of
your
your
your
master
or
by
being
pushed
out
in
the
woods

so
i
i
i
mean
as
as
man
has
gotten
more
complicated
so
all
of
the
uh
imaginations
to
uh
you
know
protect
him
from
from
being
uh
dumped
on
by
uh
civilian
authority
in
in
so-
in
criminal
actions
especially
you
know
murder
cases
and
that
sort
of
thing

uh-huh

uh
yeah

that
's
that
's
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember

well
that
's
before
my
time
actually

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
i
think
that
currently
the
way
the
law
stands
is
n't
so
much
that
the
laws
are
enforceable
or
not

it
's
more
they
're
not
enforcing
the
death
penalty
itself

it
's
at
that
point
where
they
're
saying
like
here
you
're
you
're
going
on
death
row

but
you
'll
stay
there
for
twenty
years

and
nothing
is
being
done
about
it

uh
the
laws
exist
and
are
frequently
upheld
in
in
uh
in
appeals
court
just
because
of
technicalities
and
because
of
maybe
small
little
holes
that
their
defending
attorney
can
find

and
it
's
it
's
really
getting
out
of
hand
in
many
states

well
it
seems
like
well
it
it
seems
as
if
in
the
past
typically
there
have
been
a
lot
of
cases
of
people
being
wrongly
tried
or
wrongly
punished

and
the
whole
idea
behind
the
current
criminal
process
system
is
to
protect
those
who
actually
did
n't
the
crimes
albeit
it
seems
that
we
are
failing
in
that
in
that
ultimate
goal
because
there
are
times
when
people
who
are
guilty
are
getting
off

um
for
instance
um
there
's
a
case
a
few
years
back
where
uh
someone
uh
someone
who
's
being
convicted
for
was
under
a
tri-
was
going
to
trial
for
murder
was
let
off
because
of
a
technicality
in
that
the
of-
the
arresting
officer
uh
did
not
read
the
defendant
their
rights

and
where
his
old
evidence
was
there
the
witnesses
were
there
the
everything
was
conclusively
pointing
to
this
individual
yet

uh
a
lot
of
companies
now
are
are
using
uh
drug
testing
paraphernalia
and
drug
testing
situations
to
to
root
out
the
the
either
uh
elementary
or
intermediate
or
advanced
uh
drug
users

and
uh
i
know
the
the
government
is
uh
you
know
gives
drug
tests
an-
to
all
new
entrants
all
new
appli-
applicants
coming
into
government

and
and
i
quite
frankly
do
n't
see
anything
wrong
with
it

i
i
'm
i
guess
i
'm
not
a
good
civil
libertarian

and
and
i
i
feel
as
though
uh
that
uh
uh
you
know
that
if
you
you
're
a
drug
user
you
have
a
hidden
agenda
that
's
difficult
unless
you
really
go
into
a
deep
background

of
course
we
're
we
're

being
involved
in
my
organization
uh
we
we
have
deep
background
checks

and
and
so
uh
but
but
sometimes
you
know
drug
use
can
can
escape
that

and
uh
i
have
absolutely
no
compunction
about
uh
using
any
and
all
means
to
to
uh
uh
you
know
work
out
figure
out
who
has
a
drug
program
or
who
has
a
drug
problem
and
uh
and
putting
that
guy
into
into
therapy
to
whatever
it
is
to
to
you
know
break
this
uh
activity

of
course
if
he
's
fallen
in
love
with
drugs

and
there
is
n't
anything

but
getting
stoned
or
high
is
is
the
only
thing
in
life
that
seems
to
be
meaningful
then
maybe
there
is
no
hope

what
's
your
uh
feeling

uh-huh

well
i
think
uh
the
dr-
the
laws
on
uh
uh
uh
the
first
morphine
laws
were
were
like
ninety
or
nineteen
ten
or
nineteen
five
something
like
that

yeah

well
the
thing
of
it
is
the
the
tha-
tha-
that
that
is
uh
uh
in
in
many
respects
uh
uh
you
know
just
just
i
think
an
over
simplification

i
i
think
there
th-
th-
th-
there
's
so
much
criminal
activity
uh
that
people
go
into
to
to
support
drug
habits

yeah

you
know
they
they
support
drug
habits
with
uh
with
uh
you
know
with
things
like
uh
you
know
burglary
or
or
prostitution
or
stuff
like
that

yeah

i
i
i
must
admit
that

yeah

yeah

i
i
must
admit
that
the
production
costs
of
of
these
drugs
are
are
zippo
compared
to
the
street
market
costs
and
and
the
costs
to
society

yeah

but
i
i
i
i
think
that
that
the
that
you
know
the
being
in
law
enforcement
you
know
th-
th-
th-
they
i
i
probably
have
a
kind
of
a
draconian
philistine
attitude
toward
it

and
but
but
the
uh
uh
i
i
really
feel
as
though
the
interdiction
effort
is
is

as
soon
as
you
you
get
rid
of
one
goon
that
's
that
's
that
's
involved
in
drugs
and
tha-

yeah

and
then
another
another
one
will
jump
up

but
we
we
see

yeah

a-
a-
as
soon
as
we
wind
up
uh
uh
you
know
for

well
if
we
can
just
destroy
the
market
by
destroying
the
demand

but
but
people
want
to
get
get
stoned

and
i
i
do
n't
see
that

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

sure

huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh
well
i
guess
i
i
guess
i
'm
probably
a
little
more
to
toward
the
other
direction

uh
well
i
guess
mainly
because
uh
it
's
i
well

like
there
's
two
sides
to
it
i
guess

uh
one
is
that
uh
if
you
're
coming
to
work
under
the
influence
of
any
sort
of
drug
alcohol
whatever
or
you
know
even
if
it
's
smoking
inhibits
you
know
your
ability
to
function
then
i
i
think
that
that
you
know
i
do
n't
have
any
problem
at
all
with
testing
that
individual
you
know
on
the
spot

uh
but
i
guess
i
feel
more
like
whatever
you
're
doing
in
your
own
private
life
is
your
own
private
business

uh
and
i
guess
part
of
the
reason
there
is
because
of
the
fact
that
uh
things
like
drug
laws
seem
to
come
and
go

you
know
we
had
prohibition
for
awhile

and
then
we
did
n't
have
prohibition

uh
you
know
we
've
had
i
guess
laws
against
uh
you
know
various
other
forms
of
drugs
for
the
last
what
sixty
or
seventy
years
i
guess

maybe
a
little
longer

yeah

so
ei-
eighty
years
or
so

yeah

uh
so
i

you
know
it
's
it
's
hard
to
i
guess
for
me
to
justify
what
so-
seems
like
you
know
basically
a
breach
of
the
first
amen-
you
know
freedom
from
uh
search
and
seizure
you
know
uh
on
something
that
may
or
may
not
stand
as
a
law
you
know
fifty
years
from
now
or
even
twenty
or
ten

who
knows

i
mean
prohibition
certainly
did
n't
last

well
but
you
got
to
look
at
prohibition
though

you
had
the
same
problems
there
right

oh
yeah

sure

well
it
goes
back
to
that
again

if
you
look
at
prohibition
i
mean
because
it
's
illegal
it
costs
more

if
it
was
legal

i
mean
face
it
you
can
buy
pharmaceutical
grade
cocaine
for
what
ten
or
twenty
dollars
an
ounce

and
clearly
if
you
're
into
coke
and
all
you
want
to
do
is
you
know
snort
your
brains
out
all
day
long
if
it
was
legal
you
could
do
it
real
cheap

and
you
know
you
'd
be
a
menace
to
nobody
but
yourself
as
long
as
you
stayed
at
home
and
did
it

but
yeah

get
uh

oh
yeah

well
that
's
why
there
's
you
know
people
dealing
it
because
there
's
money
in
it
you
know

there
's
ridiculous
amounts
of
money

oh
yeah

interdiction
's
hopeless

i
mean

there
's
no
way
you
're
ever
going
to
win
that

the
tighter
you
squeeze
the
more
the
price
goes
up
the
more
incentive
there
is

i
mean
that
's
a
losing
fight

yeah

yeah

well
yeah

it
goes
back
to
you
know
what
right
what
can
society
impose
on
people

i
mean
can
you
force
somebody
to
be
a
good
productive
citizen

i
do
n't
think
you
can

i
mean
you
know
i
'm
you
know
was
raised
with
being
a
very
strong
bible
work
ethic

so
you
know
i
'm
one
of
these
you
know
ten
twelve
fifteen
twenty
hour
a
day
type
people

so
you
know
yeah

i
can
really
relate
to

yeah

everybody
ought
to
do
their
own
share

you
know
i
do
n't
have
any
you
know
love
lost
for
people
who
are
on
the
public
dole
just
because
they
're
too
lazy
to
get
a
job
or
that
kind
of
stuff

but
you
know

see
wh-
when
you
're
with
a
big
company
or
a
big
organization
a
lot
of
times
uh
you
know
the
benefits
are
good

and
and
you
know
the
pay
is
regular

but
uh
you
know
sometimes
you
do
n't
get
tuned
in
to
what
's
going
on

and
i
i
think
the
biggest
benefit
or
the
biggest
benefit
other
than
wages
that
that
uh
that
anybody
could
get
in
in
dealing
with
a
large
company
is
to
be
in
a
situation
where
you
you
get
to
know
what
's
going
on

and
maybe
that
's
that
's
probably
the
toughest
thing
in
the
whole
world
to
to
do

what
's
what
's
your
feeling
about
benefits

what
sort
of
benefits
would
you
like
to
get
from
a
big
company

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
th-

i
i
well
i
work
for
the
government

and
uh
actually
i
work
for
the
f
b
i

and
uh
and
so
you
know
we
we
do
n't
there
's
lots
of
things
that
we
do
n't
get
told
for
good
reason

but
uh
but
basically
uh
there
's
lots
of
things
that
that
we
should
know
about
projects

i
'm
an
engineer
you
know

i
'm
i
'm
a
cotr

and
sometim-

and
i
i
worked
in
the
same
lab
with
a
guy

and
we
did
n't
really
know
that
much
about
each
other
's
projects
for
two
years

and
we
should
have

you
know
we
're
we
're
now
collaborating

and

for
two
years
we
did
n't
and
we
which
was
a
kind
of
stupid

but
uh
but
our
organization
is
doing
something
else
t-
on
monday

uh
we
're
having
a
for
all
unclassified
programs
we
're
we
're
having
little
tables
put
up
in
front
of
lab
in
the
hallways

and
every
all
the
other
employees
are
going
to
come
around
and
see
what
sort
of
things
we
do
which
i
thought
was
kind
of
interesting
and
but
uh
but
that
that
sort
sort
of
thing

but
if
you
i
think
you
can
tolerate
a
lot
of
problems
if
you
understand
what
's
going
on

and
and
but
of
course
most
time
most
of
the
time
management
has
a
hard
time
distributing
or
getting
the
word
out
to
the
people
who
must
know

and
you
know
if
you
do
n't
really
count
if
you
're
not
part
of
the
program
you
might
not
get
told
for
months

or
you
might
you
know
if
it
does
n't
impact
you
directly
or
if
your
management
does
n't
think
that

but
but
regard
to
benefits
you
know
most
companies
have
most
big
organizations
have
decent
you
know
benefits
like
retirement
and
that
sort
of
thing

in
the
private
sector
i
would
think
that
one
of
the
major
uh
situations
especially
when
you
reach
you
know
the
the
mid-fifties
wa-
is
keeping
a
job
until
you
retire

and
engineers
are
uh
are
baggage
to
most
uh
uh
as
they
get
older
to
to
most
companies

and
uh
it
's
very
much
like
the
military

it
windows
out

you
know
you
you
think
well
boy
i
'm
getting
more
money

and
i
'm
getting
more
responsibility

i
'm
doing
this

but
as
you
climb
up
that
tree
pretty
soon
you
're
the
the
branches
get
smaller
on
the
top
of
the
tree

and
pretty
soon
somebody
falls
off

i
i
've
fallen
off
twice
in
the
private
sector

and
uh
and
you
know
i
can
get
up

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

he
may
be
retired

well
since
i
'm
kind
of
on
the
the
older
side
you
know
i
i
i
just
feel
like
uh
when
i
start
talking
about
benefits
i
talk
about
i
'm
concerned
about
medical
benefits

uh
my
uh
my
husband
works
for
mcdonald
douglas

and
so
his
benefits
his
medical
benefits
are
so
excellent
you
know

that
's
really
great

you
know
i
work
for
uh
wes-
a
bank
western
financial

and
uh
they
do
n't
let
me
know
really
about
anything
that
's
going
on

even
some
of
the
immediate
things
that
i
need
to
know
i
do
n't
know
it
until
the
next
hour

and
all
of
a
sudden
we
know
we
've
got
changes
made

we
're
changing
departments

we
're
changing
policies

we
're
changing
doing
other
kinds
of
things
which
to
me
is
is
disturbing

i
mean
i
feel
like
if
i
i
do
n't
necessarily
need
to
uh
be
involved
since
i
'm
pretty
much
on
a
low
level

you
are
you
are
right
there

you
know
i
'm
pretty
much
on
a
low
level
as
far
as
uh
the
company
is
concerned

but
i
i
do
kind
of
like
to
know
what
's
going
on
and
what
's
happening

and
i
think
i
can
be
a
better
and
more
effective
employee
if
if
i
had
a
little
bit
more
information
along
that
line

oh
my
gosh

uh-huh

oh

and
it
it

yeah

that
is
interesting

exactly

a-

right

uh-huh

oh

i
know

it
it
seems
to
be
be
kind
of
kind
of
scary
you
know
because
you
think
of

uh
see
my
son
's
eighteen
right
now

and
he
he
's
uh
he
wants
to
go
into
engineering

and
the
the
the
branches
of
engineering
that
he
wants
to
go
into
is
now
kind
of
open

and
he
's
interested
in
basically
three
different
areas

but
uh
it
's
difficult
for
me
to
try
to
give
him
any
kind
of
advice
or
to
advise
him
or
anything
like
that

he
needs
to
do
his
own
course
of
investigation
and
and
see
what
he
can
do
because
who
knows
what
's
going
to
happen
in
another
thirty
years

and
in
thirty
years
it
becomes
pretty
critical

i
mean
my
uh
brother-in-law
is
like
uh
i
mean
he
's
sixty

he
's
not
ready
to
retire

but
his
company
is
is
uh
is
uh
closing
up

and
because
of
the
defense
cutbacks
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff
and
all
the
nuclear
and
stuff
which
is
what
he
what
he
was
working
on
he
's
getting
cut
back

and
he
's
not
ready
to
retire

budgeting
activity
in
our
household
i
has
is
uh
uh
kind
of
an
informal
kind
of
situation

we
we
you
know
put

actually
what
happens
is
uh
is
my
check
gets
automatically
deposited

i
do
n't
even
have
the
glories
of
bringing
home
my
check
anymore

it
just
gets
deposited

and
and
and
my
my
wife
you
know
you
know
looks
at
all
those
bills
that
come
in

and
you
know
and
all
those
people
are
counting
on
me
to
have
my
wife
pay
them
you
see

and
so
our
our
budgeting

w-
we
really
do
n't
have
a
formal
budgeting
situation

every
time
i
've
ever
tried
one
it
's
uh
i
've
just
got
wrapped
in
my
inertia

and
uh
i
've
just
decided
not
to
pursue
it

uh
what
what
's
your
budget
situation

you
know
well
a-
a-
actually
that
kind
of
situation
is
just
wonderful
for
budgets
is
n't
it

uh-huh

well
my
you
know
my
my
parents
too

you
you
you
were
born
in
in
the
in
the
late
thirties
or
early
forties

yeah

um

uh-huh

well
that
that
's
good

well
we
we
buy
what
well

we
just
got
through
buying
a
twenty-five
foot
refrigerator
a
new
ceramic
top
stove
and
a
new
dishwasher

and
and
we
put
twenty-eight
hundred
dollars
on
the
charge
along
with
my
trip
to
japan
which
was
was
fourteen
or
fifteen
hundred
dollars

and
you
know

right

i
mean
we
just
we
got
a
monster
you
know
bill
coming
in

but
but
we
also
have
zero
in-
interest
being
paid

and
we
pay
it
off
as
as
it
goes

yeah

so
we
never
really
get
that
much
over
uh
over
extended

huh

yeah

we
're
we
're
doing
that

we
have
you
know
uh

th-
this
is
our
our
our
big
uh

we
did
redecorating

two
you
know
two
new
pieces
in
the
ref-
in
the
family
room
and
new
carpet

i
mean
we
just
uh
we
've
just
been
spending
spending
spending

bu-
but
we
have
n't
really
done
anything
for
a
long
time
because
we
've
we
've
had
two
kids
in
college
that
just
have
graduated
in
the
past
year

so
we
're
you
know
we
do
n't
have
that

yeah

it
's
uh
it
's
about
time
that
we
did
that

but
th-
the
the
terrible
part
about
it
i
've
looked
at
it
all

and
it
all
looks
still
pretty
good
to
me

why
why
we
need
to
replace
it

but
but
un-
unfortunately
my
my
my
wife
really
feels
as
though
it
's
it
's
just
been
an
inappropriate
uh
thing
to
to
i
mean

that
rug
is
thirteen
years
old

why
not
replace
it

i
mean
uh
i
say
it
might
go
for
another
thirteen

but
uh
too
late
we
'll
never
find
that
out

and

you
know
i
i
i
do
n't
spend
that
much
money

i
just
uh
we
just
sort
of
have
had
uh
you
know
too
many
obligations
to
you
know

we
sort
of
take
care
of
the
kids
when
they
were
school
and
they
they
got
through
school

and
that
was
the
major
you
know
decade
of
expenses
you
know

so
we
we
feel
as
uh

but
as
far
as
any
formal
budgeting
uh
you
know
i
i
we
just
apparently
have
been
very
fortunate

when
we
went
want
to
go
out
to
eat
we
go
out
to
eat

we
never
really
you
know
have
to
program
money
for
that
or
make
choices
you
know

but
uh
we
do
n't
have
that
uproarious
a
a
lifestyle

after
all
we
're

well
actually
uh
i
've
i
've
had
a
couple
of
different
situations

my
current
one
has
been
the
most
successful

uh
at
a
certain
point
in
life

an-
my
husband
my
ex-husband
was
an
alcoholic

and
we
got
divorced
back
in
the
mid-seventies

and
that
left
me
with
three
teenagers

it
certainly
is

but
at
any
rate
what
happened
was
that
i
i
just
absolutely
put
away
all
the
credit
cards

i
did
n't
rip
them
up

i
did
n't
send
them
back

nothing

i
just
put
them
away

because
there
was
one
that
it
was
really
handy
to
have

if
i
absolutely
had
to
have
something
i
could
go
use
it

but
uh
mostly
we
just
spent
cash
whatever
we
had

and
if
we
did
n't
have
it
we
absolutely
did
n't
spend
it

but
then
as
things
improved
you
know

once
once
i
got
them
all
through
college
uh
it
came
to
the
point
where
uh

my
parents
came
through
the
depression

i
'm
not
sure
how
old
you
are

but
my

late
thirties

yeah

uh-huh

and
uh
my
mother
hardly
ever
spent
anything
on
herself
or
on
the
house

and
that
's
kind
of
the
way
i
was
raised

and
so
i
'm
not
a
very
demanding
person
in
in
that
aspect

so
for
quite
a
period
of
time
i
just
flat
did
n't
spend
any
money

now
meanwhile
i
got
had
a
a
building
bank
balance

and
my
intent
was
that
whenever
something
went
on
sale
that
i
really
had
to
have
i
would
have
the
cash
to
buy
it
right
then
and
there
and
not
ever
have
to
spend
any
money
on
interest

and
that
that
's
the
way
i
've
operated
ever
since
then

it

and
you
know
if
if
something
goes
on
sale
and
i
do
n't
have
the
money
i
still
do
n't
buy
it

oh
my

oh
my

oh
my

uh-huh

and
that
's
the
way
i
do
my
credit
cards
now

yeah

i
do
almost
all
my
purchasing
on
credit
cards

but
it
's
the
fact
that
i
have
enough
of
a
of
a
cushion
in
the
bank
so
that
when
they
come
i
can
pay
them
in
full

oh
my

i
'm
envious

well
i

uh-huh

it
's
time
for
you
to
do
these
things
then
right

this
is
so
funny

that
's
wonderful

but
you
're
lucky
to
have
her
because
if
you
're
like
me
and
you
have
difficulty
spending
money
you
need
somebody
to
help
you
spend
it

i
mean
certain
things
really
do
need
to
be
done
whether
or
not
you
think
they
should
be
or
not

uh
well
you
know
uh
i
think
public
service
is
a
worthy
thing

and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
a
lot
of
programs
uh
such
as
peace
corps
that
promote
that

probably
the
most
popular
one
but
uh
one
that
is
not
typically
recognized
as
such
is
the
boy
scouts

uh
i
know
that
f-
because
my
son
is
a
a
scout
now
and
uh
is
thinking
about
his
eagle

and
uh
in
order
to
get
eagle
you
have
to
have
merit
badges
in
uh
citizenship
in
the
community
citizenship
in
the
nation
citizenship
in
the
world

and
you
have
to
do
a
public
service
project
uh
in
which
leadership
is
the
key
element

i
uh
i
think
the
question
is
posed
somewhat
strangely
because
uh
it
's
talking
about
a
requirement
for
public
service

and
of
course
pe-
the
peace
corps
the
boy
scouts
is
a
o-
is
a
voluntary
activity

uh

right

of
course
uh
uh
military
service
falls
under
the
category
uh
of
a
public
service

and
so
uh
one
of
the
things
that
would
fulfill
the
at
least
the
nominal
uh
qualifications
set
forth
in
the
charge
is
military
service
or
draft

uh

but
i
agree
with
you
that
probably
is
not
what
was
comprehended

there
are
other
things
such
as
civil
service
uh
which
many
people
uh
are
lifelong
employees
of

but
i
suspect
that
was
not
what
they
had
in
mind
either

more
of
a
voluntary
kind
of
thing

or
uh

uh-huh

why

why
is
that

oh
no

no

no

it
's
to
defend
the
nation
against
external
evils

well
it
depends
on
whether
you
whether
we
figure
that
we
have
that
we
have
a
defense
oriented
military
or
an
aggressive
aggression
oriented
military

okay

go
ahead

uh-huh

huh

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

i
i
think
that
might
be
talking
referring
to
uh
something
kind
of
uh
alternative
to
the
draft
you
know

either
you
have
uh
military
service
or
some
sort
of
alternative
nonmilitary
service
for
a
few
years

right

right

huh
right

right

well
i-

uh-huh

right

yeah

yeah

yeah

i-
i-

for
for
years
there
has
been
an
idea
batted
around
of
having
some
sort
of
alternative
uh
public
service
for
uh
young
people
to
go
into
uh
after
high
school

uh
kind
of
in
lieu
of
the
draft
for
for
people
who
do
n't
uh
who
you
know
are
conscientious
objectors
or
do
n't
otherwise
want
e-
e-
to
be
in
the
military
you
know

say
okay

well
you
can
go
into
the
military

or
you
can
do
this
other
thing
for
one
or
two
years
to
kind
of
serve
the
community
and
and
learn
about
things

and
i-
it
's
interesting
because
i
i
'm
not
a
particular
fan
of
the
military

but
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
people
a
lot
of
young
guys
go
in
that
do
n't
have
really
a
clue
as
to
what
they
want
to
do
with
their
lives
and
are
n't
terribly
disciplined
you
know
even
just
personal
discipline
about
what
they
want
to
do

and
they
come
out

and
they
they
at
least
have
now
they
have
at
least
some
marginally
marketable
skills
and
more
discipline

and
they
have
uh
you
know
in
in
some
cases
they
have
a
greater
self-esteem
because
they
can
say
they
can
see
that
you
know
if
i
do
something
or
sub-
submit
my
own
will
to
the
will
of
the
sargent
or
whatever
at
least
for
a
short
period
of
time
i
can
accomplish
a
lot

and
it
it
's
a
good
lesson
for
a
lot
of
young
men
to
learn
that
they
do
n't
need
to
be
you
know
cowboys

they
do
n't
need
to
be
out
there
and
uh
you
know
constantly
flaunting
their
ego
to
get
things
accomplished

and
you
know
for
some
for
some
young
men
that
's
good

for
me
it
would
have
been
lousy
i-
idea
uh
because
i
i
did
have
th-
the
personal
discipline

and
i
went
to
college
for
four
years
and
got
out
you
know

so
but
uh
you
know
for
some
people
that
's
good

i
i
do
n't
particular
like
the
fact
that
it
's
the
military
you
know

and
the
whole
point
of
the
military
is
to
kill
people
essentially
as
as
an
instrument
of
u
s
policy

well
that
's
one
view

and
and
you
know
and
that
that
's
another
debate

but
uh
it
's
uh

uh-huh

right

right

and
well
it
's
it
it
seems
pretty
aggre-
aggressive
oriented

i
mean
you
you
look
at
the
last
mis-
military
action
which
was
in
the
persian
gulf
and
was
n't
anywhere
near
the
united
states

and
it
was
uh
you
know
it
was
definitely
a
projection
of
u
s
power
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe

so
at
at
any
rate
this
is
getting
off
the
topic

but
i-

my
my
point
was
that
there
is
for
people
who
do
n't
want
to
do
the
military
service
there
it
would
be
neat
if
there
were
an
alternative
that
could
instill
the
same
sort
of
personal
discipline
and
sense
of
purpose
and
uh
sense
of
community
that
the
boy
scouts

actually
i
've
been
involved
in
electronics
a
long
time
uh
in
computers

and
i
have
really
resisted
the
impulse
to
get
one
for
the
home
uh
up
until
i
guess
maybe
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago

i
got
one
for
my
son
a
a
macintosh
uh
l
c

it
's
a
real
easy
to
use
color
uh
computer

and
i
got
a
very
nice
printer
that
goes
along
with
it

and
he
uses
it
for
his
school
work

huh

where
you
going
to
school

i
see

in
engineering

so
that
explains
wha-
all
the
uh
computer
assignments

well
do
you
use
your
p
c
for
things
other
than
explicit
computer
work

no

no

i
just
have
one
for
my
son

and
i
really
sort
of
have
the
feeling
that
word
processing
is
a
big
market
for
home
computing

at
wo-
at
work
uh
i
'm
a
technologist
uh

and
i
in
the
past
have
done
a
great
deal
of
of
uh
system
development
just
through
uh
software
development
programming

uh
but
now
i
find
myself
using
the
computer

even
the
computer
at
work
is
primarily
a
uh
word
processing
system
and
a
communication
system

yes

emil
is
probably
pulls
down
a
third
a-
of
all
my
time

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh
well
i
'm
a
old-timer

i
did
my
master
's
thesis
on
uh
a
typewriter

uh
i
rented
an
i
b
m
selectric

and
it
was
a
pretty
big
deal

yeah

it
uh
well
you
know
it
's
just
it
was
just
a
completely
different
world
then

i
like
it

yeah

i
like
it
from
a
distance
really

i
i
see
the
packages
on
it
uh
that
are
available

and
it
's
nice

i
really
do
n't
use
it
myself

uh
i
when
i
come
home
from
work
i
i
like
to
stay
far
away
from
computers
and
electronic
things

uh
so
i
let
my
son
do
it

and
uh
of
course
you
know
there
's
uh
there
's
an
intellectual
evolution
taking
place
where

it
's
sort
of
a
joke

but
it
's
really
true

the
old-timers
even
the
people
who
are
technologists
do
n't
know
how
to
operate
these
electronic
things
like
v
c
r
-s
and
whatnot

and
the
kids
they
just
take
to
it
like
candy

oh
yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
i
've
i
'm
currently
in
school

so
i
i
've
had
an
i
b
m
clone
i
guess
for
a
couple
of
years
now
which
i
've
been
trying
continually
upgrading
i
guess

and
uh
i
've
found
i
've
found
that
i
pretty
much
become
addicted
to
it

and
i
ca
n't
really

i
've
found
that
most
of
homework
assignments
really
require
some
sort
of
computer
uh
simulation
or
analysis

so

it
it
's
pr-
very
essential
for
me

schools
have
them

uh
but
lot
of
times
so
difficult
to
get
on
them
at
school

it
's
very
easy
it
's
much
more
convenient
to
have
one
at
home

at
georgia
tech

yeah

so

yes
actually

yeah

it
uh

um
sure

i
have
some
games
of
course
which
i
play
on
there

and
uh
uh
i
have
a
program
which
allows
me
to
access
a
uh
weather
data
bank

so
i
can
like
check
up
on
the
weather
around
the
country
or
whatever
which
is
a
hobby

so
it
provides
other
means
other
than
just
strict
uh
you
know
computations
and
so
on

so
have
you
do
you
have
a
computer
for
yourself
at
home

oh
yeah

yeah

tha-

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

do
you
use
email
and
like
that

yeah

it
's

i
i
uh
i
have
modem
night
computer

so
i
can
log
into
the
sys-
the
uh
network
at
georgia
tech
and
access
my
account
through
there
which
is
which
can
be
useful

but
uh
yeah

that
's
that
and
word
processing
is

while
i
tend
to

i
mean
obviously
i
do
most
of
my
almost
all
of
my
report
writing
on
on
my
computer
uh
whether
it
's
term
papers
or
even
some
smaller
homework
assignments

so
it
's
it
's
really
become
i
do
n't
know
really
become
my
mainstay
i
guess

i
ca
n't
even
remember

actually
i
do
n't
think
i
've
ever
used
a
typewriter
in
in
my
life
to
do
a
a
to
do
a
report
because
my
family
when
i
was
growing
up
we
got
a
basic
computer
t
r
s
eighty
when
they
first
came
out

and
i
even
used
that
to
do
my
first
reports
when
i
was
in
junior
high

so

oh
yeah

oh

yeah

it
must
have
been
tough

it
's
a
little
bit
strange
for
me

i
i
did
my
master
's
thesis
uh
last
year

and
i
did
that
on
a
computer

and
it
seems
like

i
just
ca
n't
imagine
how
people
did
it
before

it
must
have
been
just
so
much
so
much
work

yeah

so
uh
so
yo-
you
used
your
son
's
macintosh
then

do
you
do
you
find
it
do
you
like
that
kind
of
computer

uh-huh

yeah

huh

yeah

yeah

well
i-
if
if
if
the
interface
is
there
so
that
it
's
like
fun
to
use
and
the
challenge

regarding
uh
taxes
i
you
know

taxes
are
really
a
necessary
evil
and
in
a
civilized
society

but
really
people
get
upset
at
taxes
because
you
it
's
more
efficient
to
do
things
yourself

and
uh
and
so
as
as
a
result
uh
you
know
it
's
it
's
a
trade-off
you
know
for
the
common
good
you
know
for
for
the
benefit
of
others
you
know

how
much
of
your
resource
should
you
dedicate
to
uh
making
things
work
for
others

have
you
uh
you
know
ever
thought
you
know
just
how
much
of
that
money
should
should
go
to
other
people
that
really
do
n't
deserve
it

well
the
thing
of
it
is
if
i
wanted
to
just
uh
you
know
permanently
become
a
book
reader
i
guess
i
could
just
uh
you
know
uh
go
on
public
assistance
uh
you
know
lo-
lo-
look
for
uh
look
for
people
to
uh
take
care
of
me

and
uh
probably
a
good
woman

right

just
you
know
just
just
con
somebody
to
take
care
of
me

and
then
you
do
n't
have
to
be
on
the
tax
roll

but
uh
but
taxes
are
are
very
difficult
kind
of
thing

and
everybody
really
hates
it

it
was
very
timely

i
i
i
always
over
pay
my
my
deductions

so
i
wind
up
with
my
getting
money
back
on
my
uh
from
my
uh
withholding

so
uh
you
know
that
that
's
always
a
smile

but
of
course
you
know
i
've
i
've
paid
it
in

and
i
should
calculate
it
better

no

i
i
i
work
for
the
f
b
i

so
i
i
'm
a
federal
employee

yeah

guess
i
do
n't
sound
like
it
huh

yeah

i
belong

oh
i
i
've
got
all
four
feet
in
the
trough
you
know
being
a
federal
employee

and
and
so
but
but
i
can
understand
that
uh
that
you
know
the
uh
who
gets
benefits

like
every
every
time
there
is
a
a
bond
issue
you
know
i
vote
no
on
every
one
of
them

i
'm
i

but
there

this
is
this
is
tax
not
tax
revolt
country

i
mean
there
's
too
many

every
one
of
us
most
of
us
have
our
have
all
four
feet
in
the
trough
you
know
plus
our
snout
right
up
to
our
ears

so
you
know
it
's
not
exactly
that
kind
of
a
place
that
that
you
want
to
you
know
get
into
a
tax
revolt
situation

but
uh
uh
the
uh
the
local
taxes
here
i
i

i-
in
this
particular
area
uh
you
know
i
've
uh
i
think
i
pay
about
uh
oh
thirty-five
hundred
for
for
taxes
on
my
four
bedroom
house
you
know
and
which
is
a
lot
of
money

an-
and
uh
and
so
as
as
people
get
older
and
older
uh
you
know
they
think
about
retirement
and
that
sort
of
thing

and
and
they
they
're
building
old
peoples
homes
uh
you
know
at
tax
expense

well
i
think
you
know
the
old
people
ought
to
just
bail
out
of
here
and
go
where
it
's
cheaper

at
thirty-three
hundred
dollars
or
thirty-five
hundred
dollars
i
'm
paying
in
taxes

why
i
i
could
go
down
to
bulverde
and
probably
rent
a
rent
a
house
for
that

right

you
know
in
in
instead
it
's
it
's
the
taxes
here

so

course
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
want
to
go
to
bulverde
or
not
you
know
or
seguin
or
someplace
like
that

but
uh
there
's
certainly
lots
of
inexpensive
places
where
the
services
are
poorer

and
and
i
think
really
the
only
place
you
can
really
reduce
the
amount
of
taxes
you
pay
is
to
move
to
an
area
where
the
services
are
poorer

if
you
're
not
going
to
use
them
then
you
want
to
be
in
in
environment

that
's
a
strategy
i
think
tha-
that
the
people
have
to
have
to
take
is
is
how
to
be
able
to
to
lessen
their
cost
of
living
you
know

i
'm
i
'm
five
or
six
years
before
i
'm
eligible
to
retire

and
and
i
'm
saying
well
you
know
i
really
ca
n't
stay
here
uh
as
a
retiree

it
's
too
expensive

i
'm
going
to
have
go
out
and
you
know
in
you
know
east
fork
someplace
and
and
do
my
thing
you
know

right

they
they
redecorated
in
nineteen
seventy-five
you
know

and
they
're
not
doing
it
a-
again
you
know

so
well
it
's
certainly
uh
uh

you
must
be
a
t
i
employee

you
must
be
a
t
i
employee

you
're
not
a
t
i

who
do
you
work
for

you
you
're

right

uh
well
yeah

i
know
it
's
it
's
a
lot
you
know
that
uh
that
i
feel
like
you
know
just
like
you
said
that
there
's
just
so
much
that
you
can
do
yourself
that
you
take
care
of
your
own
self
that
you
do
n't
need
the
money
for

but
they
're
giving
it
to
other
people
that
do
n't
really
need
it
ei-
either

but
yet
they
accept
it

like
so
many
people
do

uh-huh

right

right

uh-huh

right

you
are
you
in
business
for
yourself

right

uh
well
i
th-

no

i
think
that
people
that
work
for
the
government
are
just
as
against
taxes
as
as
everybody
else
you
know
unless
you
work
for
internal
revenue

yeah

uh-huh

right

yeah

right

right

uh-huh

yeah

that
's
right

yeah

yeah

yeah

after
you
retire

yeah

yeah

right

my
parents
are
in
the
same
situation
you
know

they
their
home
is
paid
for

but
still
their
taxes
are
so
high
that
you
know
my
father
does
n't
feel
like
he
can
retire
because
they
could
n't
pay
their
taxes

and
they
have
no
children
in
school
or
you
know
anything
now

they
do
n't
use
any
of
those
services
that
a
lot
of
the
taxes
go
towards

uh
yeah

yeah

you
must
be
what

no

i
'm
not

i
i
do
n't
work

i
'm
a
student

i
go
to
school

i
'm
in
nursing
school

okay

uh
generally
i
get
uh
you
know
most
of
my
news
uh
in
the
you
know
weekly
magazines
like
time
newsweek
and
and
uh
u
s
news
and
world
report
with
with
occasional
smatterings
of
of
uh
you
know
the
wall
street
journal
and
of
course
the
local
paper

but
uh
my
my
only
complaint
is
i
really
do
n't
enough
time
to
to
look
at
the
articles
every
day
and
and
go
through
a
paper
you
know
exhaust
the
details

so
that
's
why
i
concentrate
on
weekly
magazines

well
yes

i
i
well
i
i
do
n't
think
i
have
the
time
to
really
become
a
student
in
every
article

and
and
so
i
i
i
like
the
weekly
magazines
uh
because
i-
it
gives
me
you
know
the
high
points
of
what
's
going
on

uh
but
many
times
uh
you
know
the
the
local
uh
the
local
news
kind
of
suffers
you
know

but
here
i
am
you
know
cheek
by
jowl
with
our
nation
's
capital

and

yeah

yes

e-
exactly

well
when
when
the
capital
gang
always
talk
about
the
people
inside
the
beltway
i
'm
saying
to
myself
hey
guys
i
'm
inside
the
beltway

but
uh
i-
it
turns
out
that
uh
that
that
the
c
n
n
is
i
think
is
great
and
for
for
things
like
hurricanes
and
fast
breaking
events

but
generally
they
're
they
're
they
're
more
sound
bitish
you
know
kind
of
thing

and
and
i
do
n't
really
uh
you
know
i
do
n't
really
feel
as
though
i
've
a
gotten
sufficient
uh
you
know
dose
of
news
that
way

uh-huh

yes

well
the
mercury
and
the
and
the
and
the
chronicle
are
the
only
things
that
are
really
can
stand
up
there

uh
redwood
city

i
use
to
work
at
anteks

anteks
amdahl
and
places
like
that

yeah

uh-huh

yes

i
i
've
i
enjoy

see
they
have
uh
we
have
two
the
both
c
spans
here

but
but
really
the
th-
on
the
public
t
v
you
know
macneil
lehrer
is
one
is
an
hour
's
program
that
i
always

if
if
i
watch
any
news
program
it
will
be
macneil
lehrer
and
and
occasionally
c
span

i
i
like
a
i
saw
the
uh
the
uh
the
the
tapes
that
were
that
were
run
of
marion
berry
's
drug
bust

was
the
whole
thing
was
was
run
on
that

and
and
and
a-
also
they
have
the
uh
the
uh
uh
parliament
's
question
and
answer
period

it

when
wh-
when
it
first
uh
you
know
when
it
first
tuned
in
on
that
i
you
know

it
's
one
that
's

i
think
it
was
somebody
was
just
scarcely
just
just
ripping
the
hell
out
of
someo-
another
person

and
i

and
everybody
was
you
know
making
noise
in
the
background

and
then
yeah

here
's
this
dude
in
a
wig

and
i
said
to
myself
it
's
another
monty
python
that
i
did
n't
know
about

and
then
and
then
up
jumps
margaret
thatcher
off
her
green
bench

and
i
said
oh
it
's
parliament

yeah

so
i
i
thought
to
myself
i
ca
n't
wait

i
'm
going
over
to
to
britain
in
mid
you
know
in
mid-may

i
i
i
'm
going
to
uh
you
know
a-
you
know
apr-
approach
my
uh
you
know

this
is
how
i
discovered
you
know
the
que-
the
prime
minister
's
you
know
question
and
answer
period
you
know

p-

yeah

uh-huh

do
you
think
that
the
weekly
magazines
provide
you
with
as
much
detail
information
as
you
'd
like

uh-huh

uh-huh

oh
that
's
right

you
're
very
close
actually

it
's
almost
a
uh
bedroom
community
for
the
capital

uh-huh

yeah

a
lot
of
my
information
comes
from
several
sources

probably
pretty
high
up
on
the
list
is
national
public
radio
uh
which
i
like

uh
i
i
think
it
's
fairly
objective

and
i
always
like
the
letters
that
they
read
which
tend
to
accuse
them
of
being
too
liberal
and
too
conservative

and
while
there
's
an
inherent
uh
filtering
process
going
on
just
by
the
letters
they
choose
to
read
uh
i
always
figure
it
's
a
good
thing
when
any
given
group
is
being
accused
by
each
side
of
uh
favoring
the
other
side

that
's
that
's
potential
indication
of
balance

and
generally
i
really
do
believe
they
are
pretty
balanced

uh
i
also
read
time
magazine

and
we
get
one
of
the
daily
newspapers
around
here
where
we
go
through
various
sections
of
the
uh
various
uh
of
the
articles
and
the
front
section

and
uh

oh

oh
you
st-

did
you
use
to
live
around
here

oh
okay

oh
yeah

okay

i
know
exactly
where
that
is

yeah

we
we
get
the
mercury
which
i
generally
think
is
actually
a
pretty
good
newspaper

a-

the
newspaper
i
really
been
impressed
with
it
when
i
've
read
it
at
times
i-
at
well
the
los
angeles
times
which
i
've
found
to
be
a
uh
a
very
good
quality
uh
newspaper

and
i
like
a
lot
of
the
articles
there

th-
the
other
thing
when
you
said
we
do
n't
have
cable
t
v
so
but
the
other
thing
that
you
referred
to
that
always
sounds
really
interesting
to
me
is
is
called
c
span

both

uh-huh

uh-huh

oh
i
never
say
that

that
would
have
been
interesting

yeah

i
i
think
that
's
always
fascinating

i
wish
i
wish
we
had
something

but
it
's
usually
the
prime
minister

right

thatcher

major

which
could
be
another
of
monty
python

i
i
have
seen
that

and
uh
a
aside
from
the
level
of
wit
which
is
much
higher
than
generally
in
american
politics
uh
which
i
really
enjoy
i
really
like
the
fact
that
they
have
a
chance
to
ask
hard
real
questions
i
think

and
it
's
unlike
the
fairly
controlled
uh
press
conferences
that
presidents
of
the
united
states
have
here
where
they
they
always
seem

well
actually
uh

i
i
do
n't
think
i
'm
in
the
uh
majority
of
in
in
texas

i
do
n't
think
i
agree
with

no

uh
i
would
n't
say
that

i
think
i
would
have
said
that
a
few
years
ago

when
i
was
younger
i
thought
it
was
uh
a
sign
of
a
civilized
society
if
you
did
n't
have
uh
capital
punishment

but
um
uh
maybe
slowly
changing
my
opinion

i
'm
not
thoroughly
opposed
to
it

i
still
think
it
's
sort
of
true
that
a
more
civilized
society
would
n't
have
to
use
capital
punishment

but
i
'm
beginning
to
believe
this
is
less
civilized
society
than
i
thought

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

i
certainly
do
n't
uh
advocate
turning
people
like
that
loose

i
'm
not
sure
executing
them
uh
does
anymore
than
keeping
them
in
jail

but
uh

yeah

that
that
's
a
factor

right

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

yeah

well
i

the
cost
is
something

but
it
's
but
i
think
it
's
relatively
unimportant
compared
to
what
's
the
most
effective
way
of
dealing
with
crime

and
i
guess
i
would
like

i
do
n't
know

the
european
countries
certainly
uh
none
of
them
have
capital
punishment

and
they
they
do
n't
have
a
crime
problem
either

no

you
ca
n't

they
do
n't
execute
anybody
in
britain
or
france

and
i
do
n't
believe
they
do
in
germany
or
italy
either

and
they
do
n't
have
the
crime
problems
we
do

i
do
n't
really
think
that
there
is
too
much
of
a
relationship
between
the
two

i
guess
what
worries
me
about
capital
punishment
is
uh
when
i
see
people
enthusiastic
about
it
and
uh
uh
sort
of
bloodthirsty
i
think
it
brings
out
the
worst
in
the
in
the
people
who
do
the
punishing

and
the
that
that
bothers
me

but
it

but
uh

huh

yeah

huh

well
actually
i
wha-

the
other
thing
that
bothers
me
is
when
it
becomes
a
political
issue
because
i
do
n't
really
think
it
uh
i
do
n't
really
think
it
's
a
very
important
aspect
of
fighting
crime
or
law
and
order
or
anything
else

i
think
it
just
becomes
a
uh
symbolic
i
'm
tougher
than
you
are
type
of
emotional
issue
for
politicians

so

i
would
like
for
it
to
be
settled
once
for
all
and
uh
get
in
the
background
while
the
more
important
issues
get
discussed
uh
uh

like
i
said
some
years
ago
i
think
i
would
have
said
there
's
no
place
for
capital
punishment
in
the
civilized
western
country

now
i
'm
i
'm
not
so
sure
of
that

i
'm
i
i
would
n't
vote
against
somebody
just
because
it
was
for
capital
punishment
and
nor
the
other
way
around

uh
i
guess
i
'm
i
'm

my
view
of
uh

my

i
'm
beginning
to
believe
that
some
people
are
simply
not
rehabilitatable
and
uh
that
uh
uh
costs
and
other
factors
justify
uh
uh
executing
people

maybe
it
's
more
a
symbolic
gesture
that
uh
uh
than
anything
else

and
uh
i
've
also
never
been
a
victim
although
i
have
some
i
have
two
friends
whose
wives
were
murdered

and
uh
i
can
imagine
that
uh
uh
for
some
people
it
would
be
the
only
form
of
justice
in
that
case

oh
really

you
do
n't
believe
in
it

yeah

you
sound
a
lot
like
a
friend
of
mine
a
a
girl
i
hang
out
with

she
has
very
very
black
and
white
opinions
you
know

there
's
no
gray
in
her
opinions
you
know

she
she
probably
would
agree
more
with
you

but
but
i
do
n't
know

i
think
i
would
rather
a
person
go
ahead
and
be
put
down
than
give
them
the
opportunity
to
get
out
and
do
it
again

i
've
never
had
a
a
punishment
or
a
a
crime
like
a
murder
touch
my
immediate
family

but
i
still
feel
very
strongly
that
capital
punishment
is
a
good
way
to
to
punish
especially
criminals
who
seem
to
have
absolutely
no
remorse
for
what
they
've
done

and
we
see
that
more
and
more

like
in
our
state
right
now
there
's
a
fourteen
year
old
boy
who
raped
and
then
killed
a
seven
year
old
girl

you
know
that
's
fourteen
years
old

what
's
he
going
to
be
doing
when
he
turns
into
an
adult

yeah

no

it
does
n't

but
it
costs
less

and
yeah

to
me
it
is

i
mean
i
work
and
i
pay
my
taxes

and
i
lived
out
in
texas
for
a
little
while

and
they
're

and
that
's
a
pretty
heavy
state
compared
to
georgia

i
mean
you
guys
are
are
a
lot
more
uh
for
to
each
his
own
even
than
we
are
in
georgia

but
even
in
georgia
that
's
the
attitude
for
the
most
part

if
i
work
and
pay
my
dues
you
work
and
pay
your
dues
and
we
'd
get
along
just
fine

but
when
i
've
got
to
work
to
pay
my
dues
and
your
dues
then
i
do
n't
like
you
very
much
anymore

oh
really

yeah

you
might
be
right

i
mean
i
i
'd
hate
to
be
the
person
to
pull
the
switch
you
know

i
would
never
in
a
million
years
want
that
job

but
i
do
believe
it
's
necessary

and
i

on
the
one
hand
i
i
guess
i
admire
the
person
who
has
the
guts
to
do
it
because
i
could
n't
i
could
n't
stand
behind
a
gun
and
shoot
somebody
for
nothing

and
i
could
n't
pull
the
switch

but
uh

yeah

right

uh-huh

what
what
's
making
you
become
more
convinced
that
it
might
be
a
good
way
of
punishing

yeah

oh
gosh

oh
yes

if
it
ever
touched
my
fam-

uh
i
have
a
ford
pickup

and
uh
the
family
car
is
a
uh
a
dodge
caravan
and
uh
because
we
have
three
kids
and
they
're
under
thirteen

so
uh

they
sort
of
fit
our
requirement

yeah

i
have
a
one
of
those
uh
pickups
with
the
uh
seat
with
a
seat
in
the
back

and
so
they
just
fit
in
there

when
they
get
to
be
teenagers
with
long
legs
it
may
not
work

right
now
i
can
right
now
i
can
throw
them
all
in
the
back
when
we
have
room

and
uh
and
since
i
do
a
lot
of
projects
i
throw
things
in
the
back

and
i
kind
of
like
having
a
pickup
truck

actually
i
think
of
it
as
a
as
a
car
that
'll
last

i
like
the
way
trucks
are
built

and
i
do
n't
care
about
comfort

so
i
'm
pretty
happy

so
i
would
n't
hesitate
to
get
another
one

i
i
never
buy
new

so
i
would
n't
hesitate
to
get
another
used
truck

and
uh
yeah

i
do
n't
i
do
n't
need
to
pay
for
the
glitz

i
'll
let
somebody
else
uh
have
the
showroom
shine

and
i
'll
pay
for
the
rest
of
it

right

and
uh
the
van
we
're
sor-

we
might
go
again
on
a
on
a
van

we
we
could
probably
do
with
a
a
something
just
a
little
bit
larger
than
a
compact
in
a
sedan
next
time

i
'm
not
sure

we
have
to
we
we
'll
have
to
face
it
in
a
couple
of
years

but
uh
i
i
guess
we
had
a
small
toyota
wagon

and
we
were
real
happy
with
that
because
uh
my
my
second
requirement
after
price
is
uh
low
maintenance

and
uh
th-
it
certainly
had
that

we
did
n't
do
much
to
it
at
all

so

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-oh

how

at
how
at
how
many
miles

huh

you
did
n't
overheat
it

uh-huh

huh

well
that
was

uh-huh

yeah

i
have
one
colleague
that
uh
commutes
to
work
on
one
when
it
's
not
raining

and
uh
uh
he
's
a

it
's

he
's
pretty
conservative
guy

i
do
n't
think
it
's
much
of
a
sport
for
him
i
guess
uh

i
'm
sure
he
does

yeah

no

yeah

uh

yeah

right

if
i
only
had
some
place
that
i
could
store
the
uh
camper
top
i
would
have
it
off
most
of
the
time

i
really
leave
it
on
there
just
for
just
to
have
it
out
of
the
way
because
you
put
it
on
the
ground
it
gets
dirty

but
uh
they
're
solid

uh
trucks
are
built
uh
i
mean

they
're
the
only
things
americans
still
know
how
to
build

and
uh

yeah

right

i
i
kind
of
like
mine

yeah

so
mine
's
a
ford

oh
i
heard
about
that

yes

yeah

that
that
's
a
serious
truck

right

this
uh

i
i
know
a
contractor
who
just
got
one
of
those

he
's
pleased
with
it

i
do
n't
know
what
you
drive
now

i
mean
what
do
you
drive
now

oh
okay

throw
them
in
the
back

cab

oh
yeah

yeah

there
you
go

yeah

yo-

right

yeah

i
know

yeah

you
're
looking
at

i
got
a
toyota
four
runner

i
wanted
a
truck
that
i
i
wanted
something
that
i
could
throw
people
in
the
back
too

so
i
got
a
four
runner

you
're
just
like
me

i
've
never
bought
a
new
vehicle
in
my
life

no

let
somebody
else
break
it
in

right

yeah

right

right

yeah

yeah

my
my

pretty
much
the
same

i
i
got
a
like
i
say
i
got
one
of
those
toyota
four
runners

and
uh
it
pretty
much
does
everything
i
need
it
to

i
mean
it
it
'll
tow
three
thousand
pounds

so
i
can
tow
everything

and
it

i
can
throw

i
've
had
eleven
people
in
it
before
believe
it
or
not

and
uh
it
's
real
reliable

belie-

i
i
mean
i
've
had
it
for
almost
four
years
now

and
up
until
oh
say
two
weeks
ago
it
had
never
had
anything
wrong
with
it

and
then
of
course
two
weeks
ago
it
decided

i
do
n't
know

it
's
the
strangest
weirdest
thing
in
the
world

but
it
blew
a
head
gasket

did
n't
do
any
damage
to
it

uh
i
caught
it
real
early

uh
oh
ninety-seven
thousand

so
it
's
not
real
early

no

never
overheated
it

i
smell
i
smelled
the
uh
i
smelled
the
coolant

went
out
and
looked

saw
it
was
saw
where
it
was
coming
from

drove
it
right
to
the
shop
and
left
it
off

and
that
was
it

because
i
d-
i
have
that

and
then
i
have
a
a
kawasaki
motorcycle
which
is
actually
the
usually
my
preferred
mode
of
transportation
if
i
can
take
it
and
it
's
not
raining

i
mean
that
's
that
's
sort
of
my
hobby
though
more
than
a
vehicle

it
it
's
a

i
do
n't
know

people
who
buy
motorcycles
for
transportation
i
think
are
kidding
themselves

i
know

but
i
bet
you
he
really
enjoys
riding
it

yeah

so
you
know
yo-

h-

when
was
the
last
time
you
took
out
took
your
truck
out
just
to
just
to
go
driving

yeah

and
i
go
out
twice
a
week
on
the
bike
so
at
least
just
for
the
enjoyment

but
yeah

i
i
mean
the
only
thing
i
think
i
might
get
a
new
car
or
not
necessarily
a
new
car
but
a
another
car

uh
i
would
consider
going
to
a
a
non
to
a
normal
pickup
rather
than
a
a
covered
pickup
like
the
one
i
've
got
just
because
there
's
a
lot
of
times
i
wished
i
had
ju-
just
an
open
bed
to
throw
stuff
in

i
'm
sure
i
'm
sure
that
that
's
very

i
mean
you
got
one

it
's
that
's
really
convenient
to
be
able
to
throw
that
sort
of
stuff
in
the
back

and

right

to
have
it
out
of
the
way

right

i
think
they
last
a
lot
longer
than
anything
else

yeah

yeah

the
trucks
do

uh
even
though
you
know
the
jap
the
little
jap
trucks
are
are
good
there
too

but
so
are
the

though
i
think
the
chevies

i
do
n't
think
the
che-

i
do
n't
like
the
chevies
as
much
as
i
like
the
fords

i
think
they
i
think
the
fords
tend
to
last
a
little
longer
at
least
until
recently

a
friend
of
mine
just
bought
bought
like
a
year
ago
it
it
's
a
really
nice
truck

i
mean
i
do
n't
like
dodges
at
all

but
one
of
the
dodges
they
have
out
now
has
a
uh
the
cummins
turbo
diesel
on
it

oh
it
's
beautiful

that
thing
that
thing
will
last
forever
i
mean

oh
yeah

that
thing
's
uh

it
's
got
a
boat
engine
in
it

uh-huh

well
i
have
n't
had
an
awful
lot
of
uh
incidents
regarding
child
care

when
my
two
year
old
was
in
new
orleans
she
got
bit
on
the
cheek

and
uh
but
uh
that
's
about
the
the
uh
the
extent
of
it

but
but
but
when

i
really
am
a-
am
concerned
about
is
that
uh
so
many
of
these
child
care
places
are
are
coming
under
uh
uh
you
know
investigation
for
for
uh
you
know
child
molestation

and
i
and
i
and
i
'm
saying
to
myself
well
you
know
y-
you
dump
your
your
your
little
turnip
off
to
uh
you
know
this
child
care
place

and
they
do
n't
pay
very
much

and
w-
why
why
would
they
be
interested
in
in
your
little
turnip
unless
you
know
one
of
the
motivations
in
the
hidden
agenda
is
well
that
's
somebody
to
molest
you
know

and
uh
that
's
a
terrible
kind
of
thing

and
i
do
n't
think
my
children
have
ever
been
subject
to
that

but
my
wife
did
n't
work

and
so
we
really
did
n't
have
that
much
exposure
to
it

huh

huh

oh
well
that
's
interesting

oh
my
god

well
you
must
have
a
just
one
hero
ace
professional
job
to
support
something
like
that

oh
well
yeah

uh-huh

well
not
not
all
of
us

you
know
what
the
kind
of
things
you
're
supposed
to
look
for

i
'm
an
engineer

and

uh-huh

yeah

five
hundred
dollars
a
week
for
two
kids

that
's
incredible

oh
oh

well

w-

yeah

you
know

they
could

somebody
will
have
a
job
at
three
hundred
a
week
to
get
off
welfare

and
you
know
that
's
a
good
starting
wage

but
boy
three
hundred
dollars
a
week
does
n't
go
very
far
on
child
care

huh

i
mean
we
used
to
pay
pay
fifty
cents
an
hour
to
baby-sit

but
mi-
mine
are
twenty-two
twenty-three
and
twenty-seven

so
you
know
that

i
guess
baby-sitters
now
are
up
at
what
five
dollars
an
hour

oh
my

uh-huh

oh
yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
i
am
a
working
mother

i
have
three
children

and
my
children
since
i
uh
since
they
were
very
young

i
've
had
various
um
different
alternatives
child
care
arrangements

and
like
most
working
mothers
i
'm
really
not
defensive
about
it

i
personally
feel
uh
in
our
particular
situation
i
'm
a
much
better
mother
when
i
work
out
of
the
home

and
my
kids
i
think
are
very
very
secure
well
raised
children

my
comment
on
this
is
that
we
paid
an
absolute
fortune
over
the
years
for
a
variety
of
opportunities

so
i
i
i
e-

you
know
it
is
a
problem

and
but
as
you
pointed
out
i
i
think
the
real
problem
is
the
low
pay
child
facilities

and
that
is
sometimes
what
some
women
who
have
to
work
that
is
all
they
can
afford

when
our
children
were
very
young
we
had
a
pay
a
live
in
paid
baby-sitter
that
was
wonderful

and
then
as
they
got
older
they
went
to
uh
i
preferred
to
call
them
schools

and
they
were
really
all
day
preschools

and
they
were
wonderful

and
i
think
they
got
exposed
to
a
lot
of
neat
things

but
we
did
we
really
truly
did
pay
a
fortune

i
mean
we
were
paying
at
one
point
well
about
about
a
close
about
five
hundred
dollars
a
week
for
two
children

so

well
i
mus-

i
'm
a
physician
uh
and
as
is
my
husband

and
and
i
felt
uh
very
good
about
working

i
'm
a
pediatrician
actually

so
uh
but
i
think
there
are
some
wonderful
child
care
opportunities
out
there
for
children

but
and
we
all
know
the
kind
of
things
that
you
're
supposed
to
look
for
i
think

oh
well

i
think
it
's
real
important
that
you
have
a
place
that
first
of
all
parents
have
a
lot
of
input
into
and
that
they
're
always
welcome
and
that
they
have
a
lot
of
activities
where
parents
come
in
during
the
day
and
that
at
any
time
you
can
drop
in

and
we
had
a
really
wonderful
arrangement
uh

i
'm
with
the
university
actually

and
they
had
a
wonderful
uh
program
that
started
at
age
three

and
it
was
about
a
block
away
from
the
hospital
where
i
work

and
so
many
times
at
lunchtime
i
would
go
over
and
visit
the
children
and
eat
with
them
and
see
what
they
were
doing

and
they
had
wonderful

they
had
things
like
gardens
and
lots
of
pets

and
just
they
had
a
four
to
one
uh
teacher
student
ratio

so
that
that
sort
of
an

most
of
the
teachers
had
degrees
uh

yeah

it
was
incredible
actually

but
it
was
good

i
mean
it
was
it

at
that
time
there
were
two
children

and
they
were
in
special
programs

and
each
one
was
a
little
over
two
hundred
a
week

and
then
in
addition
i
paid
a
little
bit
extra

but
the
kids
were

i
mean
they
really
had
some
great
opportunities

but
tha-

what
you
were
alluding
to
earlier
is
you
know
women
who
work
for
minimal
wage
an-
and
and
really
have
t-
feel
they
have
to
put
their
children

sometimes
they
do
put
them
in
uh
fairly
low
paying
sit-
situations

uh-huh

uh-huh

no

even
that
that
really
i
think
i
do
n't

it
's
been
awhile
since
i
've
looked
at

my
youngest
child
is
eight

so
it
's
been
a
little
while
since
i
've
looked
into
actually
daycare
centers

but
they
are

you
know
the
good
ones
do
cost
maybe
sixty
dollars
a
week
since

uh-huh

something
like
that

well
you
know
but
you
made
the
comment
earlier
why
would
someone
be
interested
in
children

i
mean
it
has
been
a
real
uh

th-
there
have
been
some
good
entrepreneurial
type
experiences

and
i
think
i
think
they
have
captured
a
certain
market

again
the

but
then
there
are
baby-sitting
groups

as
a
pediatrician
one
of
the
things
we
've
been
real
concerned
about
is
the
infections

as
you
start
putting
lots
of
little
kids
together
the
infection
rates
that
go
around

i

you
know
actually
in
this
modern
day
and
age
it
seems
like
uh
uh
we
have
more
and
more
leisure
time
because
uh
we
have
so
many
convenience
appliances
and
whatnot

we
do
n't
even
have
to
cook
dinner
anymore

uh
but
i
uh
i
've
heard
i
do
n't
know
this
for
a
fact
but
i
've
heard
that
a
lot
of
families
really
do
n't
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
together

that
ki-
the
kids
maybe
on
the
average
get
uh
something
like
thirty
seconds
of
quality
time
with
the
parents

it
seems
bizarre
to
me

i
do
n't
quite
understand
it
although
i
think
probably
the
the
worst
thing
that
's
happening
in
the
world
at
least
the
modern
world
today
is
television

not
so
much
because
uh
it
's
bad
per
se
although
there
is
some
pretty
crappy
programming

and
i
thin-
there
's
also
some
uh
i
think
uh
poorer
lifestyles
illustrated
but
simply
because
it
dominates
so
much
discussionary
time

it
's
so
darned
easy
to
turn
the
thing
on

so
i
refuse
to
have
one
in
the
house

yeah

uh-huh

well
i
'll
tell
you

television
sure
makes
child
rearing
easy
on
you

i
mean
the
kids
can
be
a
real
pest
uh

and
turning
the
t
v
on
is
almost
like
magic
you
know

it
's
like
sticking
uh
an
electrode
into
their
pleasure
center

and
you
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
them

but
i
do
n't
think
it
's
too
good

uh
so
you
know
i
do
n't
know

i
take
advantage

i
do
n't
have
a
great
deal
of
time
to
spend
with
the
kids

but
i
take
advantage
of
um
dinner
time

we
always
eat
together

and
you
know
whenever
you
're
with
your
kids
you
want
to
interact
with
them
rather
than
just
ignore
them

uh
i
guess
our
big
outlet
is
music
uh

our
thirteen
year
old
son
plays
violin

and
our
nine
year
old
daughter
plays
cello

and
uh
when
our
son
started
playing
violin
i
took
up
violin

and
when
our
daughter
started
playing
cello
i
took
up
cello

so
there
's
plenty
of
plenty
of
interactive
time
in
uh
practicing
although
neither
kid
likes
to
practice

i
guess
that
's
not
a
big
surprise

but
i
mea-
i
imagine
with
infants
you
are
most
of
your
time
is
sort
of
spent
taking
care
of
them
rather
than
interacting
with
them
although

oh
you
know
reading
is
so
good

i
uh
i
took
great
pleasure
in
reading
to
my
kids
when
they
were
little

and
i
still
try
to
read
to
them
although
our
son
is
not
liking
that
anymore

uh
but
i
read
you
know

there
's
this
doctor
seuss
sleep
book

have
you
ever
seen
that
yet

yeah

it
's
called
a
sleep
book

and
uh
you
ought
to
get
it

i
tell
you
i
read
that
book
to
my
kids
so
many
times
i
almost
have
the
thing
memorized

uh

yeah

well
i
think
i
think
his
sleep
book
is
my
favorite

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

so
how
much
time
do
you
think
you
spend
with
your
kids
on
the
average
per
each
day

oh
that
's
great

oh
i
see

ho-
how
old
are
your
kids
again

two
and
one

yeah

so
you
have
your
hands
full
with
them

that
's
for
sure

yes

yeah

really

that
's
what
i
've
heard
too
uh

yeah

right

i
know
it

i
've
i
tell
myself
sometimes
just
sit
down
after
work

oh
really

well
good
for
you

good
for
you

a
lot
of
people
i
talk
to
a
lot
of
people
about
that

and
i
've
thought
about
it
myself

and
i
though
about
it
a
lot

but
uh
i
still
have
n't
done
it
yet

well
that
's
good

that
's
true

i
've
noticed
that

i
do
n't
think
so
either

do
you
keep
your
kids
uh
active
in
sports
or
anything

or

oh
okay

okay

no

not
for
kids

yeah

well
i
i
try
and
read
to
them

and
i
take
them
to
the
park
and
stuff

and
yeah

yeah

well
they
get
to
that
stage

sleep
book

no

we
've
got
quite
a
few
of
doctor
seuss'
books

oh
really

well
yeah

i
like
to
i
like
to
do
it

and
they
enjoy
reading

i
've
actually
i
never
read
a
lot
growing
up

and
i
never
read
until
a
few
years
ago

i
just
started
picking
up
books

and
so
i
've
found
that
you
know
it
's
really
important
to
me
to
get
to
read

to
i
like
to
get
away
in
a
book
you
know

and
so
i
've
put
a
lot
more
emphasis
on
that
on
my
kids
to
try
and

oh
i
probably
spend
an
hour
or
two

my
wife
works
at
night

so
she
does
uh
tupperware

so
she
's
gone
a
lot
at
nights

and
so
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
them

they
're
two
and
one

uh-huh

yeah

i
uh
try
to
stay
away
from
cars
as
much
as
possible
in
terms
of
repair

actually
uh
that
is
really
a
sore
spot
with
me

i
i
think
perhaps
the
automotive
industry
is
improving

but
uh
like
ten
years
ago
uh
reliability
of
automobiles
at
least
u
s
automobiles
was
pretty
dismal

and
not
only
that
but
the
uh
repair
capability
of
uh
service
departments
and
dealerships
was
equally
dismal

and
uh
it
seemed
that
the
only
way
i
could
reliably
take
care
of
my
car
was
to
repair
it
myself
which
is
not
my
cup
of
tea

but
uh
i

pardon

well
at
that
time
actually
i
had
a
volkswagen
rabbit

and
uh
it
was
it
was
a
real
lemon

uh
subsequently
i
got
a
uh
buick
century

and
it
was
n't
as
bad

but
uh
last
year
i
bought
a
honda
accord

and
i
take
it
in
once
every
seventy-five
hundred
miles
for
its
periodic
maintenance

and
that
is
it

and
it
's
wonderful

huh

huh

huh

so
wha-
what
do
you
have

all
the
more
reason
to
uh
have
a
a
honda

d-
so
you
bought
a
pontiac

now
thi-

wha-
how
old
is
the
car

huh

huh

huh

so
apparently
it
was
the
same
one
that
was
on
there

apparently
just
uh
re-
re-
uh
probably
filled
the
the
brake
fluid
up

and
that
was
it

so
what
's
the
solution
to
that
i
guess
find
a
reputable
service

huh

uh-huh

right

well
that
's
wonderful

you
're
lucky

oh
really

huh

uh-huh

yeah

so
do
you
have
a
car

do
you
have
a
car

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

we
used
to
have
a
honda
accord

and
they
're
good

they
're
really
good
cars

every
time
i
get
taken
to
an
auto
repair
place
you
know
every
time
i
go
i
get
taken

bad
you
know

woman
goes
in

and
they
go
all
right
we
got
a
sucker

let
's
ge-
see
how
much
money
we
can
get
out
of
her
you
know

that
's
what
happens
every
time

uh
so

i
have
a
pontiac
six
thousand

yeah

but
our
honda
just
got
old
and
just
wore
out

it
was
let
's
see
eleven
years
old

and
it
just
just
out
of
it

so
no

huh-uh

my
hu-
uh
ex-husband
's

this
is
just
happened
a
couple
of
weeks
ago

he
's
my
ex-husband

but
just
a
few
months
ago
when
he
was
my
husband
uh
his
father
gave
us
this
car

and
everything
is
wrong
with
it

i
mean
the
power
steering
fluid
leaks
the
oil
leaks
the
brake
fluid
leaks
you
know

uh
eighty-seven

and
he
just
does
n't
take
care
of
things

and
but
i
was
awarded
the
car

so
there
is
a
man
in
my
church
that
is
a
mechanic

and
i
can
trust
him

so
he
is
trying
to
get
you
know
things
fixed
on
it

but
it
's
just
you
know
leak
leak
leak
everywhere

but
uh
you
know
i
hate
to
go
into
a
a
repair
place
because
they
'll
tell
me
something
is
wrong
with
it
and
it
's
not
you
know
and
charge
me
twice
as
much

the
last
time
i
took
it
into
a
repair
shop

the
man
told
me
i
needed
a
master
cylinder

so
i
said
okay

and
he
charged
me
a
hundred
and
thirty
something
dollars

and
then
uh
about
a
month
later
a
man
was
looking
at
my
car

and
he
asked
me

you
know
not
a
man
not
a
repair
man
but
just
a
friend

and
i
was
telling
him
that
i
just
a
new
master
cylinder
put
on

and
he
looked
at

and
he
said
that
's
not
a
new
master
cylinder

and
i
did
n't
even
know
what
one
was

and
uh
he
showed
it
to
me

and
it
was
old
rusty
just
awful

it
was
no
more
new
than
nothing

uh
more
than
likely

that
was
it
probably

it
was
ve-

i
was
so
irritated

and
that
's
happened
to
me
more
than
once
or
twice
jus-
just
just
about
every
time
i
've
went
in
somewhere

and
and
you
ju-
can
hardly
find
one
you
know

the
guy
that
's
doing
most
of
my
my
car
now
uh
goes
to
my
church

and
that
's
the
only
reason
you
know
i
go
to
him
because
i
know
him

and
i
know
he
will
tell
me
the
truth

because
he
does
n't
even
charge
me
for
for
doing
it

so
he
's
not
going
to
you
know
take
me

i
just
pay
for
the
parts

and
he
does
it
so

yeah

yeah

i
am

so
i
do
n't
know

i
do
n't
know
what
the
solution
to
that
is
because
the
place
where
you
buy
your
car
they
're
usually
the
worst
one
of
all

we
took
our
honda
to
the
honda
dealership

and
they
ended
up
telling
us
we
needed
a
brand
new
engine
for
our
car

yeah

and
so
idiots
as
we
were
neither
one
of
us
knew
much
about
cars

we
you
know
they
told
us
we
just
had
to
have
one

and
we
bought
one

we
did
n't
no
more
need
no
new
engine

give
me
break
you
know

so
it
was
it
was
not
good

and
uh

uh
i
think
uh
actually
i
'm
fairly
pleased
with
the
benefits
that
we
have
at
the
uh
working
for
a
large
corporation

and
for
me
there
's
absolutely
no
question
what
's
the
most
important
benefit

i
think
it
's
health
care

it
's
what

i
think
everybody
would
say
that

right

belonging
to
a
group
is
the
belonging
to
a
health
group
is
probably
the
most
important
protection
you
can
have
after
you

uh
so-
the
uh

sometimes
i
think
it
's
more
important
than
salary

yes

and
uh
i
do
n't
know
if
i
would
rank
that
second

but
uh
since
i
have
three
boys
uh
it
it
can
turn
out
to
be
important

yeah

you
know

in
a
in
a
given
year
dental
ca-
dental
expenses
can
really
kill
you

right

right

it
's
uh

right

uh
and
then
uh
uh
if
the
cleaning
does
n't
get
you
the
orthodony
will

uh
i
guess
that
would
be
up
there

uh
i
'm
not
sure
if
i
would
rank
uh
how
i
would
rank
that
next
to
say
compared
to
retirement

or
uh
uh
uh
pretax
savings
was
another
thing
that
i
think
is
a
a
great
a
great
benefit

and
i
i
think
it
's
really
something
that
the
uh
the
government
ought
to
encourage
more
because
uh
there
are
all
these
complaints
about
how
we
're
not
a
saving
country
and
where
the
average
savings
rate
is
something
like
four
percent
in
this
country
and
fifteen
percent
in
uh
germany
and
japan
uh

right

when
you
have
the
when
you
have
the
uh
the
economy
to
scale
and
everything
that
a
large
corporation
has
and
you
can
uh
offer
some
incentive

and
if
the
government
goes
along
by
not
taxing
it
when
you
put
it
aside
you
can
really
build
up
uh
the
savings
and
the
that
you
would
n't
otherwise
do

and

leave

you
know
i
i
do
n't
think
so
yet

they
may
have
uh
just
plain
parental
leave
which
either
one
can
take

uh
i
their
uh
i
know
their
maternity
leave
is
on
the
order
of
six
weeks
which
i
think
is
too
short
uh

uh
uh
i
really
think
that
we
need
to
get
into
the
mold
where
we
talk
about
years
rather
than
months
or
weeks

right

and
uh

there

there
ought
to
be
uh
uh
some
compromise
that
could
where
uh
where
the
person
would
be
guaranteed
a
uh
career
type
position
but
not
necessarily
a
continuation
of
exactly
the
same
position
uh
in
exchange
for
a
longer
period
of
time

it
's
uh
it
's
so
important
to
families
then

and
uh
and
yet
anybody
whose
gotten
far
enough
to
get
a
good
salary
is
really
reluctant
to
give
that
up

uh

that

yeah

you
're
right

i
think
you
've
put
your
finger
on
the
one
benefit
that
i
that
i
would
most
like
to
see
uh
changed
uh
the
uh
parental
leave

right

right

they
do
it
by
shortchanging
their
kids

there
's
no
other
way
i
mean
uh
unless
they
're
part
of
some
extended
family
which
is
unlikely
uh

people
moving
as
much

and
uh
they
just
it
's
just
a
terrible
choice

you
should
n't
have
to
make
it

uh
you
're
right

and
uh

oh
right

boy

would
i
like
to
have
that

yeah

oh
listen
i
have
friends
in
a
lot
of
different
cities

if
you
just
fly
me
there

i
'll
take
care
of
that

right

so
and
uh
i
guess
the

right

oh
and
if
you
try
to
get
it
outside
of
your
corporation
you
're
going
to
pay
an
arm
and
a
leg

right

uh
do
you
also
get
dental

oh
i
know

now
my
husband
is
with
uh
northwest
airlines

and
he
gets
uh
you
know
the
full
health
and
dental

and
uh
we
have
four
children

and
what
you
pay
just
to
have
teeth
cleaned
is
outrageous

and
i
do
n't
know
how
people
that
do
n't
have
it
can
afford
it

or
maybe
they
do
n't

that
's
right

that
's
right

uh-huh

right

right

well
it
's
a
lot
easier
to
to
save
it
when
you
do
n't
get
your
hands
on
it
first

right

uh
what
about
what
about
uh
lesser
uh
benefits
perhaps
for
you
but
for
for
the
women
in
the
in
the
corporation

for
example
uh
oh

yeah

do
they
e-
even
do
they
have
father
leaves
or
anything
like
that

uh-huh

oh
i
do
too

oh
i
think
i
think
it
's
just
a
crying
shame
uh
for
a
mother
to
have
to
go
back
to
work
at
six
weeks

she
is
n't
recovered

and
uh
the
infant
needs
her
desperately
at
that
point
and
time

uh-huh

right

i
agree

oh
sure

especially
in
this
day
and
age

you
do
n't
want
to
start
over
again
anywhere

well
i
think
they
're
at
they
're
com-
they
've
come
a
long
way
uh
at
least
some
companies
some
of
them
uh
my
girlfriend
in
particular
that
works
for
a
a
rental
car
agency

and
uh
as
manager
and
uh
they
have
a
very
very
poor
leave
policy

and
uh
i
just
do
n't
know
how
how
women
do
it

particularly
single
parents
who
do
n't
have
the
support
at
the
other
end
uh

that
's
right

that
's
exactly
right

right

uh-huh

one
of
the
benefits
we
get
of
course
is
travel

it
's
wonderful

the
only
trouble
is
that
you
can
afford
to
go
anywhere

but
you
ca
n't
afford
to
stay
once
you
get
there

that
's
right

you
have
to
have
an
awful
lot
of
fun

just
just
getting
there
is
has
to
be
half
the
fun

and
you
say
you
have
some
strong
feelings
about
uh
the
issue

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

right

well
i
'm
a
little
bit
ambivalent

the
problem
with
uh
and
i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
immigration
policy
is
like
any
other
political
problem
is
that
people
are
not
willing
to
discuss
it
uh
in
in
terms
of
what
uh
really
is
driving
it

they
're
not
willing
to
tell
the
truth
the
same
way
with
uh
issues
of
uh
race
and
things
like
that

i
mean
right
now
uh
i
believe
there
are
two
policies
that
uh
that
the
government
uses
to
modulate
immigration
three
actually

one
is
at
the
high
end
uh

they
always
want
to
be
able
to
uh
do
some
brain
draining

they
always
like
to
be
able
to
attract
the
uh
einsteins
or
the
professor
chou

or
you
know

they
'd
like
to
be
able
to
get
the
top
people
in
any
field

and
so
they
can
almost
always
find
room
for
someone
like
that

at
the
bottom
end
they
uh
are
always
willing
to
uh
let
in
cheap
labor
if
it
lowers
the
cost
of
doing
business
in
some
particular
area
and
has
strong
support
from
the
powerful
people
in
that
area

those
are
two
things
that
i
think
are
going
on
although
they
i
i
do
n't
think
the
politicians
would
tell
you
that

and
then
the
third
thing
is
uh
the
political
aspect
of
uh
uh
letting
steam
come
out
from
under
the
lid
in
mexico

they
cannot
close
off
the
mexican
border
not
because
it
's
physically
impossible
but
because
the
explosion
that
would
take
place
in
mexico
would
be
uh
uh
would
spill
over
to
this
country

so
they
keep
allowing
uh
the
pressure
cooker
to
let
off
steam

uh
that
's
one
of
the
few
things
i
guess
i
found
myself
in
agreement
with
pat
buchanan

i
think
they
're
a
very
difficult
group
to
integrate
into
uh
society

they
're
very
difficult
uh
group
to
find
jobs
and
uh
and
uh
places
for

and
so
uh
uh
i
do
n't
deny
that
we
may
have
been
involved
in
causing
the
problem
that
uh
in
that
they
're
pretty
miserable
where
they
are

but
i
'm
not
to
sympathetic
about
uh
letting
large
numbers
of
haitians
in

yeah

right

but
if
you
let
them
yeah
if
you
let
them
in
a
million
at
a
time
it
would
n't
make
that
you
know
it
would
n't
make
that
big
a
bulge
in
the
population
but
po-
politically
and
economically

yeah

well
i
know
about
it

uh
i
mean
it
's
it
is
now
with
haitians
the
way
it
was
with
cubans
uh
twenty
years
ago

on
the
other
hand
you
know
the
ironic
thing
about
this
is
that
there
's
nobody
more
full
of
the
entrepreneurial
american
spirit
than
our
first
generation
immigrant

so
there
's
uh
there
's
a
lot
to
be
said
for
having
a
steady
stream
of
people
who
know
how
it
is
someplace
else
coming
in

right

sure

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh
yes

i
do
as
far
as
uh
as
far
as
uh
as
far
as
immigration
as
a
whole
goes

i
think
that
uh
we
simply
must
start
accepting
everybody
in
the
world

uh
i

there
just
is
not
going
to
be
room
for
all
of
us

we
do
n't
have
jobs
now

i
i
think
uh
i
think
when
we
come
to
a
time
of
recession
that
it
's
particularly
important
that
we
shut
our
doors
at
that
time

uh
i
hope
you
're
one
of
the
employed
right
now

i
am
one
of
the
unemployed
right
now

i
was
a
systems
analysis
and
programmer
for
an
oil
company

and
uh
i
applied
for
one
set
of
jobs
with
a
company
here
in
dallas
that
they
had
two
hundred
openings

but
they
had
two
thousand
applications

and
i
know
that
there
are
a
lot
of
foreigners
uh
here
you
know
doing
my
line
of
work

and
of
course
i
'm
not
perfectly
happy
about
not
having
a
job

so
how
do
you
feel

right

okay

and
i
think
you
're
right
in
both
cases

and
i
think
probably
it
's
pretty
important
right
there

how
do
you
feel
about
haitian
immigration

actually
actually
i
feel
that
if
we
accepted
these
people
that
we
would
eventually
have
almost
the
total
population
here

and
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
political
situations

it
would
have
to
do
with
poverty

oh
my
gosh

have
you
been
have
you
been
to
southern
florida

well
i
mean
and
the
two
of
them
together

i
mean
we
can

it
's
just
as
well
you
know

it
's
hardly
america
anymore

but
there
's
some
differences
in
the
immigrants
that
that
we
're
getting
now

well
i
particularly
have
a
problem
with
the
illegal
immigration

i
think
probably
your
a
great
deal
of
what
you
say
is
true
about
the
legals

but
uh
the
majority
of
the
illegal
immigration
we
're
getting
now
they
do
not
come
here
to
blend
into
america

uh
they
they
do
n't
bother
to
learn
our
language

and
uh
first
of
all
th-
they

i
'm
sorry
this
i
really
feel
strongly
about
this

we
send
a
lot
of
money
to
mexico

why
do
n't
you
start

things
you
already
owned
or
things
that
you
've
picked
up
just
to
do
that

are
they
things
you
already
owned
or
you
pick
them
up
just
to
do
that
refinishing

yeah

i
've
done
both

uh
uh
my
wife
has
picked
up
a
couple
of
things
saying
uh
boy
if
we
could
refinish
that
that
would
be
a
beautiful
piece
of
furniture

and
uh
we
've
done
it
a
couple
of
times

i
guess
that
we
've
been
fairly
successful
with
those

that
's
uh
that
's
a
kind
of
low
risk
sort
of
project
is
n't
it
i
guess

uh
i
have
a
a
uh
really
nice
desk
a
nicer
desk
than
i
could
afford
which
i
got
because
my
sister
who
worked
in
a
hospital
uh
liberated
it
after
a
fire

and
uh
we
stripped
it
all
the
way
down
and
refinished
it

and
it
turned
out
to
be
really
nice
uh
a
nice
desk
maple
top
i
think
or
or
something
of
that
sort

oh
really

oh
i
'm
jealous

uh-huh

yeah

i
i
do
do
things
uh
that
might
be
too
crude
to
be
called
woodworking

i
've
built
my
own
deck
and
uh
things
like
that

and
uh
i
definitely
have
begun
to
accumulate
tools
too

my
i
uh
i
picked
up
a
bunch
of
craftsman
tools
from
the
forties
that
my
wife
's
father
owned
when
he
was
alive

and
so
i
do
have
a
band
saw
and
a
router
and
uh
things
like
that
out
in
the
garage

but
i
ca
n't
say
i
use
them
very
often

they
're
handy
uh
they
they
come
in
handy
at
the
most
unusual
times

putting
doors
in
is
the
time
when
i
'm

uh
i
bought
myself
a
uh
template
for
making
mortices
and
doors

and
that
's
a
whole
lot
easier
than
doing
it
with
a
chisel

but
i
've
also
i
've
also
used
them
for
building
drawers
where
you
uh
for
rabbeting
and
uh
because
uh
rabbeting
on
my
table
on
my
uh
radial
arm
saw
is
a
little
bit
uncertain

so
i
got
one
for
christmas
a
few
years
ago
and
used
it
quite
a
bit
for
the
first
eight
months
i
had
it

and
now
i
use
it
twice
a
year
maybe

the
big

uh
i
guess
it

the
ones
that
what

uh
i
have
never
even
s-
i
have
never
even
looked
at
one
closely

uh
the
the
little
use
that
i
've
gotten
from
my
router
i
would
say
uh
i
would
spend
my
money
on
the
bits

uh
i
have
a
i
'd
guess
you
'd
call
a
medium
quality
craftsman
router

and
the
uh

it
's
strong
enough
for
any
job
where
you
do
n't
try
to
take
more
than
say
three-eighths
of
an
inch
at
a
time

but
the
problem
is
that
the
uh
as
with

any
any
time
you
buy
a
a
tool
with
a
a
as
a
as
a
package
the
bits
that
they
give
you
are
low
end

so
the
price
of
a
good
set
of
uh
carbide
steel
uh
bits
is
probably
uh
i
mean
a
a
good
set
of
bits
is
probably
going
to
run
you
a
hundred
dollars

and
uh
uh
if
you
're
going
to
use
for
a
lifetime
i
suppose
it
's
worth
it

because
y-
e-
uh

i
imagine
if
i
go
and
sharpen
them
myself
uh
they
wo
n't
last

and
i
've
never
had
the
bits
sharpened

so
that
's
a
thing
to
consider
is
to

yeah

and
they
they
dull
after
awhile

especially
i
did
some
cabinets
in
uh
ash
and
oak

and
uh
that
that
wears
a
bit
down

we
remodeled
and
saved
a
bunch
of
really
nice
ash
cabinets
uh
which
had
been
in
the
original
remodeling
of
our
kitchen

and
i
saved
them
and
built
an
oven
cabinet
out
of
one
and
another
cabinet
out
of
another
by
using
the
faces
and
so
forth

and
uh
routing
hardwood
will
uh
take
the
edge
off
a
cheap
bit
pretty
fast

so

right

that
's
uh

and
then
you
take
the
blade
to
the
to
get
sharpened
right

uh-huh

right

yeah

well
i
've
used
mine
on
treated
wood

and
now
all
my
blades
need
sharpening
because
uh
treated
wood
will
also
chew
them
up

oh
i
do
n't
know

i
uh
i
refinished
a
couple
of
old
uh
dressers
that
were
gi-
handed
down

you
know
nice
it
's
nice
tongue
and
groove
uh
uh
construction

uh
that
's
been
i
've
been
pretty
successful
with
that

what

no

i
've
done
some
other
things
too
uh
you
know

yeah

oh
yeah

yeah

that
's
a
good
way
to
get
started

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

i
i
uh
put
together
a
a
up
rolltop
desk
from
scratch

you
know
a
kit

yeah

still
had
to
cut
it
and
everything

but
it
was
fun

uh-huh

yeah

i
i
've
done
the
same
you
know
like
the
trim
around
the
house
you
know
the
baseboards
and
things
like
that

uh-huh

um
yeah

i
'm
looking
at
trying
to
get
a
router
right
now

i
'll
bet

uh-huh

yeah

my
br-
my
brother
's
used
it
a
lot
for
making
drawers

i
do
n't
know

what
what
's
your
opinion
of
wha-
what
a
good
router
is
like

you
know
i

because
he
was
tell
me
like
the
ones
that
you
dial
in
are
n't
all
that
great

they
've
plastic
parts
and
stuff

that
you
dial
in
on
the
side

uh-huh

uh-huh

how
strong
is
it

do
n't
they

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

they
they
really
get
hot
do
n't
they

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

yeah

i
've
cut
some
one
by
eight
oak
before

boy
was
that
fun

big
solid
pieces
of
oak
are
just
tough

well
that
was
you
know
with
a
with
a
circular
saw

like
oh
my
gosh

is
this
going
to
be
fun

yeah

treated
wood
can
really
make
you
sick
too

so
uh
what
things
do
you
consider
an
invasion
of
privacy

oh
i
do
n't
know

i
had
a
little
bit
more
time
to
think
about
it

i
was
thinking
of
like
uh

i
do
n't
know

i
was
ju-
started
to
think
about
all
the
big
you
know
data
bases
they
have
with
all
the
information
about
you
on
them
like
the
credit
reports
and
all
those
you
know
demographics
studies
that
they
do
that
um
you
know
have
who
knows
how
much
you
know
stuff
about
all
the
purchases
that
you
've
made
and
everything
kept
tract
somewhere

and
i
do
n't
know

i
do
n't
know
how
much
the
stuff
actually
what
they
actually
have
in
there

but
i
know
they
use
that
i
mean
they
sell
those

yeah

that
was
that
that
was
the
other
one
i
was
thinking
of

i
think
that
's
uh

i
mean
i
know
drugs
are
illegal

huh
uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
i
i
think
the
i
think
that
you
know
a
person
's
competence
should
be
more
determined
by
you
know
their
actions
and
their
behavior

and
if
they
're
you
know
if
they
're
on
some
kind
of
you
know
contol-
controlled
substance
then
you
know
it
kinds
of
takes
away
from
the
job
of
you
know
the
supervisor
or
manager
type
person
you
know
who
is
able
to
evaluate
them

i
think
they
should
be
evaluated
that
way
rather
than
with
a
you
know
a
chemical
you
know

these
people
that
are
carriers
and
do
n't
that
do
n't
reveal
it

yeah
tha-
that
would
be
kind
of
an
extreme

i
mean
i
've
heard
of
things
like
you
know
making
them
you
know
marking
them
somehow
or
you
know
or
something
like
that
or
you
know
putting
them
all
someplace
like
in
a
kind
of

yeah

wel-
i
guess
it
kind
of
borders
on
where
i
mean
what
do
you
value
more
the
invasion
of
uh
the
person
's
privacy
or
the
possible
danger
to
you
know
other
people

yeah

i
guess
that
's
alwa-
that
's
been
the
big
role
of
government
i
guess
i
mean
generally

yeah

yeah

well
that
's
kind
of
a
difficult
one
to
go
into

i
mean
that
that
particular
case

because
i
mean
there
's
a
lot
of
people
that
uh
i
mean
they
could
require
you
know
ob-
obligatory
aids
testing
for
everyone
because
i
'm
you
know
there
's
a
huge
part
of
the
population

not
a
huge
part
but
a
you
know

the
aids
population
i
guess
that
have
it
that
do
n't
know
they
do
are
spreading
it

but
again
to
require
you
know
such
a
test
and
jus-
and
then
to
make
make
it
is
to
subject
them
to
to
discrimi-
discriminatory
practices
and
other
things

i
do
n't
know

uh
i
do
n't
know
how
exactly
i
feel
about
that

ooh
well
i
do
n't
know

what
do
you
think

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

well
what
about
uh
required
drug
testing
uh
as
a
uh
condition
of
employment

it
thing
actually

uh
i
uh
have
worked
at
texas
instruments

and
uh
they
instituted
a
drug
policy
there
drug
testing
policy
where
they
randomly
would
test
uh
employees

and
actually
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
really
did
not
think
much
about
it

i
i
had
n't
you
know

it
really
did
n't
relate
to
me

but
there
were
some
things
that
people
brought
up
like
well
what
happens
if
they
they
get
a
false
positive
you
know
what
recourse
do
you
have

and
also
uh
uh
this
is
against
the
law
for
the
government
to
do
this
kind
of
thing
this
kind
of
big
brother
activity

and
yet
uh
a
lot
of
these
large
corporations
such
as
texas
instruments
although
they
do
n't
admit
to
it
it
's
actually
oh
a
drug
testing
policy
comes
about
as
a
result
of
government
pressure

so
what
that
means
is
to
me
that
really
it
's
the
government
that
's
requiring
this

although
they
do
n't
actually
e-
execute
it
themselves
it
's
really
the
government
that

so
in
that
sense
it
at
least
philosophically
it
's
really
borderline
legal

well
what
about
this
uh
aids
epidemic
now

where
you
find
that
uh
uh
you
know
certain
people
are
actually
are
are
criminal
in
their
disregard
for
it-
others

yeah

and
and
uh
of
course
the
ultimate
solution
is
to
operate
on
their
brain
so
that
it
does
n't

it
uh
it
destroys
their
libido

now
uh
you
know
if
they
ever

so
what
about
that
as
an
invasion
of
privacy

so
really

it
i-
gets
to
balancing
uh
personal
freedom
against
uh
the
general
welfare
of
society

well
it
it
's
supposed
to
have
been

no

it

a
growing
part

uh-huh

maybe
chop
their
weenies
off

yeah

i
guess
uh
uh
it
's
an
easy
one
for
me

i
think
that
's
uh
there
's
something
seriously
wrong

yeah

uh
i
guess
uh
i
think
they
've
lost
their
compass

and
uh
i
'm
not
sure
they
know
exactly
what
uh
uh
public
education
supposed
to
be
for
anymore

but
uh
i
voted
with
my
feet

and
uh
my
kids
go
to
parochial
school

so
uh

well
one
hundred
percent
of
the
uh
customers
care

that
's
one
thing

everybody
cares
about
the
education
the
kids
are
getting

and
uh
they
uh
take
an
active
relatively
active
part

which
uh
i
mean
if
you
're
uh
sending
two
thousand
dollars
that
way
every
year
you
uh
watch
what
goes
on
and
you
uh
uh
pay
attention
and
participate

and
and
you
can
influence
the
way
things
are

yeah

the
immediacy
just
is
n't
there

and
uh
uh
i
also
think
that
one
of
the
problems

and
actually
i
do
n't
think
this
i
think
this
is
a
cultural
problem

the
uh
problem
with
public
education
is
really
uh
really
a
problem
with
the
culture

and
i
guess
my
evidence
for
that
is
the
school
districts
in
places
like
california
for
example
where
only
a
minority
of
the
taxpayers
have
children
in
school

and
you
ca
n't
get
a
tax
levy
passed

uh
people
are
uh
reluctant
to
pass
uh
school
tax
levies
even
uh
when
the
money
is
needed
or
would
be
well
spent
because
it
's
uh
they
do
n't
have
kids
in
the
schools

i
think
that
's
a
a
loss
of
civic
virtue
and
a
loss
of
uh
uh
the
cultural
attitude
that
we
used
to
have
that
education
was
first
even
if
it
was
n't
our
kids

i
think
that
's
uh
that
's
the
principal
problem
is
that
uh
people
no
longer
see
it
as
uh
as
their
problem

and
there
's
an
immediate
problem

right

yeah

yeah

you
know
i
i
believe
that
the
original
idea
of
public
education
in
the
united
states
which
i
guess
was
controversial
at
the
time
of
the
constitution

uh
you
know
it
barely
made
it

i
think
it
was
added
afterwards

i
think
the
real
the
principal
was
uh
education
for
civic
participation

the
idea
was
that
everybody
should
have
an
education
so
that
they
would
be
a
better
voter

and
you
could
n't
pull
the
wool
over
their
eyes

well
that
's
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
say

now
there
seem
to
be
really
three
reasons
for
education

one
is
education
for
civic
duty

one
is
education
for
economic
reasons

and
one
is
education
for
civilization

i
mean
and
i
think
that
one

that
's
what
i
used
to
think
education
was
all
about
when
i
was
a
college
professor

and
then
i
quit
and
got
disabused
of
that
notion

but
uh
the
uh
uh
now
the
only
thing
people
seem
to
agree
on
is
that
education
is
uh
an
economic
enterprise
to
train
people
for
jobs

and
uh
i
'm
not
sure
that
people
in
the
education
establishment
really
know
what
their
purpose
is

and
i
'm
really
sad
to
say
this

i
never
thought
i
would
have

but
i
really
think
that
uh
the
educational
establishment
has
become
part
of
the
problem

and
uh
that
's
why
i
guess
i
'm
sort
of
reluctantly
uh
in
favor
of
these
uh
choice
programs

right

that
's
what

what
is
it
that
you
are
you
know
particularly
upset
about

uh-huh

what
do
you
feel
that
your
kids
are
getting
in
the
parochial
schools
that
they
would
n't
get
in
a
the
public
school
system

so
you
're
saying
that
the
taxpayer
who
also
is
really
paying
through
the
pocketbook
for
the
education
of
the
child
may
not
be
quite
so
conscious
of
the
fact
that
they
are
paying
the
tuition
for
that
child
in
the
form
of
uh
real
estate
or
other
taxes

and
and
consequently
they
're
not
so
motivated
to
get
involved
and
make
sure
things
happen
the
way
they
'd
like
to
see
them
happen

uh-huh

right

right

it
troubles
me
too
tha-
that
the
priority
seems
to
be
with
my
particular
purse
strings
rather
than
the
public
good

and
by
definition
for
some
of
us
at
least
the
public
good
includes
having
an
educated
populace
and
then
idea
that
uh
you
can
make
a
sound
judgment
with
respect
to
small
votes
in
the
at
the
local
level
or
bigger
votes
at
the
national
level

uh
it
means
that
you
've
got
to
be
informed

and
you
've
got
to
have
a
certain
level
of
education
to
do
the
reading
and
the
critical
thinking
involved
to
come
up
with
a
decision

right

right

it
has
taken
on
a
more
profound

and
you
'd
think
we
'd
notice
it
economic
uh
thrust

yeah

well
i
'm
glad
that
you
added
that
one

yeah

i
think
that
one
's
significant

right

well
i
i
g-
agree
with
everything
that
you
've
said
so
far

and
the
only
that
i
'd
want
to
add
is
that
i
'm
a
little
more
in
contact
i
think
with
public
school
teachers
than
perhaps
you
are
uh
except
as
a
parent
of
your
child

and
the
sense
that
i
get
from
public
school
teachers
that
i
know
is
that
they
are
very
conscious
of
what
they
feel
they
should
be
doing

and
they
are
the
three
things
that
you
mentioned

but
they
find
that
they
are
also
being
asked
to
do
a
bunch
of
other
stuff
which
they
think
is
only
tangentially
related

like
consumer

yeah

well
twenty-seven
up

and
we
had
five

oh
yeah

and
how
about
yourself

oh

well

yeah

well
when
mine
were
growing
up
i
did
some
traveling
and
but
not
that
extensively

but
i
always
just
made
it
a
point
you
know
to
spend
about
ten
minutes
with
each
one
of
them

so
it
was
an
hour
you
know

but
whether
it
was
going
back
and
laying
in
bed
with
them
and
just
shooting
the
breeze
or
whatever
telling
them
stories
or
reading
to
them

six
years

yeah

oh
yeah

we
look
back
and
wonder
how
we
did
it

no

she
never
did

well
yeah

yeah

yeah

well
that
's
plenty
though

yeah

right

well
you
know
with
kids
you
're
not
going
to
have
a
neat
house

and
you
know
it
it
's
tough
to
find
time
e-
espec-
especially
with
both
of
them
working

and
you
just
have
to
set
the
time
and
say
okay
this
is
going
to
be
it

right

right

well
that
's
good
too

yeah

that
's
good
that
way
too

yeah

well
that
they
say
it
it
all
it
takes
is
about
five
ten
minutes
a
day

and
you
know
and
as
the
kids
got
older
i
made
them
you
know
help
me
cut
the
grass
and
kind
of
made
that
a
project
too
or
whatever

and

oh
yeah

and
uh
well
yeah

if

yeah

just
keep
them
talking
that
way

but
uh
another
thing
we
used
to
do
is
have
ham-
family
councils
every
sunday
night

discuss
everything
that
did
n't
agree
with
them

and
we
'd
take
turns
being
president

and
everyone
would
get
one
vote

and
i
always
thought
we
'd
get
outvoted
five
to
two

but
it
never
worked
that
way

yeah

well
and
we
could
bring
up
and
we
could
bring
up
stuff
too

and
that
was
always
good
time

boy
we
really
got
to
know
the
kids
well

oh
yeah

in
fact
they
were
all
in
uh
over
the
weekend
for
easter

well
we
did
too

and
i
remember
the
one
daughter
saying
we
had
a
a
friend
of
hers
that
used
to
drive
us
up
a
tree

and
she
said
hey
i
do
n't
make
fun
fun
of
your
friends

so
why
make
fun
of
mine

kind
of
r-
kind
of
hit
us
between
the
eyes

no

but
that
that
was
always
good
quality
time
for
us

and
then
never
attend

but
if
if
they
missed
it
they
had
to
abide
by
the
rules

yeah

and
boy
they
they
'd
show
up

and
we
'd
usually
take
notes

and
you
know
the
younger
kids
uh
or
maybe
all
of
them
needed
help
at
one
time
or
another

and
uh
but
they
were
usually
tougher
on
themselves
than
they
were
on
us

and
they
loved
it

yeah

yeah

yeah

but
uh
boy
i
i
feel
for
you
and
your
husband

well
my
my
uh
two
of
my
uh

kids
too

oh
you
laugh

how
many

what
ages

uh

you
've
been
through
the
fun
part

i
have
a
four
and
a
half
and
a
three

so
it
's

i
i
'm
sure
there
's
a
lot
of
differences
in
the
way
in
the
way
it
's
done
now
and
then

yeah

yeah

what
was
the
age
difference
between
the
youngest
and
the
oldest

so
they
were
all
real
close

that
's
tough

that
's
a
lot
of
time

did
you
both
work
your
wife
too

uh
well
qualify
that

she
worked
at
home
i
'm
sure

but
that
's
uh

well
both
my
husband
and
i
work

and
sometimes
i
feel
like
you
know
by
the
time
i
pick
them
up
and
get
them
home
and
get
them
fed
i
have
very
little
time
each
evening

maybe
thirty
minutes
max

and
well
he
spends
a
lot
of
time
with
them
while
i
'm
cooking

and
then
i
spend
time
with
them
while
you
know
he
's
doing
other
stuff

and
and
of
course
we
try
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
weekend

you
know
there
's
a
lot
of
times
my
house
may
not
be
as
clean
as
i
particularly
like
it

but
it
's
neat

it
's
straight

and
i
can
live
with
it
because
i
do
stuff
with
my
kids
you
know

well
i
've
accepted
that
too

that
's
true

it
is

yeah

that
's
true

well
that
's
true

and
and
we
do
a
lot
of
that
on
the
weekends
you
know

we
try
to
spend
saturdays
together

if
my
husband
golfs
you
know
he
'll
do
it
during
nap
time
things
like
that
where
they
're
not
really
missing
the
presence
you
know

and
and
we
do
a
lot
of
family
things
together

we
're
we
're
kind
of
going
the
other
direction
this
weekend

we
're
planning
a
trip
just
he
and
i

this
is
the
first
time
we
've
gone
anywhere
without
the
kids
since
she
was
born
four
and
a
half
years
ago

well
i
decided
that
you
know
you
need
that
once
in
awhile
that
you
you
need
to
plan
the
quality
time

and
and
i
do
think
that
if
you
plan
it
and
spend
that
and
make
it
quality
time
you
do
n't
have
to
be
there
twenty-four
hours
a
day

yeah

sure

sure

and
they
think
that
's
a
family
activity
you
know

yeah

that
's
great
fun

my
daughter
's
like
mommy
can
i
help
you
with
the
laundry

of
course
you
can

absolutely

yeah

uh-huh

and
what
would
you
do

what

oh

yeah

so
they
would
just
pick
whatever
issue
kind
of
was
at
a
head
that
week

and
then

oh

i
imagine

and
i
imagine
you
still
have
a
very
close
relationship
with
them

i

oh
that
's
wonderful

see
i
was
raised
in
that
type
of
family
where
you
know
you
do
n't
disobey
me
you
mind
me

but
if
you
have
a
problem
with
what
we
did
or
how
we
did
it
you
can
always
come
back
and
talk
to
me
about
it

yeah

uh-huh

uh
well

yeah

yeah

you
do
n't
think
of
it
that
way
do
you

now
that
's
good

i
like
that
idea

whatever
was
voted
on
huh

well
i
think
that
's
great

yeah

yeah

i
i
think
that
's
true

i
can
remember
times
my
parents
would
say
well
what
do
you
think
would
be
a
fair
punishment

and
we
would
always
come
up
with
something
that
was
harder
than
what
they
would
have
done
you
know

so
i
do
think
it
's
right
that
they
're
harder
on
themselves
you
know

oh
why
is
that

so
how
do
you
feel
about
it

yeah

i
i
myself
almost
uh
am
in
favor
of
it

uh
i
work
at
honeywell

and
i
went
through
a
a
pretty
i
do
n't
know
i
went
through
a
standard
drug
testing
thing
before
i
i
was
brought
on

i
think
that
's
pretty
standard

at
least
at
honeywell
it
is

uh
i
think
it
's
important
to
insure
the
quality
and
and
uh
i
do
n't
know
almost
the
goodness
of
character
you
know
that
kind
of
thing

where
do
you
work

oh
okay

oh
okay

huh

oh
great

right

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

and
that
that
definitely
happens
you
know

i
mean
those
the
drug
tests
sure
they
're
accurate

but
there
's
always
that
margin
of
error

and
that
's
that
's
something
to
be
aware
of

another
thing
is
a
lot
of
times
you
know
they
are
n't
that
accurate

they
are
n't
that
sensitive

like
if
you
're
on
a
prescription
drug
of
some
kind
you
know
what
are
they
going
to
do
about
that

you
know
i
was
on
a
couple
of
different
prescription
drugs
when
i
was
tested
for
honeywell

and
uh
uh
you
know
i
know
they
did
n't
catch
that
or
else
they
would
have
said
something

uh
i
'm
sure
they
screen
for
just
a
particular
few
types

although
the
literature
they
give
with
you
says
yeah
we
do
this

and
then
they
list
about
five
thousand
drugs
they
try
to
test
for

uh
i
do
n't
know

what
what
program
are
you
in
over
at
carnegie
mellon

oh
okay

great

uh
yeah

i
'm
a
graduate
student
at
u
c
f
in
florida
university
of
central
florida

and
this
is
actually
a
an
internship
up
here

but
uh
they
uh
even
for
interns
they
they
do
the
whole
random
drug
or
the
whole
drug
testing
thing

so

right

uh
they
essentially

no

i
sure
do
n't
uh

they
essentially
uh
they
essentially
uh
made
me
the
offer
and
then
and
then
uh
did
the
drug
testing
thing
after
that

so
uh
it
was
one
of
those
things
where
you
go
through
the
the
general
battery
of
all
their
tests

and
and
then
they
essentially
give
you
the
offer

and
then
at
that
point
they
'll
they
'll
ask
you
to
go
to
a
drug
testing
and
things
like
that

so
uh
there
's
some
noise
on
this
end

i
'm
actually
in
a
mall
calling

so

you
probably
wondered
huh

but

yes

that
's
a
good
question

i
believe
from
what
i
remember
of
the
literature
they
gave
uh
if
you
fail
i
believe
they
give
you
one
more
chance

they
probably
give
you
a
chance
to
explain
yourself
and
then
maybe
give
you
another
chance
to
go
through
it

but
uh
you
know
once
again
those
things
are
not
that
accurate

so
there
's
undoubtedly
a
proportion
of
people
who
do
fail
you
know

but
uh
wha-

are
you
working
right
now
anywhere

or

okay

oh
okay

great

yeah

that
was
the
first
time
i
'd
ever
gotten
any
kind
of
drug
screening
you
know
was
was
going
to
honeywell

a
friend
of
mine
is
also
a
doctoral
student
down
there

and
he
's
doing
an
internship
with
i
b
m

and
uh
they
basically
uh
did
the
same
exact
thing

uh
we
both
got
our
internships
at
the
same
time

and
we
both
had
to
go
through
drug
testing
at
the
same
time

so
one
of
those
things
where
we
went
through
a
kind
of
an
identical
process

but
uh

no

no

that
's
one
thing
they
do
n't
do
is
is
drug
testing
while
you
're
on
the
job

uh
i
think
i
think
the
unwritten
rule
is
yeah
expect
it

but
they
do
n't
do
it

you
know
so
that
's
good
i
guess

i
do
n't
know

i
mean
i
uh
i
have
gone
to
a
couple
of
parties
since
since
that
time

and
while
i
do
n't
do
any
drugs
myself
i
've
seen
some
people
who
work
there
uh
you
know
smoking
a
joint
or
whatever

and
uh
you
know
that
's
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
definitely
come
up
you
know

but
no

they
do
n't
they
do
n't
really
do
that

so

yeah

uh
i
i
do
n't
see
any
problem
with
with
testing
for
random
drugs

uh-huh

yeah

uh
well
i
'm
a
graduate
student
right
now
at
carnegie
mellon

and
i
i
just
came
from
saint
paul
uh
interviewing
with
three
m

and
uh
they
have
a
policy
for
uh
testing

if
you
if
they
make
you
an
offer
then
they
'll
test
you
right
before
you
start

and
i
guess
the
only
drawback
i
can
see
to
to
drug
testing
is
in
in
case
you
are
on
some
sort
of
medication
that
might
give
some
uh
sort
of
false
positive
result
then
there
could
be
some
sort
of
problem

but
i-

yeah

yeah

right

uh
electrical
engineering

oh
wow

they
test
you
uh
before
they
before
you
start
or
before
you
even
interview

or

uh-huh

oh

oh

yeah

wh-
what
happens
if
you
were
to
fail

then
do
they
give
you
like
one
ch-
one
more
chance
or
two
more
chances

uh-huh

uh
no

i
'm
just
about
to
finish
my
master
's
in
may
and
uh
just
interviewing
with
companies
right
now

uh-huh

oh

did
do
they
test
you
at
right
now
at
work
too

okay

oh

uh-huh

wow

is
it
formal
policy
that
they
said
they
might
test

so
um
how
do
you
feel
about
the
crime
in
your
city

is
it
uh

uh-huh

oh
really

uh-huh

oh
yeah

san
jose
california

here
you
know
the
real
problems
are
the
gangs

a
lot
of
gang
related
a
lot
of
murders
uh
just
in
general
the
whole

we
've
only
been
here
a
couple
of
years

uh
before
that
we
lived
in
colorado

but
in
comparison
to
colorado
it
's
real
noticeable

i
mean
you
can
just
feel
i
mean
i
can
just
sense

i
mean
i
wo
n't
even
i
wo
n't
go
to
the
grocery
store
at
night

you
know

and
it
it
's
that
kind
of
thing

and
uh

yeah

we
have
a
neighborhood
watch
program
in
the
house
uh
the
development
that
we
live
in
which
i
think
is
a
great
way
to
reduce
uh
home
theft
burglary
and
things
of
that
sort

do
you
have
that
where
you
live

or

uh-huh

oh
no

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

well
you
know
uh
also
i
've
heard
that
uh
the
newest
thing
is
a
lot
of
people
are
specializing
in
robbing
people
during
the
time
they
're
home
like
on
the
weekends

a
high
percentage
of
uh
free
time

i
think
it
's
like
fifty
percent
of
most
people
's
free
time
is
uh
spent
doing
yard
work
outdoors

so
they
wait
while
you
're
out
outdoors

they
know
the
house
is
unlocked

and
then
they
just
slip
in
slip
in
slip
out
you
know

they
know
exactly
what
they
're
going
for

so
i
've
heard
that
's
really
on
the
rise
as
far
as
uh
you
know
a
new
type
of
crime

yeah

unfortunately
yes

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

i
mean

yeah

it
helps
to
know
your
neighbors
you
know

they
give
you

you
're
supposed
to
make
lists
of
uh
cars

like
i
know
a
lot
of
my
neighbors
right
around
my
development
if
i
see
a
car
that
's
unfamiliar
we
we
have
a
list

is
that
what
you
you
did
in
your
program
where
you
have
a
list
of
license
plates

yeah

uh-huh

oh
uh-huh

yeah
well

uh-huh

i
mean
you
you
hate
to
be
paranoid

but
there
are
really
only
so
many
things
you
can
do

you
can
have
the
house
alarm
uh
neighborhood
watch
program
you
know
uh
as
a
woman
not
go
out
at
night

uh
you
can
do
that
which
is
what
i
choose
to
do

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

that
's

uh-huh

but
it
's
not
uh

if
you
kill
someone
in
your
home
as
long
as
they
are
in
your
home
it
's
considered
self-defense
though

it
is
n't

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

really

yeah

yeah

well
i
think
if
if
you
had
ha-
a
handgun
though
in
other
words
it
was
n't
premeditated
you
had
a
handgun
it
's
the
middle
of
the
night
someone
's
down-

well
um
minneapolis
is
n't
too
bad

uh
i
know
that
there
's
been
some
increases
in
crime
lately
in
terms
of
murders

uh
that
's
kind
of
gone
up
in
scale
and
and
some
other
things

uh
i
personally
had
a
little
experience
the
other
day

uh
somebody
broke
my
passenger
window
and
stole
a
uniform
out
of
my
truck

but
actually
you
know
when
you
look
at
at
minneapolis
as
compared
to
where
i
used
to
live
it
's
really
quite
a
bit
better
uh
because
i
came
from
florida

and
in
orlando
there
's
crime
is
getting
to
be
a
bigger
problem
than
ever

so

what
part
of
california
are
you
from

oh
really

i
have
a
good
friend
there

yeah

oh
yeah

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

that
's

that
's
really
a
shame
when
it
has
to
constrain
your
activities
like

sure

well
uh
interestingly
enough
right
before
i
moved
up
here

i
'm
an
intern

and
then
i
go
back
down
in
may

uh
but
in
orlando
before
i
moved
up
we
had
a
real
problem
with
it

uh
we
've
been
broken
into
in
my
apartment
about
four
times
in
like
two
and
a
half
weeks

and
one
of
the
things
that
i
i
helped
organize
was
a
neighborhood
watch
type
situation
down
there

uh
because
they
were
just

it
's
one
of
those
things
where
the
new
thing
is
that
they
operate
in
the
daylight
because
everybody
went
to
work
you
know

and
then
the
houses
were
left
unguarded
uh

but
yeah

i
think
given
that
people
are
pretty
conscientious
about
it

that
's
a
good
way
to
to
work
it
with
a
neighborhood
watch

oh
is
that
right

oh

that
's
amazing

yeah

uh

yeah

it
almost
seems
like
they
're
getting
quite
a
bit
smarter

really
you
know

yeah

unfortunately
it
's
starting
to
really
you
know
look
at
people
's
habits
and
where
they
are
at
particular
points
of
the
day

like
one
of
the
guys
i
work
with
really
laughs
when
he
looks
at
minneapolis
because
he
's
from
detroit

and
uh
the
the
crime
level
there
of
course
is
quite
a
bit
quite
a
bit
uh
more
pronounced
uh

but
uh
yeah

i
guess

i
think
we
've
got
a
neighborhood
watch
program
here
in
minneapolis

i
'm
not
real
sure
uh

pretty
much

yeah

i
was
i
was
basically
involved
in
that
in
the
organization
of
it

and
then
i
left
right
in
the
middle
of
it

i
'm
not
sure
where
we
went
from
there

but

yeah

that
that
whole
thing
of
being
alert
and
kind
of
noticing
your
surroundings
noticing
people
who
look
suspicious
uh
activities
like
that
sure

yeah

yeah

yeah

one
of
the
frustrating
things
about
that
is
that
you
really
are
limited

even
even
if
you
know
that
the
threat
is
there
it
's
against
the
law
to
set
traps

it
's
against
the
law
to
do
a
lot
of
things
you
know

they
could
basically
uh

when
i
was
getting
robbed
down
in
florida
i
was
really
considering
electrifying
doors
um
things
like
that
like

they
did
in
miami
that
time

that
's
not
always
true

no

there
was
a
there
was
a
case
about
two
years
ago
where
a
guy
knew
he
was
going
to
get
robbed

and
essentially
what
he
had
done
is
set
a
a
elec-
a
electrocution
trap
for
the
burglar
in
his
own
home

the
guy
came
in
while
he
was
home

and
sure
enough
he
fell
into
the
trap
and
was
severely
burned

he
did
n't
die

but
he
was
severely
burned

and
he
took
the
guy
to
court
and
won
a
settlement

yeah

so
that
really
that
makes
you
think
you
know

it
's
like
your
hands
are
re-
very
much
tied

uh
i
've
had
uh
three
boys
through
i
guess
uh
some
child
care
each
one
of
them

and
now
they
're
in
school

so
it
's
all
over

but
uh
i
guess
i
would
say
it
's
not
easy
to
find
wha-
what
most
parents
would
want

is
that
right

i
guess
uh
the
only
rule
uh
i
can
think
of
is
that
i
like
to
look
for
places
with
uh
good
respectable
nonprofit
behind
them
like
a
university
or
a
hospital
or
something
like
that

if
they
're
associated
with
a
college
or
a
university
they
're
usually
a
pretty
good
bet

uh
i
think
it
's
sort
of
the
opposite
of
what
you
would
want
when
you
buy
a
car
or
refrigerator
something

you
'd
like
to
get
it
from
some
good
cutthroat
capitalist
company
but
not
with
child
care

yeah

for
profit
places
i
would
really
look
at
them
awfully
carefully

but
uh
when
i
was
when
my
kids
were
young
i
was
teaching
at
a
university

and
uh
the
child
care
center
associated
with
our
university
was
quite
good

so
i
felt
confident
that
they
'd
do
right

oh
you
mean
uh
learning
type
uh
yeah
i
mean
actual
experiments
they
would
have
to
get
your
permission

but
yeah

i
suppose
uh
if
you
're
if
there
is
a
psychology
department
or
an
education
department
around
you
might
find
you
might
find
that
they
're
pushing
one
form
of
education
or
another

i
guess
that
's
true

but
uh
i
never
had
bad
experience
in
that
respect

of
course
you
also
tend
to
get
people
that
are
associated
with
the
university
and
the
hospital
as
the
parents

and
they
you
know

pretty
good
people

uh-huh

yeah

i
never
really
worry
very
much
about
it

i
tend
to
think
those
are
very
rare
but
quickly
exploited
and
made
public

so
i
never
really
worried
too
much
about
that
being
uh
uh
the
case
with
my
boys

uh
i
you
know
i
think
those
things
get
into
the
headlines
immediately
when
somebody
finds
out
about
them

but

i
do
n't
think
it
's
as
common
as
uh
the
newspapers
would
make
you
believe

oh
yeah

i
mean
that

right

well
in
our
case
we
made
the
decision
that
my
wife
would
stay
home
until
the
boys
were
uh
in
school

and
i
'm
really
happy
we
did
it
although
it
was
very
very
difficult

and
i
think
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do

and
we
were
uh
we
just
decided
that
we
would
do
it

and
we
went
ahead

but
uh
not
everybody
can
make
that
choice

and
even
even
though
my
wife
was
n't
working
we
did
have
uh
one
or
another
of
the
boys
in
uh
child
care
for
part-ti-
just
for
part
of
the
day
uh
or
a
couple
of
days
a
week
just
so
that
uh
other
things
could
get
done
around
the
house
and
so
on

so
so
we
did
look
around

i
think
my
wife
is
much
better
than
i
am
at
that
walking
into
a
place
and
getting
a
feeling
for
whether
it
is
a
loving
and
caring
place
or
not

and
uh
so
i
would
always
trust
her
judgment
on
that

uh-huh

there
's
absolutely
no
question
that
you
're
going
to
be
the
best
child
care
provider
for
that
kid

so
yeah
do
it
as
long
you
can

but
i
think
you
know
you
have
to
look
through
a
place

and
you
have
to
get
a
feel
for
uh
how
they
treat
the
kids
and
uh
uh
what
kind
of
staff
members
they
have
and
how
much
turnover
they
have
and
things
like
that
before
you
commit
your
child
to
them

and
i
think
you
have
the
main
thing
is
that
you
have
to
determine
that
they
're
perfectly
open
that
you
're
welcome
anytime
without
notice
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
so
forth

and
if
they
're
at
all
queasy
about
that
then
i
'd
look
elsewhere
yeah

right

you
have
other
friends
that
have
kids
uh
being
taken
care
of
in
uh
child
care

uh-huh

so
but
i
really
think
the
news
reports
are
uh
tend
to
sensationalize
the
problems

i
think
the
problems
are
more
ones
of
cost
and
resources
and
uh
pay
and
exhaustion
and
you
know
things
like
that
rather
than
these
uh
uh
really
wild
abuse
cases
that
you
read
about
because
it
make
good
copy

yeah

uh-huh
well

well
i
can
profit
by
this
because
i
'm
due
with
my
first
in
about
three
months

huh

i
guess
not

usu-

i
suppose
you
're
absolutely
right
there

uh-huh

uh-huh

of

are
n't
do
n't
they
kind
of
use
them
for
everybody
kind
of
use
them
for
guinea
pigs
for
their
per-
for
their
pet
theories
or
some
such
thing

yes

um
well
the
thing
i
really
worry
about
is
uh
the
sexual
abuse
cases
you
read
about

and
i
mean
you
'd
just
feel
awful
if
something
like
that
happened

uh-huh

oh

uh-huh

uh-huh

and
another
thing
is
cost

i
know
so
many
of
my
friends
i
went
to
school
with
who
are
having
babies
right
now

and
they
finding
in
some
cases
they
're
finding
it
's
just
not
worth
it
to
work
because
it
's
all
going
out
in
daycare

um

um

huh

huh

huh
well
i
'm
just
thanking
heaven

my
husband
just
got
a
new
job

his
last
company
he
was
only
working
four
days
a
week

so
it
's

and
he
just
got
a
new
job

he
's
getting
lots
of
overtime

he
got
a
pay
raise

and
so
i
'm
just
grateful
that
we
do
n't
have
to
worry
so
much
about
my
working
or
not

i
suppose

uh-huh

uh-huh

you
have
to
start
wondering
if
they
do
n't
want
you

yes

huh

uh
i
have
one

but
i
have
n't
really
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
her
about
that
for
a
while

uh-huh

this
is
true

current
affair
can
get
several
shows
child
cases

why
do
n't
you
go
ahead
and
start

so
you
think
if
if
trials
were
held
by
judges
or
experts
that
they
they
would
tend
not
to
uh
admit
not
to
convict
people
on
circumstantial
evidence

you
know
i
i
attended
a
trial
in
uh
germany
when
i
was
a
student

and
uh
that
's
the
sort
of
system
they
have

the
trials
are
held
by
a
panel
of
three
uh
three
or
four
judges
who
are
well

they
're
like
lawyers
i
guess

they
're
experts
in
the
law

and
uh
there
there
really
is
n't
a
jury

and
uh
uh
they
do
the
questioning
also

the
judges
do
the
questioning

and
uh
they

uh
i-

i
think
it
's
a
lot
harder
to
get
off
on
technicalities
also
because
they
uh
uh
the
judge
is
also
sort
of
a
jury
uh

but
i
'm
not
sure
i
like
that

i
think
i
prefer
the
jury
system
myself

uh
well
actually
i
think
in
most
criminal
cases
it
would
n't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
couple
of
judges
or
jury

what
what
i
worry
about
is
cases
where
it
's
the
government
against
the
individual

that
's
where
you
really
need
a
jury
of
peers
because
uh
anytime
th-
the
government
uh
is
the
government
against
the
individual
you
need
som-
y-
you
need
the
protection
of
ordinary
citizens

i
think
that
's
really
the
only
thing
i
guess
where
i
would
like
to
see
the
system
change
is
uh
uh
there
ought
to
be
a
a
well

i
guess
i
do
n't
think
that
uh
uh
juries
need
to
decide
sentencing
all
the
time

i
think
maybe
th-
a
judge
is
a
better
judge
of
that

or
uh

yeah

well
if
you
drag
twelve
people
into
a
courtroom
i
trust
them
to
make
the
right
decision
as
to
whether
someone
's
guilty
or
innocent

that
's
usually
a
matter
of
who
to
believe
and
what
facts
to
believe

but
people
who
d-
do
n't
have
day
in
and
day
out
life
long
experience
with
what
prison
is
really
like
and
what
the
options
are
to
ask
them
to
decide
for
one
case
on
one
person
based
on
what
they
see
i
think
that
is
maybe
uh
a
little
bit
naive

in
texas
here
people
tend
to
get
whipped
up
into
a
frenzy
and
slap
long
sentences
on
people

uh
it
's
kind
of
uh
uh
a
hanging
jury
atmosphere

but
in
a
lot
of
places
i
think
people
bend
over
the
other
way

but
i
guess
i
guess
i
like
the
system
that
they
have
in
some
places
where
the
defendant
gets
to
choose
whether
he
's
goes
before
a
jury
for
sentencing
or
whether
the
judge
gets
to
choose
it

some
some
cases
in
some
jurisdictions
they
can
do
that

i
kind
of
like
that
system

yeah

yeah

yeah

right

and
lawyers
blow
sand
in
their
eyes

i
would
like
to
see
most
civil
cases
tried
before
a
panel
of
experts
instead
of
ordinary
juries

insurance
cases
and
things
like
that

where

and
uh
there
would
be
more
honest
settlements
instead
of
this
uh
tugging
of
people
's
heart
strings
and
uh
making
them
cry
and
feel
like
they
're
doing
somebody
good
by
giving
them
or
giving
them
two
million
dollars
to
make
up
for
the
pain
and
suffering

so
in
i
think
i-
in
criminal
trials
you
need
the
jury
as
a
defense
against
the
government

but

okay

well
i
think
the
court
systems
could
stand
some
improvement

uh
trial
by
jury
is
good

but
a
lot
of
time
i-
a
lot
of
cases
uh
is
circumstantial
evidence
that
that
convicts
a
person
which
i
do
n't
think
is
all
the
time
good
because
sometimes
it
's
hard
to
get
all
the
facts
and
to
prove
a
person
innocent
i
mean
prove
a
person
guilty
if
you
do
n't
really
know
or
you
do
n't
really
have
an
eyewitness

and
how
can
you
convict
somebody
on
circumstantial
evidence
is
beyond
me

i
do
n't
know

i
think
so

uh-huh

right

uh-huh

you
think
you
prefer
the
jury

you
think
your
chances
are
better

well
that
's
true

uh-huh

well
s-
sometimes
the
sentencing
is
still
is
not
fair

i
mean
even
if
well
the
jury
i
guess
they
do
decide
that

but
but
i
'm
like
you

in
a
case
like
that
most
of
the
time
its

i
do
n't
know

maybe
i
'm
too
too
uh
uh
conservative
when
it
comes
to
that

th-
the
sentencing
is
really
light
compared
to
what
i
think
they
should
be
in
a
lot
of
cases
you
know
uh

right

yeah

uh-huh

right

oh
really

yeah

that
's
that
's
not
a
bad
system

but
i
i
do
think
it
needs
to
be
shaken
up
a
little
bit

but
the
thing
is
too
maybe
they
need
more
of
a
i
do
n't
know
more
of
a
expert
types
to
to
be
on
some
of
these
jury
cases
because
most
time
you
just
pick
you
know
joe
blow
or
whoever
and
a
good
citizen
or
whoever
an-
and
call
them
in

exactly

right

exactly

yeah

uh-huh
put-
putting
on
a
act
or
whatever

uh-huh

exactly

exactly

have
you
had
that
experience
recently

oh
yeah

oh

well
i
do
n't
have
so
much
trouble
with
products
as
service

i
do
n't
feel
like
that
's
as
big
a
problem

i
've
had
a
few
answering
machines
over
the
last
two
years
just
because
i
've
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
them
working
correctly

and
i
'm
not
convinced
that
any
of
them
work
a
hundred
percent

uh
the
one
i
have
now
is
okay
most
of
the
time

but
that
's
it

but
that
's
that
's
probably
the
worst

my
daughter
has
a
charm
bracelet
i
bought
her
that
's
guaranteed
uh
james
avery

i
do
n't
know
if
you
have
that
up
there

but
it
it
's
a
very
good
company
that
sells
sterling
silver
things

and
uh
she
has
a
charm
bracelet
with
lots
of
charms
on
it
a
lot
of
money
into
it
by
now

and
the
catch
broke

and
she
was
sitting
in
school
on
a
carpet

and
when
she
stood
up
it
caught
and
broke

and
we
took
it
back

and
they
said
oh
this
was
just
obviously
yanked

this
was
yanked

i
mean
they
were
so
rude
about
it

and
so
we
wanted
a
different
kind
of
catch

and
she
said
well
it
's
not
guaranteed

and
i
said
well
put
it
on
because
apparently
nothing
's
guaranteed

so
do
it
anyway

so
we
got
the
kind
we
wanted

and
i
was
really
disappointed
with
that

i
felt
that
this
was
a
company
that
should
have
been
more
reliable

and
i
happened
to
need
a
birthday
present
for
one
of
her
friends

and
i
called
there
to
see
if
they
had
it

and
the
lady
was
very
nice

and
i
said
my
goodness

i
said
you
've
been
very
nice
what
's
your
name

and
she
told
me

and
i
said
well
i
really
appreciate
it

i
said
there
seems
to
be
a
big
attitude
problem
in
that
store

and
it
turned
out
she
was
the
assistant
manager

so

right

so
i
felt
kind
of
good
about
that
you
know

i
did
n't
even
know
the
person
's
name
that
had
given
me
the
hard
time
or
anything

but
i
just
felt
like
well
at
least
i
did
something

maybe
they
'll
fix
it

they
might
work
on
that
you
know

but
i
find
attitudes
are
more
of
a
problem

service
is
more
of
a
problem

really

that
's
really
great

huh

that
's
really
good

it
use
to
be
like
that

but

i
do
n't
think
most
places
are
like
that
anymore

recently
i
ca
n't
really
say
recently

but
i
think
about
uh
about
a
year
ago
uh
i
bought
a
product
from
some
company
down
at
uh
in
atlanta
georgia

i
believe
it
was
one
of
these
uh
one
of
these
uh
mixers
these
like
these
juice
machines

and
uh
the
uh
the
blade
they
sent
me
at
first
that
went
into
the
machine
it
looked
you
know
perfectly
okay

but
i
found
that
uh
it
was
made
of
some
material
which
actually
ended
up
rusting
uh
after

even
despite
you
know
diligent
washing
it
it
got
rusty
after
about
uh
three
weeks
of
use

and
i
do
n't
think
it
was
my
fault
because
i-
i
you
know
i
had
made
a
point
of
like
drying
it
off
and
cleaning
it

but
uh
it
was
really
uh
it
was

i
had
to
send
it
back
after
like
you
know
the
third
week
because
i
realized
it
was
like
it
was
not

something
was
very
very
wrong
with
the
blade

uh
what
about
you

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
at
least
your
talking
to
somebody
who
counts

uh-huh

right

right

right

i
find

up
here
in
the
northeast
we
have
uh
well
w-
we
have
these
mail
order
companies
like
l
l
bean

and
uh
they
are
famous
for
i
guess
having
really
top-notch
service

they
've
got
uh

i
mean
i
've
i
've
i
i
have
friends
and
family
who
order
from
them
because
you
can
you
can
literally
i
've
heard
stories
where
you
can
literally
buy
something
from
them
one
year
wear
it
for
a
year
and
a
half

and
even
after
like
eighteen
months
of
you
know
reasonably
satisfactory
use
they
will
accept
it
in
any
condition

and
they
will
gladly
no
questions
asked
take
it
back
if
for
some
bizarre
reason
you
decide
you
do
n't
want
it
anymore

uh
they
'll
they
'll
actually
do
things
like
this

i
mean
they
're
really
they
they
go-
bend
over
backwards
service
wise
for
you

i
've
uh
i
've
found
also
a
lot
of
companies
nowadays
have
they
have
eight
hundred
numbers
you
can
call

i
guess
if
if
you
call
the
e-
any
eight
hundred
number
uh
if
you
you
can
call
up
e-
any
eight
hundred
number
directory
assistance
and
you
can
get
uh
the
eight
hundred
number
of
the
customer
service
support
line
for
a
number
of
companies

and
um
actually
i
've
tried
that
with
a
few
companies
lately

and
they
've
most
of
them
have
been
pretty
good

but
i
i
was

one
reason
why
i
like
i
buy
a
lot
of
clothing
through
mail
order
is
that
uh
if
you
buy
through
bean
or
though

uh
i
guess
bean
's
one
of
bean
's
big
competitors
is
land
's
end
out
in
uh
i
guess
it
's
wisconsin
somewhere

they
they
are
uh
they
're
very
good
about
uh
insur-

like
the
customer
is
always
right

and
you
know
no
matter
how
crabby
you
might
be
over
the
phone
they
are
very
understanding

and
uh
they
usually
get
you
know
they
they
make
things
are
they
ma-
make
sure
things
are
set
properly
if
you
're
any
way
dissatisfied
with
their
merchandise

uh-huh

yeah

well
i
think
i
guess
nowadays
with
the
uh
with
the
economy
the
way
it
is
i
guess

there
was
a
there
was
a
story
on
the
news
tonight
about
how
because
a
lot
of
companies
are
uh
you
know

things
are
getting
rough
out
there

there
's
a
lot
of
you
know

the
morale
among
employees
tends
to
go
down
and
that
in
turn
like
you
know

well
th-
the
question
was
talking
about
the
juries

and
uh
one
of
the
things
i
thought
about
was
a
lot
of
the
drunk
cases
that
they
were
having
that
especially
for
repeat
offenders
that
uh

maybe
there
should
be
stiffer
penalties
for
those
people
who
come
back
again
and
again

uh
so
that
uh
a
judge
i
think
would
be
the
most
appropriate
person
to
uh
to
be
able
to
sentence
somebody
since
they
do
it
over
and
over
again
every
day

right

right

uh-huh

yeah

see
i
agree
with
you

uh
one
thing
i
heard
was
this
where
they
have
instead
of
going
to
the
regular
court
they
have
a
a
mock
court

i
mean
it
's
supposed
to
be
all
legal
and
everything

uh
you
go

and
you
present
your
case

the
other
side
presents
their
case

and
you
're
done
with
it

it
's
almost
like
the
night
court
we
see
on
t
v

uh
and
uh
but
it
's
not
that
we
have
uh
such

it
did
n't
backlog
or
all
of
the
uh
the
cases
that
are
uh
all
ready
pending

uh
so
i

that
was
one
thing
i
thought
about
that
would
be
really
neat
if
we
could
do
it
that
way

yes

yes

now

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

oh
yes

and
and
i
was
n't
i
did
n't
mean
that

i
i
did
n't
mean
that
no

because
i
mean
gee
whiz
if
i
was
uh
uh
did
n't
have
that
right
you
know
not
to
have
a
jury
that
oh

yes
i
would
feel
uh
you
're
right
that
my
civil
rights
had
been
violated

but
i
meant
for
some
when
both
parties
agreed
that
yes
we
're
going
to
have
a
judge
here

we
're
not
going
to
have
a
jury
you
know

let
's
get
it
over
with

sort
of
like
car
accidents
you
know

yeah

right

right

uh-huh

right

giving
a
different
sentence

uh-huh

the
take

right

well
i
i
i-
we
're
at
liberty
to
to
talk
and
and
meander
as
long
as
it
's
all
on
the
same
theme

uh-huh

right

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

right

yeah

bu-
well
you
can
tell
i
have
n't
been
in
too
many
juries
judges
chambers
or
anything
like
that

n-

well
i
was
called
once
when
i
was
nineteen

and
uh
but
i
was
doing
so
many
other
things
that
they
took
pity
on
me

and
i
was
doing
school
and
things
like

they
they
let
me
out

an-
i
've
never
had
to
it
since

and
that
was
almost
twenty
years
ago

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

how
interesting

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

i
i
kind
of
agree
with
that
because
i
think
in
some
cases
uh
the
jury
may
not
even
have
the
information
about
other
crimes
the
person
has
committed

uh
i
i
think
that
in
some
cases
that
's
considered
to
prejudice
the
current
case

so
a
judge
you
're
right
should
have
the
whole
dossier
of
the
criminal
there

and
if
they
're
judged
guilty
would
probably
be
in
a
better
pri-
position
to
give
an
appropriate
uh
sentencing

uh-huh

in
other
words
not
not

there
would
be
some
types
of
crimes
for
which
you
're
not
guaranteed
a
jury
trial

i
i
i
do
n't

th-
there
's
a
point
on
which
we
do
n't
agree

i
would
tend
myself
to
say
that
we
should
continue
to
guarantee
a
jury
trial
for
criminal
cases
anytime
a
anytime
a
one
of
the
parties
wants
one

and
i
usually
it
is
the
defendant
i
guess
that
wants
to
have
the
jury
hear
the
case

so
i
'm
not
out
for
streamlining
things
to
the
point
where
we
uh
take
that
you
know

that
would
require
a
change
in
the
bill
of
rights
i
believe

and
so

oh
oh
okay

right

well
i
think
that
's
all
ready
possible

i
think
that
you
can
waive
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
uh

yeah

so
i
agree
that
that
should
be
encouraged

people
should
know
that
that
's
an
option
just
in
case
they
feel
they
have
to
have
a
jury
trial

but
i
think
most
lawyers
do
a
pretty
good
job
of
making
that
evident
to
to
clients
unless
they
feel
they
can
you
know
tweak
a
jury
into
per-
giving
a
different
sentence
or
possibly
if
it
's
a
civil
case
giving
higher
uh
you
know
awards
of
money
or
something
since
usually
the
lawyers
get
a
percentage
of
the
the
award

yeah

and
i
suspect
it
in
cases
like

i
guess
we
were
supposed
to
be
doing
criminals
though
rather
than
civil

is
that
right

yeah

well
uh
in
the
case
of
civil
uh
things
i
think
maybe
the
the
use
of
the
jury
is
very
often
to
the
lawyer
's
advantage

and
i
think
that
may
be
where
jury
use
is
overdone

i
mean
there
are
cases
where
they
could
be
settled
maybe
out
of
court
a
little
more
efficiently

but
the
lawyers
are
really
uh

it
's
to
their
advantage
to
play
to
as
big
an
audience
as
possible

so
uh
i
was
wondering
too
if
they
were
thinking
of
about
the
judge
making
awards
in
civil
cases
not
just
sentencing
in
in
a
criminal
cases

uh
i
'm
not
so
sure
i
'm
in
favor
of
that

but
i
am
in
favor
of
it
for
criminal
cases

so
there
's
a
difference
of
my
view
there
for
those
two

have
you
ever
had
to
serve
jury
duty

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

it
is
n't

sort
of
amazed
me
they
first
caught
up
with
me
for
the
first
time
in
uh

that
would
have
been
about
uh
twenty
years
too

uh
uh
just
last
year

and
uh
the
case
i
heard
was
a
criminal
case

and
it
seemed
it
really
trivial

it
involved
two
bicycles

we
did
n't
do
the
sentencing

the
judge
did

so

we
we
a-
rendered
a
verdict

and
then
the
judge
was
the
one
to
do
the
sentencing

and
that
was
here
in
wisconsin

so
i
i
do
n't
know
if
that
varies
from
state
to
state
or
if
it

i
'm
nevin
from
sunnyvale
california

pretty
good

yep

okay

well
i
definitely
think
like
decisions
have
to
be
unanimous

it
's
probably
the
safest
thing

yep

no

and
even
like
you
know
two-thirds
majority
i
mean
it
's

yep

yeah

yeah

like
gives
them
a
little
too
much
power

plus
you
know
you
may
be
you
know
doing
you
know
a
a
guilty
verdict

but
it
may
not
be
you
know
it
may
be
for
technical
reasons

yeah

i
know

yeah

it

there
would
be
much
more
of
that

no

but
i
i
tend
to
follow
it
just
to
just
to
know
what
's
going
on

yeah

i
do
too

so

no

yeah

i
know
a
little
more
about
civil
cases
when
than
criminal
cases
which
is

it
's
more
in
how
you
present
it
versus
you
know
who
's
right

yep

i
know

when
i
was
a
couple
of
years
ago
involved
in
some
pretrial
stuff
and

like
you
know
you
go
say
okay
we
ca
n't
bring
up
this
point
because
then
they
're
going
to
you
know

the
opposition
will
say
this
this
and
this
and

yep

and
it
's
like
the
the
truth
is
n't
really
important
anymore

it
's

yep

that
sounds
like
a
little
abuse
of
our
system

but

yeah

but
it
's
for
the
more
general

people
do
n't
want
to
take
responsibility

you
know
it
's

yep

uh
yeah

well
originally
from
chicago

but

i
really

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

i
have
n't
either
other
than

yeah

i
'm
not
really
sure
how
we
could
change
the
legal
system
to
make
it
better

i
know

yeah

and
if
it
's
criminal
cases
we
you
ca
n't
put
them
in
jail
because
there
's
no
room
left

yeah

huh

not
at
all

hi

this
is
jim
bliss
from
minneapolis
minnesota

how
you
doing

good

uh
i
guess
the
topic
is
trial
by
jury
and
how
we
should
change
that
or
how
we
would
change
it

uh
i
'm
ready
whenever
you
are

so
uh
what
are
your
what
are
your
thoughts
on
the
subject
there

yeah

yeah

i
think
that
's
probably
a
good
thing

yeah

i
mean
it
's
to
easy
to
get
a
quorum

and
simple
majority
wo
n't
do

yeah

that
's

yeah

quorums
are
to
easy
to
get

and
there
's
always
that
that
chance
that
one
or
two
people
could
be
playing
devil
's
advocate
for
a
good
reason
you
know

so
it
's
it
's

definitely

but
uh
i
do
n't
know

i
could
i
could
n't
believe
they
suggested
that
judges
should
be
doing
the
sentencing

yeah

tha-

i
i
know
of
a
couple
of
people
at
least
who
would
be
arguing
with
that
or
arguing
against
that
pretty
vehemently

but
uh

yeah

about
the
only
good
thing
i
would
say
about
that
is
it
w-
that
it
would
uh
hurry
the
process
up
a
bit

but
i
mean
even
now
we
've
got
i
know
we
've
got
plenty
of
cases
out
there
where
people
have
been
wrongly
convicted
and
things
like
that

and
that
's
what
the
trial
by
jury

i
mean
jeez
if
if
the
judge
was
doing
it
himself
without
any
checks
and
balances
whose
to
say

yeah

no
doubt

are
you
involved
in
the
legal
system
at
all

okay

yeah

yeah

i
've
got
some
friends
that
are
lawyers

so

one
of
them
just
got
his
law
degree

but
uh
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
'm
not
real
familiar
with
uh
the
system
of
juris-
jurisprudence
the
way
it
is
right
now

i
really
have
n't
studied
it
in
depth

yeah

i
'm
sure
of
it

because
a
lot
of
those
things
it
's
all
it
's
in
it
's
largely
a
matter
of
viewpoint
and
who
can
argue
their
case
better

uh
it
's
kind
of
weird

i
do
n't
know

you
i
always
think
about
watching
the
people
's
court
or
something
and
how
weird
those
cases
get

it
's
just

yeah

uh-huh

and
it
's
like
boy
the
stuff
that
they
can
twist
around
is

it
's
pretty
amazing

yeah

it
's
not

and
then
you
get
people
who
who
bring
in
cases
just
because
they
want
to
bring
them
up
just
because

like
this
this
friend
of
mine
's
pretty
obnoxious

and
he
really
gets
into
suing
people

and
so
he
'll
he
'll
sue
just
about
anybody
just
for
the
chance
to
get
into
court
and
argue
his
case
you
know

it
's
like
it
is
it
's
it
's
wasting
people
's
time
and
the
taxpayers'
money
and
everything
else

but
uh

yeah

and
and
most
of
the
time
they
're
looking
to
place
blame
uh
and
stuff

see
you
're
from
california

is
that
right

oh
okay

i
was
just
thinking

i
wonder
i
wonder
how
how
the
civil
system
or
the
court
system
must
differ
between
there
and
say
where
i
am
in
minneapolis

from
what
i
understand
it
's
all
pretty
the
same
except
when
you
get
to
louisiana

and
louisiana
is
completely
different
cause
it
was
based
on
the

what
is
it

it
's
based
on
common
law

and
the
rest
of
the
country
is
not
or
something
like
that

pretty
strange

but
uh
fortunately
i
never
have
had
to
go
in
even
even
for
jury
duty

but
uh
that
friend
of
mine
's
telling
me
that
i
might
have
to
go
in
for
uh
as
a
witness

he
may
subpoena
me

so
we
'll
see
what
happens

but
uh

yeah

it
's

there
are
too
many
big
problems
you
know

there
's
there
's
such
a
backlog
of
court
cases
right
now
you
know
to
try
to
get
them
all
in
in
a
good
time

and
we
already
have
too
many
lawyers
as
it
is

yeah

yeah

that
's
true

and
in
fact
they
're
even
letting
some
go

i
i
i
'm
originally
from
florida

and
it
's
like
it
seems
like
every
year
they
let
out
more
and
more
just
cause
they
do
n't
have
room
for
them
you
know

that
's
not
a
that
's
not
a
good
solution
either

i
'm
not
real
sure
what
the

what
do
you
think
about
capital
punishment

yeah

which
crimes
do
you
feel
that

yeah

because
of

so
many
times
it
's
so
brutal
and
just
recurrent

selling
i
think
should
also

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

that
's

go
ahead

texas
is
too

texas
i
saw
on
t
v
the
other
night
is
the
has
had
forty-six
in
like
the
past
several
years

so
they
're
pretty
hip
on
it
too
i
guess

they
do
it
by
lethal
injection
at
huntsville

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

that
's
what
's
happening
here

there
is

like
uh
that
's

in
fact
a
big
gubernatorial
issue
is
the
the
turnover
rates
of
uh
r-
uh
repeat
offenders
being
let
out
and
doing
it
again

uh-huh

yeah

i
wish
if
they
were
going
to
do
it
they
would
be
a
little
more
consistent
in
dealing
with
who
gets
lethal
injection
and
who
does
n't

be
a
little
more
you
know

not
being
able
to
put
it
off
for
fifteen
years

oh
really

goodness

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

i
yeah
i
tend
to
think
the
repeal
system
for
the
death
penalty
is
a
little
little
too
lenient

uh
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
significance
of
the
death
penalty

i
'm
a
graduate
student
at
the
university
of
texas
in
dallas

uh
audiology

yeah

what
do
you
do

oh
really

oh
really

neat

yeah

i
just

this
was
in
conjunction
with
the
guy
that
was
put
in
the
gas
chamber
in
california

so
i
think
it

the
forty-sixth
in
the
last
twenty-five
years
i
think
is
what

they
gave
a
run
down
that
texas
texas
tends
to
be
a
little
more
robust
and
disciplined
area
then

yeah

uh
they
they
do
n't
get
repealed
as
easily
as
they
do

like
the
guy
in
california
got
thir-
you
know
twice
before
he
went
to
the
gas
chamber

and
then
they
said
okay
no

you
do
n't
have
to
go

and
then
they
took
him
back

i
mean
it
just
seems
yeah
it
just
seemed
a
little
inconsistent

and
then
you
have
like
two

you
have
these
people
who
are
serial
killers
that
did
n't
even
get
the
death
sentence
back
when
ever
you
know

no

i
do
n't
i
do
n't
think
uh
the
military
does
n't
execute
anymore

so

or
death
before
the
firing
squad
or
whatever

so
i
think
about
the
only
one
is
uh
rape

well
i
'm
kind
of
in
favor
of
it
for
certain
crimes

well
i
think
first
degree
murder
uh
probably
warrants
it

right

exactly

recurrent
crimes
like
serial
rapists
or
serial
murderers
or
whatever

i
come
from
a
state
that
has
well
i
originally
come
from
the
state
that
has
uh
the
death
penalty

i
come
from
florida

and
uh
they
're
pretty
liberal
on
it

they
tend
to
like
fry
people
left
and
right
which

go
ahead

yeah

yeah

okay

i
think
florida
still
uses
electric
chair

uh
i
do
n't
i
do
n't
know

in
some
ways
i
do
n't
like
it
because
it
's
like
they
're
playing
god

and
that
's
not

i
do
n't
think
that
's
right

but
on
the
other
hand
there
's
a
lot
of
advantages
to
it

i
think
crime
rates
deterred
a
little
bit
by
using
it

and
of
course
you
have
some
savings
in
terms
of
taxpayer
money
keeping
people
in
jail
or
not
um

with
florida
that
's
a
big
problem
because
there
's
so
many
people
in
jail
that
they
have
to
let
them
out
every
year

they

uh-huh

sure

and
it
's
like
you
know
that
's
a
big
problem

but
there
's
not
a
whole
lot
you
can
do
about
it
because
there
's
only
so
many
jails
you
can
build

and
it
's
really
you
know
it
's
it
gets
to
be
a
r-
a
big
problem

uh
go
ahead

right

uh-huh

yeah

because
a
lot
of
these
guys
you
know
they
get
in

and
they
they
get
off
for
good
behavior

and
i
do
n't
know

up
in
minnesota
where
i
am
now
they
do
n't
have
the
death
penalty

and
you
can
almost
sense
that
people
are
just
laughing
at
the
system
you
know
because
they
figure
well
you
know
sure
i
i
get
thirty
or
forty
years
for
maybe
rape
or
something

uh
but
then
for

if
i
if
i
elicit
good
behavior
i
'm
out
in
maybe
five
or
ten

oh
sure
you
know

i
mean
just
because
like
we
said
before
they
do
n't
have
enough
room
in
the
jails
uh
you
know
there
's
a
lot
of
incentive
for
them
to
be
let
out
early

but
if
you
've
got
the
death
penalty
hanging
over
your
head
uh

i
do
n't
know

i
think
that
may
solve
a
lot
of
that

maybe
not
solve
it

but
i
do
n't
know

maybe

yeah

uh-huh

what
do
you
do
georgeanne

oh
okay

great

what
program
you
in

okay

fantastic
uh

i
'm
a
doctoral
student
at
the
university
of
central
florida

yeah

i
'm
doing
an
internship
up
at
honeywell

uh
yeah

but
uh
i
do
n't
know

it
's
it
's
an
interesting
issue

there
's
like
you
say
in
texas
there
's
been
quite
a
few

and
and
in
florida
in
the
last
few
years
i
think
there
's
been
a
lot

i
ca
n't
i
you
know
i
ca
n't
give
you
figures

but
uh

uh-huh

oh
is
that
right

okay

yeah

i
i
kind
of

yeah
i
've
heard
things
about
that

i
've
heard
that
they
do
n't
mess
around
very
much

uh-huh

jeez

that
's
a
lot
of
repeals

uh-huh

yeah

i
do
n't
know

i
i
'm
trying
to
think
about
other
crimes
that
would
warrant
it

uh
i
guess

what
is
it
what
's
the
policy
now
with
treason

do
they
uh
do
they
axe
you
for
treason
or
is
it
a
life
sentence

yeah

yeah

okay

i
'm
here

how
do
you
feel
about
public
schools

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

right

uh-huh

well
that
's
interesting

i
have
a
sister
who
used
to
live
in
kennesaw
georgia

and
uh
she
has
a
young
boy
actually
has
two
boys
now
but
only
had
one
when
she
was
there

and
she
complained
quite
a
bit
about
their
school
system
there

and

right

right

i
'm

i
ca
n't
really
say
much
about
the
schools
up
here

i
really
do
n't
come
from
here

i
'm
only
up
here
temporarily
on
an
internship

but
uh
i
live
in
orlando
florida
usually

and
the
schools
down
there
from
what
i
know
are
not
bad

they
're
pretty
good

but
i
know
that
in
some
i
know
in
a
lot
of
rural
areas
they
're
not
that
good

for
example
i
have
a
brother
in
north
carolina

and
he
says
the
schools
there
are
are
incredibly
bad
uh
just
terrible

huh

wow

that
is
slow

uh-huh

what
do
you
think
's
wrong
to
cause
that

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

perhaps

yeah

yeah

yeah

that
's
that
's
one
thing
i
worry
about

there
you
go

uh-huh

yeah

probably
quite
a
few
black
people
up
there

and
and

oh
is
that
right

oh
okay

yeah

but
you
know
it
it
's

you
do
n't
want
to
seem
racist
or
prejudice
or
whatever

but
then
again

yeah

there
is
no
denying
that
that

sure
you
know

teachers
you
have
to
admit
that
teachers
have
to
slow
things
down
for
people
who
do
n't
understand
especially
if
there
's
not
a
very
well
developed
special
education
program
at
the
school

that
's
right

you
ca
n't
do
that

right

see
i
grew
up
in
nebraska

and
the
school
that
i
went
to
there
was
fantastic

it

i
i
really
consider
myself
very
very
lucky

uh
we
had
a
school
that
had
classes
probably
about
the
same
size
you
're
talking
twenty-seven
thirty
kids
to
sc-
to
a
class

but

yeah

we
zipped
right
along
you
know

i
i
was
i
was
doing
mathematics
fractions
and
division
and
multiplication
by
the
third
grade
easily

uh

uh-huh

but
you
're
right
you
know

with
all
this
do
n't
hurt
the
kids
and
do
n't
abuse
their
rights
you
've
also
taken
something
away
from
the
discipline
i
think

yeah

right

i
was
going
to
ask
you
if
there
if
that
was
an
option

well
our
public
schools
are
are
really
poor
i
feel

uh
i
'm
not
sure
where
georgia
ranks
in
the
nation

but
uh
we
're
toward
the
bottom

and
uh
there
's
a
lot
of
things
that
i
see
that
are
so
obviously
wrong
that
you
would
think
it
would
be
easy
to
correct

but
the
system
does
n't
allow
for
the
corrections

how
about
you

oh
yes

yes

and
cobb
county
is
better
than
the
county
i
'm
in

she
was
in
cobb
county

uh-huh

okay

well
that
's
great

uh-huh

well
i
feel
that
we
're
way
behind

uh
i
have
a
son
that
is
in
the
fourth
grade

and
uh
they
have
just
now
taken
up
division

yeah

and

uh
i-

e-

my
husband
and
i
go
to
the
store

and
we
buy
these
math
books
and
fractions
and
multiplication
division
things

and
i
feel
like
uh
there
are
several
areas
that
we
're
just
really
really
slow
in

and
uh
i
do
n't
blame
the
teachers
as
much
as
i
blame
the
system

it
is

well
well
for
one
thing
there
's
not
enough
money
in
the
school
system

and
the
money
they
do
have
they
're
not
they
do
not
use
it
wisely

uh
she
my
son
's
teacher
has
twenty-seven
students

and
that
's
certainly
is
a
lot
of
students
for
one
person
to
deal
with
on
an
every
day
basis
uh

but
more
than
that
i
do
n't
think
that
they
have
the
authority
to
command
the
attention
of
the
children

and
when
you
have
two
kids
in
that
class
that
constantly
keeps
ca-
the
class
in
an
uproar
and
you
're
not
at
liberty
to
do
something
about
it
other
than
give
them
on
campus
isolation
or
send
them
to
the
principal
's
office
it
it
you
know
it
can
it
can
really
be
bad

uh
also
i
think
we
have
a
lot
of
uh
hispanics

and
we
have
a
lot
of
uh

the
county
i
am
i
'm
in
the
minorities
are
mostly
hispanic

no

we
're
from
a
county
we
're
from
the
county
they
marched
in

we
're
in
forsyth
county

yes

and
we

and
there
's
very
very
few
blacks

uh
so
so
that
's
uh

i
i
hate
to
say
uh

it
's
not
a
problem
uh
because
i
hate
to
feel
like
they
are
a
problem
although
they
are

but
it
is
a
problem
uh
especially
in
the
inner
schools
inner
city

well

and
you
ca
n't
put
all
the
children
in
special
education

uh
and
if
the
parents
do
not
care
enough
to
take
an
interest
in
whether
the
homework
is
done
you
know

uh-huh

yeah

but
your
teacher
had
control

uh-huh

yeah

i
i
believe
i
was
too

uh-huh

uh
well
it
it
really
is
a
concern
of
mine
because
if
we
could
afford
it
my
son
would
be
in
private
school

we
just
cannot
afford
it

uh
if

uh
i
'm
of
the
age
that
could
have
gone
although
i
did
n't

and
uh
i
guess
uh
looking
back
on
it
i
tend
to
think
it
was
pretty
uh
mostly
a
mistake

on
the
other
hand
uh
the
more
i
learn
about
the
history
the
more
i
see
it
was
incremental
uh
decisions
any
one
of
which
was
sort
of
understandable
at
the
time

and
uh
but
on
the
whole
i
think
it
uh
probably
was
the
wrong
thing
to
do

how
about
you

uh-huh

yeah

right

yeah

yeah

yeah

it
's
funny

tonight
i
was
uh
helping
my
kid
with
an
essay
on
uh
stalin

and
i
was
thinking
in
the
course
of
talking
to
him
about
it
how
uh
in
world
war
two
the
personalties
of
stalin
hitler
and
churchill
more
or
less
defined
the
war

and
actually
when
you
think
back
on
the
big
events
of
the
war
it
was
uh
it
was
almost
a
personal
struggle
among
these
three
uh

i
guess
you
'd
have
to
call
them
great
men
in
some
sense

uh
they
're
certainly
all
leaders

and
uh
and
uh
with
their
nations
pretty
pretty
solidly
behind
each
one
of
them

and
i
got
a
feeling
that
some
of
that
was
involved
in
the
uh
early
decisions
of
the
vietnam
war
that
the
uh
people
saw
the
cold
war
as
uh
you
had
to
draw
a
line
and
and
defend
it

otherwise
there
'd
be
they
'd
get
you
someplace
else

looking
back
it
seems
like
that
was
only
partly
true
that
uh
there
might
have
been
a
better
place
to
draw
the
line

uh
i
guess
you
can
i
guess
you
can
say
that
a
a
certain
amount
of
resolve
and
willingness
to
fight
uh
brought
the
cold
war
to
an
end

but
i
do
n't
think
you
can
just
fight
anywhere
just
just
in
order
to
uh
call
the
bully
out
and
beat
him

and
i
have
a
feeling
that
that
's
part
of
what
was
involved
in
the
vietnamese
war

they
felt
like
this
was
a
place
where
we
could
draw
a
line
beat
them
and
they
would
n't
come
forward

and
uh
we
were
wrong

but
i
uh
you
know

the
like
i
said
the
more
i
hear
about
it
the
more
i
can
see
each
decision
that
was
made
as
being
understandable

but
the
accumulative
effect
was
to
really
get
into
a
a
hopeless
situation
where

and
as
you
say
uh
going
halfway
was
probably
worse
than
uh
committing
uh
committing
to
a
completely
and
uh
winning
it
whatever
that
would
mean

yeah

yeah

yeah

well
you
're
not

it
's
ambivalent

yeah

what
what
about
the
domestic
effects

like
i
was
thinking
that
maybe
the
most
important
effect
it
had
was
to
make
it
uh
possible
and
even
popular
to
uh
criticize
the
government

and
they

that
pendulum
started
to
swing
uh
ma-
maybe
even
too
far
to
the
point
where
uh
uh
supporting
a
government
decision
in
foreign
policy
was
sort
of
optional
from
the
vietnam
war
on

and
that
tradition
is
still

i
mean
it
's
dying
now

but
it
's
still
alive
as
opposed
to

this
desert
storm
stuff
may
have
uh
killed
it

but
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
biggest

that
you
know
the
uh
th-
the
domestic
unrest

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
i
'm
uh
i
i
was
just
uh
in
high
school
i
guess
when
it
when
it
ended

ended
up
being

i
was
in
the
last
last
lottery

and
i
was
glad
it
was
over
by
then

i
've
never
really
totally
understood
what
our
purpose
was
over
there

just
because
you
know
we
did
n't
really
do
anything
when
we
went
over
it
seems
like

you
know
we
uh

those
people
that
i
know

i
work
with
several
that
were
over
there

and
for
some
of
them
it
was
just
kind
of
i
do
n't
know
not
so
much
a
holiday

i
guess
that
's
how
they
tend
to
talk
about
it
but
that
they
just
kind
of
lived
out
in
the
woods

and
ever
now
and
then
they
'd
go
and
shoot
their
rifles

and
then
they
'd
come
back

and
you
know

but
that
they
were
n't
really
allowed
to
do
anything

i
uh

to
me
it
seems
like
we
only
went
halfway
if
even
halfway

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

well
i
i
i
think
we
did
i
think
we
did
learn
some
lessons
that
we
were
n't
uh
we
were
n't
prepared
for

i
guess
the
best
word
would
be
the
atrocities
of
war

uh
i
mean
the
other
wars
seemed
like
a
valiant
war
i
mean
they
seemed
like
a
valiant
thing

you
knew
you
knew
who
was
good

you
knew
who
was
bad

and
it
was
a
it
was
a
traditional
m-
the
traditional
battle
of
kind
of
good
versus
evil
if
you
you
know
whichever
way
it
is

but
in
in
the
vietnam
war
it
seems
like
it
was

a
a
the
sides
and
the
lines
that
were
drawn
are
all
confused
as
to
whose
good
and
whose
bad

and
and
uh
you
know
the

even

it
seems
like
even
the
people
you
know

had
the
south
vietnamese
the
north
vietnamese
and
of
course
the
laotians

and
the
cambodians
were
n't
even
supposed
to
be
involved

but

yeah

yeah

yeah

are
you
in
the
middle
of
anything

the
whole
thing

did
the
framing
and
all

huh

maybe
you
and
i
should
get
together
because
when
i
had
my
last
big
project
i
had
the
contractor
do
the
framing

and
i
did
all
the
sheetrocking
and
the
interior
work

ye-

yeah

my
wife
wishes
i
had
n't
done
that

i
think
it
takes
about
three
or
four
times
before
it
gets
easy

yeah

did
you
you
framed
it
in
f-
uh
on
on
you
framed
in
new
square
footage

or
was
it
stuff
that
was
already
uh
enclosed

brand
new

a-
and
you
knew
how
you
knew
how
to
do
the
framing

uh-huh

do
do
you
build
on
slabs
down
there
or
did
you
build
it
up
off
the
ground

on
the
piers

did

you
had
those
poured

or
you
did
them
yourself

you
just
put
forms
in
the
ground
and
fill
them
with
concrete

huh

well
the
last
thing
i
did
completely
myself
was
an
outside
deck
which
i
was
pretty
proud
of

no

i
designed
it
from
scratch
and
did
it
did
a
pretty
good
job

those
are
nice

they
're
pretty
forgiving
you
know

you
can
always
tear
stuff
out
and
redo
it

it
's
a

right

yeah

i
i
built
it
two
levels
and
with
a
big
toy
box
and
some
benches
and
uh
a
backrest
and
all
that
stuff

i

yeah

i
had
a
friend
with
a
tractor
who
dug
the
pier
holes

so
we
could
pour
concrete
and
support
it
with
a
a
nice
firm
four
by
four
posts

and
uh
and
then
the
rest
of
it
i
just
did

a
a
contractor
friend
helped
me
uh
with
some
of
the
uh
foundation
work

but
uh
it
was
pretty

it
was
about
four
or
five
hundred
square
feet

the
same
size
as
the
addition
that
i
just
put
on

so

yeah

it
's
uh
not
that
expensive

i
think
it
cost
me
three
dollars
a
square
foot
and
uh
you
know
no
less
than
that

co-
cost
me
about
five
hundred
dollars
six
hundred
dollars
all
together

yeah

i
'd
be
surprised
if
it
was
n't
uh
cheaper
where
you
are

well
yeah

it
probably
comes
from
where
you
are

most

when
i
drive
through
that
area
that
's
all
i
see
is
pressure
treated
pressure
treated
lumber
yards

uh-huh

right

east
texas

huh

yeah

my
current
project
is
a
walkway
which
i
'm
building
around
the
house
and
out
to
the
backyard
to
uh
you
know
digging
it
out
and
laying
sand
and
putting
uh
pavers
on
top
of
that

so

that
's
a
lot
easier

no

i
'm
not
in
the
middle
of
anything

i
've
just

about
the
last
thing
i
did

about
maybe
oh
close
to
a
year
ago
now
i
guess
i
i
helped
my
dad
add
on
another
bedroom
on
to
his
house

so
i
guess
that

yeah

that
that
was
fairly
large
undertaking

a
a
it
's
a
bedroom
and
a
walk-in
closet
and
a
bathroom
all
on
one
side
of
the
house

oh
we
did
it
all
except
for
the
sheetrocking

that
was
the
only
thing
we
did
n't
you
know
putting
the
ceiling
up
and
things
like
that

we
do
n't
we
we
were
n't
sure
how
to
do
that

and

yeah

that
's
the
exact
opposite

we
did
all
put
the
roof
up
and
did
all
the
roofing
and
the
put
all
the
interior
walls
up

we
just
did
n't
do
any
of
the
sheetrock
wall
work

and
that
's
it
because
you
have
you
know
get
those
joints
to
go
together

and
whatever
you
have
to
put
in
there
to
get
the
s-
to
take
the
gaps
out
between
the
sheets
and
on
the
ceiling
and
all
that

i
di-
we
did
n't
know
a
thing
about
any
of
that

and
so

it
's
it
looked
very
hard
to
do

so

we
figured
well
just

i
did
n't
think
we
could
do
it
and
make
it
look
professional

so
we
left
it
left
it
to
somebody
who
does
it
for
a
living

but

probably
so

and
i
we
'd
never
done
it

so
we
just
left
it
alone

but
that
's

i
guess
i
'm
only
twenty-one

so
i
my
my
vast
experience
of
home
home
owner
's
knowledge
is
not
very
much

so
it
's
just
what
i
have
to
do
more
or
less
around
the
house
you
know
for
my
parents

so

it
was
brand
new

we
started
with
the
backyard
and
turned
it
into
part
of
the
house

so
it
was

uh
well
my
dad
knew
how
to
do
most
of
it
you
know

he
he
'd
we
'd
gotten
a
couple
of
books

and
then
he
just
started
doing
it

i
do
n't
know

he
well
he
did
all
the
flooring
himself

he
put
the
whole
the
whole
floor
in

and
then
i
just
started
with
the
walls
and
the
roof
and
started
there

and
then
we
were
put
a
like
a
not
not
necessarily
a
garage
but
just
like
a
off
the
side
of
that

after
we
had
the
house
part
made
we
just
decided
we
'd
carry
the
roof
out
a
little
bit
farther
and
put
a
carport
more
or
less

it
's
not
you
know
it
's
not
enclosed

it
's
just
somewhere
to
drive
another
car
to
to
park

and
it
's

uh
it
's
off
the
ground

uh-huh

it
's
on
about
uh
twenty-two
inch
piers
something
like
that

so

uh
no

those
those
are

we
did
those
ourselves

so

yeah

exactly

so
it
's

yeah

those
ar-
those
are

we
'd
i
've
done
one

i
helped
somebody
do
one
of
those
before

those
are
those
are
you
know

you
can
buy
them
in
kits

but
we
did
n't
do
that
way

but
it
's

yeah

yeah

yeah

that
's
not
near
like
building
a
house
or
anything

but

yeah

those
are
nice

especially
when
you
get
done
you
've
got
something
you
know

i
do
n't
know

i
like
them

you
just
sit
down
on
on
the
deck
and
do
whatever
have
a
barbecue

or

yeah

that
sounds
nice

all
done
by
yourself
huh

designed

yeah

yeah

that
's
pretty
that
's
a
good
size
deck

so
yeah

that
's

yeah

that
's
not

yeah

that
's
good

that
's
not
bad
at
all

did
n't
have
to

th-
the
wood
may

it
got
surprising
as
to
the
fact
that
how
much
wood
is
you
know

to
get
to
get
good
lumber
it
costs

i
do
n't
know
about
dallas
but
arou-
even
in
this
little
town
it
's
it
's
not
cheap
at
all

i
was
surprised

it
's
probably
more
there

yeah

yeah

that
it
probably
does

i
i
'm
not
sure

but

yeah

it
's
nothing
but
woods
up
here
down
here

yeah

i
do
n't
i
have
n't
i
mean
i
have
n't

i
used
to
live
in
dallas
in
arlington
actually

and
but
that
was
just
when
i
was
a
kid

so
i
do
n't
really
know
what
the
cost
of
living
is
even
like
in
dallas
anymore

but
it
's
i
do
n't
know
we
're
a
college
town

so
that
does
n't
help
us
out
any

we
have

gas
is
a
dollar
t-
dollar
twelve
a
gallon

so
that
's
probably
about
what
you
're
paying

so

yeah

you
've
got
something
going
all
the
time

go
ahead

uh
no

i
have
n't

but
in
my
job
i
'm
a
nurse
and
we
are
allowed
to
be

i
mean
you
know
this
is
the
rules
that
they
can
do
this
anytime

uh
i
do
n't
know
of
anyone
who
ever
has
been
picked
out
and
been
tested

they
can
if
they
choose
to

right

have
you
well
wai-
have
you
had
any
experience
with
it
at
all

uh-huh

so
what
do
you
think
about
that

right

right

see
i
know
of
that
too

and
i
also
know
that
things
like
antihistamines
sudafeds
things
like
that
can
really
throw
it
off

and
you
cannot
get
a
job
because
of
it

and
they
may
not
tell
you
the
reason
why
uh-huh

see
and
so
it
really
is
a
dangerous
thing
that
way

because
i
know
of
somebody
that
tested
for
an
airline
and
did
n't
get
the
job

and
they
were
n't
told
why

but
a
lot
of
people
say
the
reason
why
after
you
take
a
physical
will
be
because
of
the
drug
testing

or
they
would
tell
you

or
this
person
never
use
any
drugs

uh
you
should

because
you
should
be
given
another
chance
or
at
least
be
able
to
justify
it
or
something

i
have
real
mixed
feelings
about
it

i
do
n't
know

the
accuracy

i
do
n't
know

i
do
n't
know

but
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
can
influence
them

and
i
think
that
a
person
deserves
a
second
chance
with
it
or
something
because
most
things
will
stay
in
your
system
for
a
long
time

and
if
you
could
show
that

i
i
interviewed
for
a
job
recently

and
i
was
taking
entex
and
my
doctor
gave
me
a
prescription
for
it

and
he
said
this
way
if
it
were
to
make
the
drug
test
positive
you
have
proof
that
your
doctor
ordered
this
for
you
you
know

and
it
did
n't
come
up
that
i
needed
to
do
it

but
this
could
happen
to
anybody

and
if
they
would
just
say
oh
this
person
's
drug
test
is
positive
we
wo
n't
hire
them
you
know
then
you
could
lose
out
on
a
job
when
really
you
did
n't
do
anything

so
i
do
n't
know

yeah

i
'm
not
sure
either

the
only
way
i
can
see
it
is
that
if
they
really
suspect
a
person
of
using
it
then
they
have
the
right
to
go
ahead
and
prove
it

because
they
say
they
can
spot
check

yeah

well
it
sort
of
is

and
this
is
it

this

i
'm
not
real
sure
how
i
feel
about
it
because
i
can
see
it
from
two
ways

you
know
as
a
health
professional
i
would
n't
want
somebody
to
take
care
of
me
that
was
using
drugs

you
know
so
as
a
patient
i
feel
well
yeah
we
probably
should
be
protected

but
on
the
other
hand
there
's
a
lot
of
things
i
should
be
protected
from
that
they
do
n't
test
my
patients
for
too

so
you
know
i
guess
you
sort
of
you
have
to
have
trust
some
place
along
the
way

you
ca
n't
go
around
testing
everybody
for
everything

so
i
do
n't
know

and
i
i
think
it
could
be
used
to
hassle
somebody

if
someone
was
out
to
get
you
i
think
that
a
company
or
a
boss
could
use
this

you
know
they
could
keep
on
doing
this
to
you
or
something
i
guess

i
can
see
where
it
could
become
a
problem

really

oh
wow
but
maybe
you
should
n't
be
held
responsible
for
something
you
did
several
years
ago

that
's
the
other
thing

i
mean
a
lot
of
a
lot
of
people
as
kids
or
you
know
young
people
get
into
some
things
that
they
get
out
of
later
on

and
i
do
n't
think
they
should
really
have
to
pay
for
that
forever

yeah

i
think
that
's
true

yeah

yeah

so
that
probably
would
n't
be
too
good
either

uh
have
you
every
been
tested
for
a
new
job
or
anything

so
it
's
just
sort
of
uh

they
can
if
they

oh
okay

uh
not
really

but
i
've
always
worked
on
a
university
level

but
a
lot
of
my
friends
had
to
be
tested
before
they
got
summer
jobs
and
stuff

uh
i
do
n't
i
do
n't
think
they
're
very
accurate

because
i
mean
i
know
their
lifestyles
changed
p-
prior
to
the
drug
test

and
i
know
they
changed
afterwards

yeah

i
i
had
a
friend

it
did
n't
cause
her
any
problems
with
her
job

but
it
came
back
that
she
tested
positive
for
using
a
hallucinogen

but
what
it
was
was
she
had
been
u-
she
had
been
uh
in
the
jungle

and
it
was
some
malaria
medication

and
she
tested
positive
for
that

see
i
always

i
thought
they
got
you
got
called
back
if
you
tested
positive
for
more
tests

how
do
you
know
how
wrong
they
are

are
they
i
mean
is
there
a
margin
of
error

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

and
i
i
'm
not
so
sure
they
are
that
needed

i
mean
ye-

if
you
're
using
it
while
at
a
job
i
can
see
a
problem

but
the
occasional
person
then
it
's
almost
like
it
's
almost
an
infringement
of
your
privacy

yeah

yeah

yeah

and
it
it
's
like
it
seems
like
now
they
have
tests

i
guess
they
can
test
your
hair

and
they
can
find
out
if
you
use
drugs
up
to
several
years
ago

so

i
know

yeah

there
's
a
lot
of
things
you
do
as
a
kid
that
you
would
n't
do
as
an
adult

but
you
ca
n't
say
it
was
wrong
at
the
time

well
i
have
five

right

well
five
are
i
mean
four
of
them
are
grown

they
're
in
college
or
just
out
of
college

so
i
really
have
just
a
thirteen
year
old
at
home

well
i
work
at
it

i
try
to
fool
everybody

uh-huh

uh-huh

i
think
you
are
right

because
i
was
an
only
child
too

and
that
's
one
reason
i
have
so
many
because
i
really
i
enjoy
the
big
family

and
my
thirteen
year
old
is
pretty
separate
from
her
brother
and
sisters

and
so
she
is
sort
of
like
an
only
child

and
it
's
the
same
type
of
thing
uh

uh-huh

yeah

right

that
's
exactly
how
it
is
you
know

she
's
got
all
these
sisters
and
her
brother
to
take
care
of
her

when
things
do
n't
go
right
she
just
calls
one
of
them
you
know

but
uh
yeah

it
it
's
a
little
bit
difficult
though

i
think
it
was
easier
when
they
all
had
each
other
and
could
entertain
each
other
and
i
was
home
more

and

we
we
really
did
not

my
next
oldest
daughter
that
's
in
college
in
california
is
a
world
twirling
champion

she
twirls
a
baton

and
we
did
a
lot
of
things
together

she
and
i
did
a
lot
of
things
together
and
flew

we
have
flown
all
over
the
world
for
her
to
compete
and
to
perform

and
that
was
a
lot
of
fun

but
that
that
i
guess
you
could
consider
that
organized

i
mean
there
is
a
competition
all
the
time

we
were
very
heavy
into
that

other
than
that
they
were
pretty
much

and
maybe
dancing
school
for
a
while
or
mainly
school
sports
and
things
like
that

uh-huh

well
you
ca
n't
afford
to

right

right

that
's
right

uh-huh

yeah

well
i
know
i
spent
hours
in
the
gym
every
day
with
my
daughter

and
my
little
one
also
competed
because
really
she
had
no
choice

she
had
to
go
with
me

so
the
three
of
us
just
spent
a
lot
of
time
traveling
and
and
competing

and
of
course
the
competing
itself
really
did
n't
matter
what
it
was

it
was
making
the
friends
and
going
all
the
places

and
it
was
a
really
neat
experience

but
it
took
our
total
time

i
did
not
work
uh
when
i
did
this

now
i
do
work
full-time

and
it
's
just
my
thirteen
year
old
and
myself

and
so
we
really
have
to
keep
it
together
to
get
just
her
activities
in
and
still
have
time
to
spend
with
each
other

so

yeah

really

well
things
cost
a
lot
more

i
do
n't
know
how
it
is
in
georgia

and
i
do
n't
think
our
part
of
the
country
is
particularly
bad
compared
to
some

is
it

really

right

that
's
what
i
've
heard

huh

yeah

i
'm
surprised
to
hear
that

i
've
heard
very
positive
things
about
atlanta

how
many
children
do
you
have
now

you
have
five

well
you
do
have
a
hard
time
finding
time
then
do
n't
you

uh-huh

you
sound
so
young

all
right

to
have
them
uh

i
think
you
're
doing
a
good
job

i
just
have
one
child

and
uh
i
do
n't
think
uh

well
there
's
not
much
i
can
do
about
it

my
my
wife
and
i
are
u-
in
our
forties
you
know

so
uh

but
it
's
hard
to
raise
one
child
without
them
thinking
they
're
the
they
're
the
pivot
point
of
the
universe

yeah

uh-huh

i
have
a
younger
brother
like
that

i
'm
in
my
forties
like
i
say

and
i
have
a
brother
in
his
twenties

and
i
was
i
was
the
youngest

so
i
understand
how
that
worked

and
he
was
treated
like
he
had
five
fathers
or
something

yeah

did
you
all
do
a
lot
of
organized
things
like
uh
little
league
uh
soccer

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

you
know
i
think
that
's
probably
true
the

if
you
have
one
child
or
fewer
you
get
involved
in
organized
events
or
activities

and
if
you
have
a
large
number
of
children
or
then
you
do
n't

no

you
ca-

and
there
's
not
enough
time
uh

like
my
son
is
in
uh
little
league
this
year

he
's
ten

and
they
practice
three
times
a
week

and
they
have
a
game

and
it
's
just
uh
if
there
were
more
than
one
child
i
do
n't
know
the-
there
would
be
no
way
to
do
it

you
know
one
parent
go
one
direction

and
i
'd
have
to
go
in
the
other

and
we
could
only
cover
two
at
that

uh-huh

uh-huh

i
do
n't
think
although
i-
i-

i
think
a
a
more
than
one
child
probably
three
children
is
probably
the
ideal
to
me

but
i
'm
not
sure
i
could
afford
three

i
most
certainly
could
n't
educate
three

i
do
n't
know
how
my
my
parents
did
it

i
mean
there
were
five
of
us

and
i
do
n't
recall
you
know
wanting
anything
in
particular

uh
but
i
do
n't
know
how
my
father
did
it

he
worked
at
a
truck
line

and
he
just
did
n't
make
that
kind
of
money
with
five
children

but
we
did
okay

we
had
a
house
and
a
home
and

but
now
my
wife
and
i
both
work

and
we
do
n't
i
do
n't
believe
we
have
as
much
as
my
parents
did

and
we
only
have
one
child

uh-huh

huh

atlanta
is
horrible

yes

ha-
we
have
a
lot
of
people
moving
here
from
boston
and
and
different
areas

and
from
talking
to
them
they
're
shocked

wha-

and
they
you
know

the
housing
is
so
cheap
in
comparison
to
boston
that
they
jump
on
it

they
sell
their
house

they
stash
away
a
good
bit
of
money
and
come
down
here

and
i
work
with
a
lot
of
them

they
they
think
they
they
have
really
done
something

then
when
they
get
down
here
they
realize
the
cost
of
living
is
outrageous
compared
to
to
where
they
came
from

the
housing
is
cheaper

but
that
's
about
it

okay

i
'm
not
as
ashamed
to
claim
them
this
year
as
i
have
been
so

oh
yeah

right
well

really

why

uh-huh

yeah

well
it
will
be
fun
for
you
to
watch
up
there
anyway
to
see
what
happens
now
you

uh-huh

right

well
it
depends
on
where
you
're
from
in
texas

i
live
right
by
dallas
so
we
have
one
football
team
as
far
as
we
're
concerned

that
's
how
it
is

it
's
divided

yeah

it
really
is

so
we
've
got
our
cowboys
here

and
and
uh
i
do
n't
think
anybody
roots
differently

but
i
have
a
boyfriend
that
lives
in
fresno

and
he
is
for
the
l
the
uh
raiders
l
a
raiders

so

well
i
just
started
to
this
year
because
of
these
silly
raiders
that
did
n't
do
very
well

but
i
've
been
trying
more
this
year

i
think
i
know
a
little
more
than
i
use
to

i
never
knew
very
much
at
all

so
i
'm
trying

yeah

so
i
should
n't
even
try
to
do
it
huh

yes

right

yeah

really

i
do
n't
even
think
we
have
that
in
texas

we
might

do
we

i
mean
no

you
probably
know

i
do
n't
know

nobody
talks
about
it

so
i
do
n't
think
we
do

no

uh-huh

and
we
have
a
soccer
team
that
comes
and
goes

we
do
n't
even
have
that
very
much

so

uh-huh

yeah

oh

oh
yeah

yeah

well
i
like
to
do

i
do
n't
like
to
watch

i
do
n't
like
to
watch
anything

so
it
kind
of
annoys
me
when
people
just
lay
in
front
of
a
t
v
and
watch
all
this
stuff

i
think
it
's
an
excuse
to
do
nothing

and
i
i
can
see
what
you
're
saying
about
the
male
bonding

and
the
guys
get
together

and
that
's
kind
of
cool

that
's
fun
you
know

but
it
can
get
really
overdone

yeah

i
have

yeah

yeah

i
have

uh
no

actually
no

i
've
done
that
for
college
football

yeah

yeah

right

and
that
's
the
thing
you
know

yeah

yeah

that
's
right

yeah

that
's
right

uh-huh

yeah

well
in
high
school
i
went
to
every
football
game

and
well
i
twirled
you
know

and
i
you
know
i
did
n't

i
still
do
n't
know
that
much
about
football
obviously

but
i
still
had
a
good
time
you
know

oh
so

well
it

let
's
put
it
this
way

we
've
got
the
new
england
patriots
up
here

so

they
've
had
some
serious
problems
in
the
past
couple
of
years

yeah

um
well
uh
partly
due
to
ownership

you
know
uh
victor
kiam
owned
the
uh
the
patriots
uh
for
a
period
of
a
number
of
years

and
he
always
had
this
uh
this
wonderful
quality
of
c-
being
able
to
put
his
foot
in
his
mouth
every
time
he
went
to
say
something

and
uh
they
've
had
some
financial
problems
with
the
team
and
so
forth

and
it
recently
was
sold
to
uh
some
other
people

so
hopefully
this
ownership
can
set
up
new
direction
and
uh
keep
uh
the
patriots
in
the
new
england
area
anyways

oh
yeah

i
've
been
to
a
couple
i
've
been
to
a
few
games
before

now
you
you
're
you
're
from
texas

so
you
've
got
two
football
teams
down
there

uh-huh

oh
i
see

there
's
that
type
of
segregation
huh

wow

uh-huh

do
you

uh-huh

do
you
follow
professional
sports
at
all

yeah

well
it
's
a
good
past
time
you
know

particularly
football

they
say
uh
i-
football
attracts
more
men
because
of
the
you
know
y-
the
you
see
the
the
physical
aggression
on
the
field

and
supposedly
psychologists
say
that
uh
that
uh
men
take
out
their
frustrations
by
watching
football

and
you
know
they
get
together
with
a
bunch
of
guys

and
they
uh
uh
and
they
have
a
good
time
and
everything

and
that
's
suppose
to
be
some
of
the
uh
the
male
bonding
and
the
and
the
uh
the
male
instincts
i
guess
or
something
about
the
uh

well
no

it
it
's
good
as
in
terms
of
in
terms
of
uh
of
a
contest

i
think
that
uh

i
personally
like
hockey
better
because
it
has
contact
it
's
a
contact
sport

it
has
the
speed

and
the
hand
eye
coordination

and
it
takes
a
certain
skill
to
play
hockey

not
everybody
can
play
hockey

so
we

and

that
's

we
're
a
big
hockey
area
up
here

i
bet
up
here
in
new
england
as
well
as
you
know
in
in
the
minnesota
area

but

what
hockey

no

there
's
no
hockey

there
's
no

there
's
no
professional
hockey
teams
in
in
texas

yeah

i
think
though
that
professional
football
in
particular
is
becoming
so
diluted
now

like
they
have
this
world
football
league

you
see
we
have
the
n
f
l
that
that
dallas
and
houston
are
in
and
new
england
patriots
and
l
a
raiders
and
those
teams

there
are
those
teams
that
play
in
professional
national
football
league

but
uh
now
they
have
what
's
called
the
world
football
league

and
they
have
all
these
teams
from

there
's
a
team
in
london

and
there
's
a
team
there
there
's
uh
teams
other
european
teams

and
there
's
teams
in
the
united
states

an-
and
they
're
playing
now
during
the
summer
months

and
it
's
really
you
know
overkill

and
there
's
only
so
much
football
you
can
watch

yeah

that
's
good

yeah

uh-huh

now
have
you
ever
been
to
a
professional
football
game

have
you

did
you
do
the
whole
big
th-
the
whole
thing
the
tailgate
party
and
the
whole

well
see
now
see
that
's
what
you
got
to
do
see

now
we
talked
our

yeah

yeah

you
the

well
the
same
thing

we
we
talked
our
wives

there
's
about
six
or
eight
guys
that
we
use
to
go
out
for
these
games

and
uh
we
talked
our
wives
into
going
with
us
one
time

and
they
had
a
real
good
time

and
it
was
basically
for
the
social
atmosphere

you
go
you
know
three
or
four
hours
before
the
game

you
go
set
up

we
set
a
table
up

we
do
some
cooking
some
barbecueing
have
a
few
drinks
and
then
go
in
and
see
the
game
and
see
the
patriots
lose
and
then
go
home
and
eat
drink
some
more

but
but
that
whole

it
it
's
not
so
much
sure
the
contest
itself
and
the
game
itself

but
it
's
the
whole
atmosphere
of
playing
uh
of
going
to
a
game
i-

that
you
miss
sitting
home
in
your
parlor
you
know
uh
with
with
a
six
pack
of
beer
and
some
uh
potato
chips
you
know

you
you
miss
that

and
and
any
professional
sport
i
think
you
miss
that

the
atmosphere
of
being
there
you
know

yep

well
foot-

think
about
this

i
do

uh

so
you
see
a
big
difference
then
in
before
and
now
do
you

or

a
lot
of
testing

uh-huh

uh-huh

i
do
too

i
oh
i
think
that
's
awful

i
know

what
's
the
new
criteria
huh

we
have
all
kinds
of
testing

and
it
's
over
and
over

it
's
i
t
b
s
or
and
uh
just
everything
everything

and
they
test
test
test

i
live
in
plano
actually

and
i
do
n't
know
if
you
've
heard
of
plano

but
it
's
a
very
transient
community

a
lot
of
people
from
everywhere

it
's
just
north
of
dallas

and
it
's
grown
in
leaps
and
bounds

i
we
must
have
maybe
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
now

and
most
of
them
from
other
places

uh
j
c
penney
's
come
down
from
new
york
and
of
course
t
i
and
xerox
from
rochester

and
we
just
have
lots
of
people
from
everywhere
lots
of
industry
coming
in

and
it
's
a
very
wealthy
community

uh
not
that
i
am

but
other
people
seem
to
be

and
i
would
love
to
know
why

but
i
mean
they
do

they
have

i
i
would

i
really
would

i
mean
they
just
have
beautiful
beautiful
homes

and
they
have
everything

the
kids
only
wear
name
brand
things
to
school

and
it
's
one
of
these
things

well
it
does
you
know

it
really
does
because
i
'm
a
single
mom
and
i
have
a
thirteen
year
old
now

and
uh
you
know
it
does

i
mean
we
do
it
to
a
point

but
uh
not
to
where
she
feels
different

but
some
of
them
are
very
rich

and
so
uh
we
just
kind
of
have
everything
here

and
we
have
a
very
goal
oriented
population
because
their
parents
are

and
so
i
do
n't
know
how
much
of
it
is
us
and
how
much
of
it
is
texas

but
the
kids
are
expected
to
excel
in
everything

and
it
's
almost
impossible
because
you
have
so
many
children
and
just
so
many
activities
that
everybody
ca
n't
be
first

and
they
're
expected
to
be

you
know
their
parents
expect
it

the
teachers
expect
it

texas
wants
very
badly
to
be
considered
tops
in
the
school
system

and
if
you
read
national
surveys
they
're
far
from
it

and
so
there
's
just
a
whole
lot
of
testing
and
a
whole
lot
of
pushing
to
do
well
on
these
tests

well
not
very
well

they
bring
home
notes
that
say
they
have
to
get
a
good
night
's
sleep
and
eat
right
in
the
morning
before
tests

i
mean
they
make
a
big
deal

to
me
the
paper
should
just
be
put
on
the
desk
that
day

and
say
just
do
this

you
know
i
just
feel
they
do
better
that
way

and

yeah

and
and
i
have
older
children
too
that
now
are
out
of
high
school

and
they
've
always
done
this
here

i
mean
it
's
always
been
the
same

but
it
is
it
's
getting
worse
and
worse

is
more
pressure
for
everything

and
i
just
think
it
's
really
awful

and
i
i
'm
with
you
on
that

you
do
n't
hear
too
many
people
say
this

but
i
think
it
's
a
very
long
day

and
my
feeling
is
that
you
know
you
're
only
a
kid
once
and
you
do
n't
want
to
spend
your
whole
life
in
school

uh-huh

uh-huh

and
i
do
n't
think
that
's
right

i
think
we
should
do
what
europe
does
and
include
cultural
activities
in
our
school
system

i
do
n't
think
i
should
have
to
pay
for
dancing
lessons
gymnastics
piano

i
would
like
to
see
those
things
included
in
our
school
system
because
i
think
we
should
have
well-rounded
kids
not
just
book
smart
kids

and
so
i
just
find
this
a
real
problem

i
think
if
they
're
going
to
be
there
all
day
they
should
find
time

one
of
my
daughters
once
was
out
of
school
with
mono
in
her
junior
year
i
think
it
was

and
she
had
a
home
teacher
for
like
four
hours
a
week

and
when
she
went
back
in
six
weeks
she
was
ahead

so
what
does
that
tell
you

it
tells
you
there
's
a
whole
lot
of
wasted
time

and
they
could
be
using
this
time
better

uh-huh

that
's
a
very
long
day
for
kindergartners

but
i
think
that
working
parents
have
kind
of
demanded
this

you
know
because
they
do
n't
they
do
n't
want
to
send
them
to
daycare

that
's
why
they
want
them
there
because
them
somebody
takes
care
of
them
all
day

we
have
them
at
one
school
like

uh
do
you
have
children
in
school

uh
i
have
two
that
are
uh
now
just
about
ready
to
graduate
from
college

but
i
also
have
two
that
are
just
entering
school

uh
uh
well
i
think
they
're
just
pushing
them
mu-
entirely
to
fast

uh
well
it
seems
to
me
that
kindergarten
is
now
the
equivalent
of
first
grade

my
son
leaves
the
house
at
seven
thirty
and
does
n't
get
home
until
three
o'clock

and
i
think
that
's
such
a
long
day
for
a
kindergartner

and
uh
i
have
a
preschooler

uh
i
was
told
by
her
preschool
teacher
that
she
thought
maybe
she
was
to
immature
for
kindergarten

and
i
thought
well
how
mature
do
you
have
to
be

and
uh
there
is
a

do
you
have
the
standardized
testing
now

yeah

no

uh-huh

oh

yeah

yeah

you
would
like
to
know
what
they
're
doing
right

oh
me

well
that
makes
it
hard
for
you
does
n't
it

oh
me

yeah

it
's
hard
to
explain
to
them
why
you
ca
n't

right

oh
dear

right

right

how
about
the
kids

how
are
they
coping
with
it

huh
right

yeah

rather
than
anticipating

oh
it
is

that
's
right

my
son
said
that
came
home

and
he
said
he
said
mom
all
we
do
is
work

we
hardly
ever
play

and

oh
likewise

right

would
n't
that
be
great

uh-huh

right

is
that
right

oh
my
gosh

oh
my
gosh

well
for
example
in
my
son
's
kindergarten
they
're
really
finished
at
lunch
time

after
lunch
they
have
some
uh

i
'm
trying
to
think
if
they
have
recess
after
lunch

and
then
they
have
naps
or
rest
period

and
uh
i
think
either
send
them
home
or
do
something
a
little
more
interesting

i
agree

i
would
n't
be
surprised

i
doubt
if
they
would
say
it
was
too
long

uh
do
you
have
the
before
school
care
at
your
school
and
the
after
school
care

what
do
you
think

uh-huh

i
can
be

but
go
ahead

right

right

we
fax
everything

we
do
n't
even
wait
for
the
mail
anymore

right

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

right

you
're
expected
to

exactly

and
i
recently
read
an
article
on
just
this
that
said
stress
today
is
so
much
worse

it
should
be
less
because
we
have
a
microwave

and
our
grandmothers
had
to
bake
brownies

and
we
can
throw
them
in
a
microwave
for
two
minutes

but
the
more
conveniences
we
have
the
more
that
's
expected
of
us

and
we
have
no
down
time

like
we
do
n't
stop
and
wait
for
things
to
happen
because
we
do
n't
have
to

so
we
keep
moving

we
do
n't
stop
and
wait
for
the
things
to
bake
and
this
to
happen
and
that
to
happen

we
just
hit
buttons
and
keep
going
to
the
next
thing

so
we
have
no
relaxation
time
in
between

so
they
say
that
's
really
a
bad
thing
that
you
need
to
learn
a
lot
of
ways
to
to
deal
with
that
and
get
your
your
time
in
between
things

so
that
's
good

that
's
an
interesting
point

but
i
just
think
our
our
family
lives
have
changed
drastically

and
i
think
that
's
ju-

of
course
a
part
of
it
is
technology

i
mean
our
kids
where
would
they
be
without
nintendo
and
you
know
their
t
v
shows

and
no-

some
of
that
is
really
bad
i
think

but
we
have
all
single
families

so
many
single
families
now

uh
a
lot
of
working

both
parents
are
working

so
there
's
a
whole
big
effect
on
our
kids

and
not
very
many
of
my
daughter
's
friends
really
are
on
their
original
mother
and
father

you
know
i
'm
wondering
what
this
is
going
to
do
in
ten
and
twenty
years

you
're
probably
right

and
i
'm
an
o
b
nurse

and
that
's
never
really
occurred
to
me
but
that
's
that
's
interesting

i
never
really
thought
about
it
that
way

yeah

yeah

that
's
true

when
is
this
good
or
not
good

we
do
n't
know
that
yet

yeah

i
do
n't
know
either

that
's
true

right

right

yeah

yeah

that
's
kind
of
scary

huh
well
that
's
true

but
i

it
's
just
very
very
different

and
i
guess
every
ten
years
it
's
just
been
very
different

so
and
i
do
n't
know
what
's
going
to
happen

uh
i
know
what
i
'm
seeing
here
at
m-
my
job
is
that
people
are
having
their
children
much
later
in
life
so
that
they
're
establishing
careers

and
they
've
got
their
homes

and
they
've
got

well
uh
i
ca
n't
be
terribly
authoritative
on
what
life
was
like
thirty
years
ago
uh
because
i
'm
not
that
old
yet

um

uh
i
know
that
uh

i
mean
obviously
you
look
at
at
technologic-
the
technological
aspect
of
of
social
change

i
mean
you
did
n't
have
uh
you
did
n't
have
video
games

you
did
n't
have
home
computers

you
did
n't
have
xerox
machines

i
mean
uh
you
you
try
to

you
go
into
a
a
business
today

and
you
you
try
to
imagine
the
whole
thing
except
running
off
of
carbon
paper

and
it
's
almost
inconceivable
now
because
the
xerox
machines
and
and
everything
have
become
such
you
know
su-
such
a
a
par-
a
part
of
the
way
we
live

and

yeah

uh-huh

yeah
uh

a
business
associate
of
mine
was
was
talking
about
how
it
used
to
be
where
you
would
send
things
through
the
mail

and
you
had
to
do
something

this
was
concerning
the
s
e
c

and
so
if
they
had
business
to
do
they
had
to
finish
it
you
know
three
days
in
advance
so
they
could
get
it
through
the
mail

and
now
it
's
the
kind
of
thing
where
you
can
work
up
until
the
last
minute
because
you
can
get
it
there
you
know
in
in
a
matter
of
minutes
you
know
through
a
fax
machine

and
because
of
that
these
quote
unquote
convenience
type
items
have
made
work
that
much
more
intense
and
that
much
harder

because
you
're
expected
to
work
on
stuff
up
until
the
last
minute

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
there
's
that

and
there
's
the
fact
that
you
know
nowadays
fewer
and
fewer
couples
are
deciding
to
have
kids
which
generally
tends
to
happen

i
mean
the
u
s
would
be
actually
declining
in
population
slightly
if
it
were
n't
for
the
fact
that
we
have
continuation
large
scale
immigration
into
the
country

yeah

yeah

i
saw
that
the
numbers
on
that
awhile
back

and
i
was
like
uh-huh

so

well
uh
in
terms
of
the
long
term
effect
effect
on
on
america
in
terms
of
the
culture
and
everything
i
do
n't
know

uh
most
of
the
of
the
next
generation
is
going
to
be
in
or
or
an
ex-
ex-
extremely
large
par-
part
of
the
next
generation
is
going
to
be
you
know
second
generation
f-
uh
from
immigrant
parents

and
they
're
going
to
be
really
struggling

and
i
do
n't
think
that
america
is
currently
the
type
of
environment
where
struggling
up
from
the
bottom
is
necessarily
considered
to
be
good

i
mean
it
's
no
longer
the
the
uh
the
accomplishment
that
it
that
it
once
was

and
not
that
many
people
are
really
trying
i
do
n't
think

yeah

yeah

tha-

okay
randall
uh
uh

do
you
have
any
special
interest
in
uh
space
flight

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

what
do
you
do
now

oh

yeah

to
bad
huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
uh
yo-
i
uh
i
'm
kind
of
young

i
'm
only
twenty-two

and
so
uh
uh
i
'm
not
you
know

there
's
a
lot
that
's
happened
in
my
lifetime
as
far
as
uh
you
know
with
the
space
shuttle
and
all
although
plans
to
uh
go
to
other
planets
have
somewhat
been
thwarted
in
comparison
to
uh
the
sixties

uh
although
i
have
a

i
i
kind
of
wonder
uh
if
some
if
it
were
possible
to
market
some
uh
form
of
uh
space
technology
you
know
to
uh
uh
to
make
it
equitable
it
might
severely
help
the
economy
you
know
in
the
in
the
uh
respect
that
you
know
there
's
endless
amounts
of
research
to
be
done
endless
amounts
of
resources
and
and
whatnot

it
would
be
great
if
we
could
find
some
way
to
to
uh
use
that
to
boost
the
economy

uh-huh

exactly

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

yeah

it
seems
like
uh
there
's

so
you
're
talking
about
positive
side
effects
then

okay

i
understand

sure

that
makes
a
lot
of
sense

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

right

exactly

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

uh-huh

exactly

least
not

yeah

right

now
we
're
done

yeah

i
think
you
're
right

i
would
too

i
'd
i
'd
uh

was
it
john
denver
that
that
tried
to
buy
his
way
on
to
the
space
shuttle

oh
yeah

ever
since
i
was
a
young
and
uh
used
to
watch
the
old
uh
apollo
missions
going
off
in
uh
classroom
t
v
-s

uh
i
suspect
a
lot
of
people
uh
uh
got
uh
turned
on
by
watching
watching
those
go
off

uh
very
exciting

the
uh
uh

i
've
al-
i
've
always
uh
w-
wanted
very
much
uh
to
uh
be
somehow
involved
in
all
that
and
uh
to
uh
meet
and
and
to
see
see
it
actually
happen

of
course
i
've
really
wanted
to
actually
manage
to
get
into
space
someday

but
uh
that
seems
rather
unlikely
at
this
point
unfortunately

uh
computer
programmer

unfortunately
that
can
be
done
from
the
ground

yeah

made
the
wrong
wrong
career
choice
to
get
up
into
space

the
uh
uh

i
used
to
think
when
i
was
when
i
was
younger
that
uh
by
this
time
we
'd
have
lots
more
in
stuff
in
space
than
we
do
now

uh
frustrating
at
times

i
do
n't
know
what
you
think
about
all
that

uh-huh

yeah

well
yeah

well
the
uh
uh

i
've
always
uh
felt
that
uh
uh
one
of
the
long-term
solutions
that
at
least
a
few
of
our
problems
would
be
to
have
uh
some
sort
of
uh
solar
power
satellites
up

uh
because
that
's
a
uh
you
know
in
singularly
renewable
resource
that
does
n't
do
it
that
does
n't
require
uh
uh
any
particularly
nasty
environment
impact

and
you
can
just
get
as
much
power
as
you
need
up
there

it
's
just
a
matter
of
how
big
you
build
it

uh
and
of
course
the
side
effects
of
this
is
that
you
have
to
have
uh
lunar
mining
bases
and
space
stations
and
easy
transport
into
space
and
no
things
that
i
think
we
should
be
doing

so
the
side
effects
of
doing
that
which
i
think
would
be
good
you
know
very
very
good
for
al-
for
everyone
in
the
long
run
is
uh
is
it
some
of
the
other
things
i
'd
like
to
see
happen
would
happen
also

so
i
'm

yeah

right

right

uh
right

the
only
problem
is
of
course
that
uh
that
requires
significant
commitment
from
people
to
actually
decide
they
want
to
put
things
like
that
up
there

and
they
want
to
do
the
research

and
uh
they
're
all
you
know
nor-

the
only
commitments
that
they
're
interested
in
making
or
even
talking
about
are
ones
for
flash
value
like
uh
the
trip
to
mars
which
is
would
would
produce
some
useful
scientific
research
and
so
forth

but
the
same
money
could
probably
be
far
better
spent
on
uh
uh
lunar
bases
and
solar
power
satellite
research
and
you
know
so
forth

it
it
would
de-
it
would
be
being
done
for
the
uh
glitz
and
show
factor
to
get
politician
votes
instead
of
instead
of
for
you
know

we
should
eventually
send
someone
people
to
mars
but
not
just
because
it
's
glitzy
to
do
so

we
should
do
it
because
for
for
the
return
we
get
for
it

and
uh
unfortunately
that
's
not
what
i
thinks
happened

i
i
would
settle
for
the
gli-
for
the
glitz
if
the
side
effects
were
useful
like
the
uh

but
uh

the
downside
of
that
is
you
after
you
do
one
of
those
people
say
well
we
did
it

now
let
's
now
we
're
done

no
need
to
use
this
anymo-
to
play
around
with
this
space
stuff
anymore

that
's
what
happened
with
apollo

uh
but
uh
i
'd
give
almost
anything
to
get
into
space

i
guess
i
guess
by
what
you
said
you
're
you
do
n't
feel
you
're
uh
privacy
has
been
inva-
invaded
anytime
recently

uh-huh

right

uh
no

i
would
n't
call
it
invading
my
privacy
by
any
means

uh
you
know
i
would

there
there
's
a
lot
of
times
though
uh
you
get
those
calls
and
you
know
when
you
're
sitting
at
home
wanting
to
relax
or
or
whatnot

and
you
know
next
thing
you
know
uh
someone
calls
and
wants
to
sell
you
this
or
that

and
it
's
real
hard
to
to
tell
them
you
know
that
you
're
not
interested

or
you
do
tell
them
you
're
not
interested

and
they
still
keep
asking
you
you
know
and
keep
badgering
you
about
it

and
that
aggravates
me

but
i
do
n't
know
that
you
could
call
that
invading
of
invading
my
privacy

because
you
know
if
we
do
n't
want
that
to
happen
all
we
have
to
do
is
just
call
the
phone
company
and
say
look
you
know
i
want
my
name
unlisted
or
want
my
you
know

it
does
n't

uh-huh

oh

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

good
grief

well
let
me
ask
you
about
this

here
's
something
that
uh
has
been
kind
of
concerning
me
lately

my
fiance
received
a
bill
from
a
a
lord
and
taylor
company

uh
you
know
they
're
a
they
're
a
department
store

she
received
a
bill
from
them
uh
that
she
had
visited
some
sto-

and
and
i
think
it
was
there
in
florida

maybe
it
was
in
miami

that
uh
she
had
visited
a
store
there

and
uh
they
had
this
bill
uh
that
she
had
bought
such
and
such
amount
of
merchandise
uh
over
two
hundred
dollars
worth
of
merchandise

uh
and
the
date
that
that
she
supposedly
made
this
purchase
she
was
in
denver
with
me
for
thanksgiving

uh
and
apparently
what
had
happened
is
someone
used
her
social
security
number

uh
and
and
i
've
i
've
heard
recently
that
uh
uh
that
this
is
a
common
occurrence
where
people
are
using
s-
you
know

they
use
joe
blow
's
so-
uh
social
security
number
uh
and
can
uh
potentially
ruin
someone
's
credit

huh

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

well
y-

yeah

yeah

well
we
got
it
cleared
up
eventually

what
happened
uh

no

not
really

uh
u-
th-
uh
th-
the
only
thing
that
annoys
me
is
when
uh
people
call
and
they
uh
you
have
solicitation
calls

that
's
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me

that
's
not
really
invading
my
privacy

uh
do
you
feel
that
yours
is
invaded

but
but
that
does
n't
work

uh
no

because
they
a
lot
of
times
they
dial
sequentially

they
get
your
name
from
uh
if
you
enter
any
type
of
contest
or
anything

uh
you
know
you
enter
a
sweepstake
in
the
local
department
store
for
a
shopping
spree
or
something

you
put
your
phone
number
on
there

they
pass
your
phone
number
on
to
another
company

uh
or
you
uh

or
or
like
the
newspapers
they
just
dial
randomly
or
s-
and
stuff

they
even
call
the
newspapers
here
even
call
people
who
already
subscribe

and
uh
while
i
was
subscribing
to
the
paper
i
got
so
upset
at
them
that
they

you
call
me
one
more
time
i
'm
going
to
stop
subscribing

and
the
lo-
local
local
papers
ask
them
to
remove
your
na-
number
from
their
list

and
uh
yeah

you
call
up
their
regular
during
regular
hours

their
uh
they
have
a
special
department

they
'll
take
your
numbers
out
of
their
lists

uh
but
the
uh
orlando
paper
uh
yeah
they
they
refused
to
take
it
off
of
the
lists

and
they
call
every
month

and
when
you
have
more
than
one
phone
number
you
get
a
call
on
each
number
you
have

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

if
you
know
a
person
's
social
security
number
and
their
mailing
address
i-
and
their
mother
's
maiden
name
uh
you
can
basically
become
that
uh
person

uh
if
the
purchase
was
made
mail
order
they
should
have
a
record
of
where
it
was
shipped
to

and
since
it
was
n't
shipped
to
her
address
she
could
prove
you
know
that
it
was
n't
her

uh
if
it
was
some
you
know
coming
into
the
store
and
stuff
then
she
would
ha-
whoever
made
the
purchase
would
have
had
find
some
kind
of
uh
you
know
document

and
uh
wh-

the
signature
uh

they
should
be
able
to
provide
you
a
copy
with
that
signature

and
if
they
ca
n't
provide
a
signature
you
know
they
'll
have
to
eat
the
charge

but
if
the
pers-
has
you
know
their
social
s-
her
social
security
number
i
'd
be
real
concerned
that
they
uh
that
she
's
not
uh
blacklist
on
uh
tel-
what
is
it
it
's
telecredit
or
something

uh
because
she
wo
n't
be
able
to
cash
checks
because
most
places
verify
through
there

she
probably
wo
n't
be
ab-
able
to
open
a
checking
account
or
anything
without
a
lot
of
hassle

i
went
i
turned
mine
in
about
twelve
hours
early
at
noon

are
you
eating

no
it
's

say
what

tell
you
what
we
can
do
is
uh
i
can
punch
the
uh
one

and
then
w-
after
five
minutes
when
the
uh
uh
voice
comes
on
we
can
talk
all
night
if
we
want

uh
i
love
the
irony
of
uh
talking
about
this
subject
on
april
the
fifteenth

but
uh
i
'm
afraid
i
'm
i
'm
probably
in
the
minority

i
i
actually
do
n't
think
that
we
uh
pay
too
much
in
this
country
uh
uh
particularly
uh
in
this
part
of
the
country
w-

uh
i
guess
i
do
have
a
a
bone
to
pick
with
uh
uh
the
way
taxes
are
distributed

uh
i
just
finished
fuming
at
the
fact
that
we
pay
an
eight
and
a
half
percent
sales
tax
and
no
income
tax
when
the
income
tax
could
have
been
deducted
from
the
federal
form

and
the
sales
tax
ca
n't

i
think
that
's
regressive

and
uh
uh
it
's
kind
of
dumb

well
i
mean
nobody
taxes
groceries

where

is
that
right

right

right

but
i
guess
when
i
hear
when
i
see
the
comparison
between
the
united
states
and
uh
any
other
western
country
uh
their
their
rates
are
like
uh
forty-one
forty-two
and
ours
are
like
thirty-six
thirty-seven
you
know

if
you
compute
as
a
percentage
of
total
income
all
taxes
lumped
together
we
actually
do
pretty
well

t-
th-
there
's
no
other
country
that
's
that
is
taxed
as
low
as
we
are

yeah

uh-huh

i
'm
i
'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
mean

right

oh
you
mean
lowest
end
of
living
in
spite
of
lower
higher
taxes

yeah

i
suppose
that
's
true

yeah

uh
probably
m-
less
so
now
than
it
was
ten
years
ago
or
whatever

but

yeah

right

right

right

yeah

yeah

since
uh
i
send
my
kids
to
parochial
school
that

it
's
not
it
's
not
quite
the
bargain
that

but
i
mean
i
pay
them
gladly

that
's
a
decision

i
think
it
's
a
dumb
decision
on
our
part
because
countries
like
canada
and
england
and
germany
do
perfectly
well
with
a
uh
two
tract
system
in
which
religious
schools
coexist
with
secular
schools
f-
with
the
same
tax
money

but
uh
i
mean
that
's
that
's
the
way
americans
want
to
interpret
it

i
guess
that
's
all
right

but

yeah

i

and
if
i
were
uh

when
i
was
single
and
again
when
i
'm
retired
i
will
not
mind
paying
uh
what
it
takes
to
keep
the
schools
good

that
's
always
been
a
high
priority

i
do

yeah

that
's
true

i
think
in
places
i
think
in
places
like
california
people
are
beginning
to
find
that
in
in
areas
that
are
fairly
well
off
if
you
add
the
uh
uh
people
of
various
sexual
persuasions
and
those
who
never
intend
to
marry
and
those
who
are
retired
and
those
are
uh
just
looking
for
fun
th-
people
with
families
turn
out
to
be
such
a
small
minority
that
they
ca
n't
get
a
tax
bill
passed
no
matter
what
happens

and
uh
there
are
big
sections
of
the
country
where
people
with
children
of
school
age
are
such
a
small
minority
that
they
ca
n't
get
anything
done

that
seems
a
a
like
a
cultural
lapse

i
mean
people
always
used
to
be
willing
to
ante
up
for
the
schools

they

right

yeah

people
would
rather
uh
increase
the
fire
department
and
cut
down
the
schools
because
it
means
more
to
them

but
i
think
it
's
sad
selfish
and
shortsighted

yeah

well

not
very
good

it
's
not
been
a
good
day

i
do
n't
know

i
finished
mine
up
about
eleven
and
left
it
here
with
carolyn

so
i
hope
she
's
turned
it
in

uh
i
ju-

go
ahead

i
'll
stop
eating

i
just
barely
got
home
from
the
university

i
just
barely
got
home
from
the
university

okay

go
ahead

fire
away

i
agree
with
you

huh

i
hate
the
eight
and
a
half
percent
sales
tax

but
on
the
other
hand
i
do
n't
mind
that
it
's
only
on
you
know
things
that
are
n't
like
groceries
and
that

it
's
not
on
that

oh
yeah

they
do

in
arizona

uh-huh

but
we
have
a
pretty
low
income
ta-
i
mean
pretty
low
tax
rate
here

oh
i
think
the
the
sales
tax
they
just
got
to
do
something
about
it

but
that
's
the
politicalness
of
trying
to
not
create
any
new
taxes

well
and
i
still
think
that
having
lived
in
europe
for
awhile
you
know
difference
in
living
conditions
are
certainly
well
worth
uh
what
we
pay
for
it

well
i
mean
i
think

i
was
in
germany
you
know
for
several
years

and
i
'd
a
lot
rather
pay
taxes
here
and
have
what
we
have
then
have
to
live
there

higher
taxes

yeah

still
's
that
way
to
some
extent

i
think
the
other
problem
is
you
know
it
it
's
easy
to
complain
about
taxes
because
there
's
something
you
theoretically
can
do
something
about

but
i
look
for
example

and
you
're
not
quite
in
the
same
situation

but
like
school
taxes
for
me
biggest
bargain
in
the
world

i
wish
i
did
n't
have
to
pay
any
more
fo-
to
my
physicians
in
a
year
than
i
had
to
pay
for
all
of
my
school
taxes

yeah

that
that
's
probably
a
little
tougher
on
you

no

i
think
that
's
just
you
though

yeah

of
course
i
think
with
the
graying
of
america
we
're
going
to
see
that
problem
in
lots
of
places

or
build
roads

okay

how
do
you
get
your
news
mostly

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
i
can
hardly
wait
for
my
morning
paper
to
come

so
that
's
the
first
thing
i
want
is
the
headlines

it
's
really
funny
because
because
uh
uh
my
sister
grabs
the
sports
and
i
grab
the
headlines

but
uh
and
then
when
five
o'clock
comes
around
i
just
want
to
get
in
the
house
and
turn
the
t
v
on
to
watch
the
news

it
's
really
weird

uh
i
do
n't
stay
up
late
to
watch
late
news
because
my
eyes
wo
n't
stay
up
that
long

but
uh
i
love
to
watch
the
five
o'clock
news

and
i
makes
me
angry
when
my
paper
boy
's
not
there
on
time
where
i
can
read
my
paper

uh
i
do
have
my
radio
going
most
of
the
day
though

so
about
every
hour
it
breaks
in
and
gives
me
news
too
you
know

but

no

uh-huh

jus-
i
just
have
a
channel
that
has
music
except
for
like
every
hour
you
know
say
eight
o'clock
nine
o'clock
they
come
on
for
just
a
little
bit
of
the
news

but
as
far
as
the
actual
news
i
get
that
from
from
the

can
you
hold
on
just
for
a
second

just
a
minute

hello
sir

yes

i
'm
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting

uh
i
was
calling
from
work

so
and
that
was
a
call
waiting

yeah

yo-

that
's
true
too

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

well
you
're
right

there
is
a
lot
of
it
that
's
that
's
just
garbage
as
far
as
i
'm
concerned
you
know

but
i
just
like
the
more
or
less
the
the
daily
news
you
know
just
uh
especially
the
weather

i
like
that

although
they
're
usually
wrong

uh-huh

but
uh
like
i
say
as
far
as
as
actually
listening
to
the
news
it
's
mostly
t
v
five
o'clock
to
six
thirty

uh
that
seems
like
a
long
time
for
news

but
that
's
how
long
it
is

and
uh
seems
like
they
have
the
local
news
and
they
have
the
world
news

and
then
uh
my
morning
paper
i
can
hardly
wait
for
it
to
come

and
uh

oh

yeah

right

once
you
get
to
work
i
would
n't
either

huh-uh

but
i
've
always
been
a
morning
person
to
get
up
you
know

an-
but
i
ca
n't
stay
up
late
at
night
to
watch
the
late
news

so
i
guess
that
's
why
i
watch
it
at
five
o'clock

but
anyhow
well
listen
i
guess
that
's
about
it
then

it
's
been
nice
talking
to
you
tony

oh
really

oh
well
that
has
n't
happened
to
me
yet

so
you
never
know

it
might
this
time

okay
tony

uh-huh

bye-bye

generally
i
get
most
of
my
news
from
uh
the
radio

and
then
sometimes
uh
if
i
've
got
time
i
'll
be
reading
the
front
page
of
the
newspaper
and
just
fall
off
on
the
articles
that
i
like

uh
also
since
my
wife
likes
to
watch
t
v
sometimes
uh
ju-
having
b-
just
being
there
i
get
uh
you
know
i
have
to
watch
the
news
late
at
night
with
t
v

how
about
you

uh-huh

uh-huh

um

um

okay

do
you
get
wh-
like
one
of
the
talk
stations
the
news
stations

sure

right

sure

yes

okay

right

s-
it
sounds
like
you
uh
like
the
news
a
lot
more
than
i
do

me
i
figure
if
it
's
something
really
important
somebody
will
tell
me
about
it

but
uh
you
know
i
the
thing
is
if
if
i
catch
the
news
all
the
time
it
just
makes
me
depressed
because
they
tend
to
produce
a
lot
of
bad
news

or
that
's
what
comes
on
first

and
uh
you
know
also
late
at
night
you
know
i
do
n't
wa-
like
watching
the
news
late
at
night

but
my
wife
is
usually
up
then

and
so
i
ca
n't
go
to
sleep
with
the
t
v
on

i
uh

but
you
know
i
i
wish
i
had
uh
more
news
on
things
like
that
i
consider
long
range
things
like
science
and
medicine

uh
i
'm
more
i
guess
i
'm
more
into
science
and
science
fiction

and
uh
there
's
you
know

not
that
the
news
is
science
fiction

but
uh
uh
i
'm
more
interested
in
that

things
like
uh
is
nasa
ready
for
another
space
shot
uh
you
know
how
hot
are
they
on
the
trail
of
a
cure
for
such
and
such
cancer

and
uh
uh
you
know
a
lot
of
the
news
is
n't
that
interesting
to
me

uh-huh

yeah

me
too

yeah

georgia
here
they
're
usually
wrong
too

we
have
weird
weather
systems

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

i
'm
you
know
i
i
just
uh
i
would

i
i
i
'm
not
a
morning
person

so
i
would
begrudge
the
time
it
takes
me
in
the
morning
to
catch
my
morning
news

i
get
up
just
barely
in
time
to
get
up
get
ready
and
get
off
to
work

and
then
at
work
i
have
no
time
to
read
the
news

no

uh-huh

yeah

okay

nice
talking
to
you

i
'll
probably
talk
to
you
again

i
had
a
friend
who
was
in
this

and
he
said
that
he
got
calls
from
the
same
caller
sometimes

yeah

that
's
right

take
it
easy

bye-bye

okay

do
you
have
a
budget
that
you
go
on

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
my
bills
i
usually
know
approximately
how
much
they
're
going
to
be

each
month
they
g-
are
more
or
less
just
about
the
same
you
know

uh
very
seldom
are
they
any
different

and
then
uh
like
for
groceries
and
everything
we
try
to
put
like
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
a
little
can
in
the
kitchen

and
then
that
's
what
we
use
to
buy
the
groceries
with

and
then
we
put
our
receipts
in
there
you
know

and
usually
that
's
enough

and
uh
but
i
do
n't
have
any
you
know
small
children
to
have
anything
extra
come
up
you
know
like
uh
running
to
the
doctor
or
something
like
that
with
them

yeah

yeah

right

in
fact
i
did
have
to
take
my
dog
to
the
vet
the
other
day

yeah

tha-
that
it
's
worse
than
having
a
kid
huh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

uh
i
'm
not
working
right
now

i
worked
for
p
i
e

and
then
uh
they
went
bankrupt

so
i
just
went
ahead
and
took
my
early
pension

but
i
only
get
that
once
a
month

yeah

yeah

so

yeah

so
you
know
i
really
have
to
try
to
budget
that
i
do
n't
go
over
that
amount
you
know
each
month

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

right

uh-huh

and

oh
yeah

right
now
it
's
terrible
is
n't
it

yeah

uh-huh

i
also
like
long-term
christmas
club
be-
you
know

i
used
to
belong
to
a
christmas
club

last
year
i
did
n't

then
so
then
naturally
christmas
comes
along

and
that
puts
you
behind
too
you
know

so
this
year
now
i
have
them
taking
out
fifty
dollars
a
month
out
of
my
checking
account
for
my
christmas
club

so
i
figure
you
know
that
's
going
to
help
some

yeah

right
you
know

right

right

and
i
'm
ta-

oh
that
's
good

i
'm
taking
like
uh
sewing
lessons
to
try
to
learn
how
to
sew
better
than
what
i
can

so
i
wo
n't
have
to
go
out
and
buy
the
ready-made
clothes
anymore

i
know

i
even
bought
myself
a
surgery
you
know

and
i
just
love
it

i
have
n't
learned
everything
to
do
on
it
yet

but
i
figure
that
will
help
me
save
you
know

uh-huh

yeah

well
see
some
people
are
some
are
n't

because
i
have
some
sisters
i
have
three
sisters

and
none
of
those
are
really
interested
in
sewing

yeah

and
then
i
can
also
you
know
do
some
crafts
and
sell
those
at
garage
sales

so
which
i
've
been
doing

uh-huh

oh
really

oh

well
have
you
called

oh

oh
it
is

oh
well
that
that
's
nice
you
know

uh-huh

yeah

well
i
guess
that
's
about
all
i
can
talk
to
about
budgets

when
i
was
working
i
uh
bought
a
bond
a
month
out
of
my
you
know

they
automatically
took
it
out
of
my
out
of
my
payroll

all
rightie

yeah

i
sure
do

uh
i
have
it
's
pretty
much
a
ledger
sheet

and
i
just
write
down
e-
all
my
bills
how
much
i
'm
going
to
have
to
pay

and
i
do
it
per
paycheck
for
me
which
is
every
other
week

uh
i
mean
i
include
everything
from
groceries
to
insurance
to
car
payments
to
credit
card
payments
you
know
everything

and
it
tends
to
work
out
pretty
well
that
way

i
can
anticipate
you
know
a
little
better

i
usually
try
to
guesstimate

and
then
when
the
bill
actually
comes
in
i
go
ahead
and
fill
in
the
actual
amount

that
way
i
know
how
much
pocket
change
i
'm
going
to
have
left
at
the
end
of
the
month
or
at
the
end
of
the
paycheck
anyway

so
that
works
okay
for
me

right

uh-huh

same
here

uh-huh

oh
okay

uh-huh

right

luckily
i
do
n't
either

i
mean
you
know
maybe
my
cat
would
get
sick

but
i
mean
usually
that
's
not
so
much
that
it
would
throw
me
off

but
you
so
you
know
what
i
'm
saying

yeah

i

sometimes
it
can
be

sometimes
it
can
be

i
guess
the
worst
thing
i
've
ever
had
come
out
is
like
car
maintenance
kinds
of
things

but
i
do
try
to
build
in
a
little
extra
money
each
month
to
to
be
able
to
do
that
type
of
thing

so

uh-huh

oh
uh-huh

oh
that
's
tough

my
roommate
only
gets
paid
once
a
month

and
that
last
week
's
pretty
lean
generally
speaking

so

right

i
for
for
years
got
paid
once
a
month

and
and
in
ways
i
liked
it
because
i
could
go
ahead
and
pay
all
my
bills
at
once

there
's
always
one
or
two
stragglers
that
usually
they
were

for
me
it
worked
out
that
they
were
the
smaller
ones

but
i
would
pay
all
of
them
at
one
sitting

and
i
would
know
okay
you
can
go
spend
this
much
on
groceries
now
and
you
get
this
much
a
week
and
that
is
it

and
and
it
worked
okay
for
me

i
do
n't
know

right
now
i
i
'm
in
the
mode
of
trying
to
dig
out
of
debt
i
think
as
everybody
is

and
so

it
's
yeah
it
's
really
bad

but
uh
it
's
going
pretty
well

and
i
've
got
a
real
good
plan
mapped
out
here

so

uh-huh

oh
that
's

yeah

that
'll
cover
your
gifts
come
christmas
time

that
'll

yeah

that
'll
be
good

yeah

most
people
are
spending
three
or
four
months
di-
you
know
at
least
digging
out
after
christmas

so

yeah

i
i
was
pretty
fortunate
this
christmas

i
did
n't
get
in
debt

so

uh-huh

oh
uh-huh

it
's
so
rare

you
hear
anybody
doing
that
any
longer

yeah

my
uh
roommate
does
sew
some

and
and
uh
i-
she
has
n't
sewed
anything
in
a
long
time

but
i
i
'm
sure
that
she
could
pick
it
up
again

my
mother
always
sewed

she
tried
to
teach
me
when
i
was
young
but
not
interested

yeah

yeah

but
that
's
a
real
good
way
to
save
money
though
by
doing
that

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
that
's
a
good
way
to
to
make
a
little
extra
money

well
this
is
another
way
that
i
'm
making
a
little
extra
money

so
that
was
you
know
nice
that
i
tripped
over
this
opportunity

and
you
're
actually
my
first
call

yeah

i
had
not
uh
done

i
i
guess
today
today
's
my
first
day
that
i
could
even
do
it

yeah

you
beat
me
to
the
punch
here

i
i
was
about
to
call
to
get
to
see
if
i
could
get
on
with
somebody

so

so
that
was
great

yeah

yeah

i
take
have
some
money
taken
it
and
put
in
a
four
oh
one
k

well
actually
i
love
the
car
i
have

i
have
a
chrysler
lebaron
convertible

and
i
love
it

and
i
would
get
another
one
in
a
minute

unless
i
could
afford
what
i
really
like
which
would
be
a
red
ferrari
or
you
know
a
little
corvette
or
something
like
that

and
that
's
what
would
influence
my
decision
to
change
because
i
like
a
really
sporty
car

and
i
'd
love
an
expensive
one

but
i
probably
can
never
afford
it

so

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

well
i
'm
a
nurse
here

and
we
have
a
doctor
at
this
hospital
that
has
a
beautiful
new
red
ferrari

and
i
could
n't
tell
you

but
it
's
just
beautiful

and
i
go
out
and
i
love
to
touch
it

but
i
ca
n't
even
do
that
because
of
the
alarm

so
i
just
look
at
it
a
lot

really

exactly

but
it
sure
is
a
pretty
thing

no

i
'm
working
on
it

no

i
really
have
n't

no

huh-uh

i
did
test
drive
a
corvette
last
year
maybe
the
year
before

it
was
brand
new
white

it
was
like
a
big
marshmallow

when
you
sat
in
the
seats
they
adjusted
to
fit
around
you

i
mean
they
came
in
and
up
and
out

and
i
mean
they
did
whatever

and
and
we
went
for
a
test
drive
in
that

and
i
was
able
to
open
that
up
pretty
good

and
that
was
really
fun

and
i
wanted
it

but
i
had
a
choice
of
that
or
my
house

and
i
thought
that
i
'd
continue
to
live
in
my
house

so

yeah

you
know
it
's
just
necessary

and
i
did
i
thought
well
a
tent
would
n't
be
bad
but
probably
not
practical

yeah

right

so

they
are
they
're
pretty
are
n't
they
lately

they
really
are

really

oh
no

no

no

see
i
'm
not
into
station
wagons
and
vans
and
things
that
people
are
really
buying
now

and
they
go
is
n't
that
a
nice
van

and
i
go
um

not
really
you
know

how
about
a
greyhound
bus

yeah

i
mean
that
you
know

there
's
some
that
are
prettier
than
others

and

yeah

the
new
type
is
prettier
than
what
their
they
used
to
look
like

but
i
sure
do
n't
think
it
's
attractive
you
know

it
's
not
like
like
driving
a
little
sports
car

yeah

i
do
n't
think
that
happens

so
but
i
i
love
mine

so
and
i
i
bought
it
because
i
drove
a
friend
's
in
hawaii

and
i
just
went
home

and
i
walked
in

and
i
picked
it
out

and
he
said
take
it
home
and
bring
it
back
if
you
want
to

and
i
never
did

i
just
went
back
and
signed
the
papers

and
i
knew
nothing
about
my
car
when
i
got
it

nothing

i
did
n't
know
how
anything
worked

yeah

and
i
've
had
it

it
's
almost
three
years
actually

and
i
've
i
still
love
it

i
put
the
top
down
everywhere
i
go

i
timed
it
when
i
first
got
it

and
it
took
twenty
min-
i
mean
twenty
seconds

and
so
i
figured
there
was
nowhere
i
was
to
late
to
go
that
i
did
n't
have
twenty
more
seconds

so

twenty
seconds

yeah

that
's
all
it
takes

i
mean
it
's
just
a
button
that
's
it

you
release
it
right
at
the
top

so
you
do
n't
have
to
get
out
or
anything

well
i
did
actually

last
week
going
to
the
airport

i
just
hit
a
downpour

and
i
was
on
a
highway
going
like
eighty

so
i
really
did

i
mean
i
was
soaking
wet

i
thought
i
would
drown
in
the
seconds
that
it
took
me
to
pull
over

but
it
all
dried
out
you
know
did
n't
take
long
when
the
sun
came
out

but
it
was
kind
of
funny

i
'm
sure
people
around
me
really
enjoyed
it

but

oh

and
was
n't
it
pretty
last
week
with
the
bluebonnets
and
everything

yeah

yeah

yeah

a
lot
of
people
say
that

and
it
's
pretty
far
from
where
i
live

so
what
sort
of
car
are
you
interested
in
getting
next

ah

uh
well
i
understand
and
can
sympathize
with
that
because
i
also
enjoy
driving
performance
automobiles

uh
i
currently
have
an
eighty-seven
five
liter
mustang
g
t
that
i
've
done
a
bunch
of
modifications
to
to
make
it
uh
handle
and
perform
better

and
i
suspect
if
i
were
to
be
able
to
get
another
car
where
object
was
uh

the
best
car
i
could
get
regardless
of
money
uh
i
probably
would
be
tempted
by
something
along
the
lines
of
a
lotus
or
possibly
a
ferrari

a
a
three
twenty-eight
g
t
s

you
just
go
hunting

go
out
and
lust
after
it

so
have
you
had
the
opportunity
to
drive
a
ferrari

uh

yeah

there
there
's
something
about
having
a
place
to
live

i
do
n't
know

could
sleep
in
the
back
of
the
'vette

i
find
that
uh
that
the
corvettes
are
are
becoming
really
really
nice
cars

yeah

and
they
they
've
improved
the
performance
and
the
suspension
such
that
they
're
actually
a
lot
of
fun
to
drive

it
's
not
like
driving
a
a
winnebago
or
something

nice

yeah

nice
is
n't
the
word
i
'd
choose

maybe
practical

is
n't
that
a
practical
van

yeah

it
it
's
very
hard
to
find
something
practical
that
's
also
attractive

well
so
it
was
a
completely
new
experience
for
you

and
i
'm
sure
you
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it

right

and
and
you
could
n't
get

how
long
does
it
take
to
go
back
up
about
the
same
time

yeah

so

so
you
wo
n't
get

yeah

and
twenty
seconds
you
probably
wo
n't
get
caught
in
anything
too
substantial

whoops

yeah

oh
no
i
was
just
down
in
austin
last
week

and
the
weather
was
pretty
nice
too

so

with
the
bluebonnets
out

yeah

it
really
was

yeah

i
decided
that
austin
is
certainly
someplace
that
i
could
handle
living

i
'm
ready
if
you
are

well
i
think
that
people
should
be
allowed
to
have
them

especially
if
they
go
hunting

which
my
son
goes
hunting

he
goes
deer
hunting

he
goes
duck
hunting

uh
he
's
read
books
about
guns
since
he
was
like
probably
eleven
or
twelve
years
old

and
i
just
think
that
uh
as
far
as
that
's
concerned
he
should
be
able
to
have
them
to
go
hunting
with
you
know

as
far
as
just
having
handguns
around
to
to
have
them
i
do
n't
believe
that
you
should
have
handguns
around

well
no

there
's
too
many
sports
people
out
there
that
that
do
do
these
things

yeah

well
i
suppose
you
could
uh

uh-huh

and
i
think
if
they
want
one
they
're
going
to
get
one

you
know

the
bad
guys
are
you
know

like
i
say
if
they
want
a
gun
they
're
going
to
find
out
somehow
to
get
one

well
i
agree
with
you
on
that
because
i
know
uh

in
fact
i
had
bought
my
son
a
rifle
like
for
a
christmas
present
one
time

and
for
a
rifle
there
's
no
waiting

there
was
n't
anyhow

now
there
might
be
now

but
there
was
n't
anything
for
you
know
rifles
and
things
like
that

i
guess
it
was
just
handguns
that
there
was
a
some
kind
of
a
waiting
you
know
two
weeks
while
they
checked
you
out
or
something

but
uh
most
of
these
people
that
's
got
these
guns
that
's
going
around
you
know
robbing
people
and
shooting
people

uh-huh

uh-huh

i
see
now
i
know
they
were
having
a
gun
show
about
a
month
ago

and
i
was
just
wondering
how
that
did
work
if
somebody
wanted
to
buy
a
gun
at
a
gun
show

there
's
no
restriction
though

you
do
n't
have
to
wait
or
nothing
then
huh

yeah

i
was
just
curious
you
know
because
uh

i
know
at
at
the
regular
gun
show
you
know
gun
shop
that
you
that
you
do
have
to
wait
for
pistols
like
a
couple
of
weeks

and
then
they
check
you
out

then
they
call
you
up

and
you
h-
go
pick
it
up

which
i
think
they
have
to
do
on
rifles
and
things
now
too

i
think
there
is
some
something
like
that

anyhow
here
out
here
in
california
i
think
there
is
now

but

uh-huh

now
we
do
n't
have
guns
because
we
do
n't
go
hunting
or
anything
like
that

but
like
i
say
my
son
he
's
he
's
always
had
a

like
i
think
his
first
little
rifle
that
we
got
him
was
like
he
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old

but
he
's
always
he
went
to
the
to
the
school
to
learn
how
to
shoot
it

he
goes
to
the
pistol
range

and
th-
and
the
rifle
range
to
shoot
them

he
likes
to
go
to
that
uh
shotgun
thing
where
you
shoot
at
those
uh

yeah

right

he
likes
to
do
that
you
know

but
uh
i
do
n't
know

i
think
they
should
try
to
control
it
and
everything
you
know

but
as
far
as
just
banning
it
completely
there
that
's
not
going
to
happen

uh-huh

yeah

right

right

now
i
do
believe
though
like
in
california
if
a
little
kid
gets
a
hold
of
a
gun
that
someone
has
i
think
they
're
liable
now
for

they
can
be
you
know
put
in
jail
and
everything
the
whoever
owned
the
gun

you
know
now
when
they
have
kids
around
you
'd
think
that
they
would
be
locking
them
up

or
you
know

uh-huh

well
they
can
get
into
almost
anything
anymore

okay

um
wh-
where
do
you
stand
uh
on

oh

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

right

right

yeah

yeah

yeah

i
agree
too

i
uh

it
's
it
's
as
far
as
the
ban
goes
and
everything
i
do
n't
think
it
's
possible
uh
to
completely
ban
guns

there
's
just
too
many

right

and
i

yeah

right

i
mean

yeah

that
that
's
true

and
i
mean
the
the
technology
's
not
that
hard

i
mean
you
could
make
a
gun
you
know
from
simple
you
know
you
know

you
know
if
if
you
really
wanted
a
gun
you
you
could
make
one
uh

oh
you
know

true

that
's
true

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

it
's

yeah

i
mean

yeah

there
's
there
's
no
way
to
stop
uh
stop
anybody
from
getting
a
gun

uh
i
think
there
should
be
more
control
as
like
uh
like
maybe
waiting
periods
and
things
like
that
you
know
uh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

sure

yeah

right

uh-huh

yeah

uh
i
i
know
my
friend
is
uh
really
into
guns

and
uh
uh
w-
i
went
a
couple
of
times
with
him
to
gun
shows
you
know
that
come
through
town
and
everything

and
i
mean
they
just
have
i
mean
they
have
anything
you
'd
want

i
mean

you
know
you
know
anywhere
from
rifles
and
semiautomatic
weapons
and
there
's
i
mean
there
's
nothing

you
can
just
go
buy
one
and
take
it
home

and
it
's
easier
than
getting
a
like
a
video
membership
card
at
you
know
a
video
store

uh
yeah

yeah

you
just
go
and
uh
buy
the
gun

and
uh

no

well
except
for
the
the
pistols
and
th-

i
'm
not
sure
how
they
do
that

i
know
they

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

yeah

i
think
that
's

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

i
'm
not
sure

i
'm
not
really
sure
but
what
uh
th-
the
gun
laws
in
p-
pennsylvania
are
like

no

uh-huh

uh-huh

oh
yeah

the
skeets
you
mean

uh-huh

yeah

i
do
n't
yeah
i
i
do
n't
think
it
can
happen
either

i
just
do
n't
i
do
n't
see

and
then
i
i
think
uh
had
n't
thought
about
this
before

but
if
you
do
that
if
they
would
uh
uh
decide
to
ban
guns
it
would
just
open
up
a
a
market
you
know
a
black
market
for
them

and
so
you
know
they
they
would
just

all
the
profits
would
go
to
you
know

yeah

oh
th-
oh
yeah

the
owner
's
responsibility

yeah

yeah

yeah

you
know
that
's
that
's
true

uh
you
know
i
i
had
a
friend
who
was
a
uh
a
policeman
in
a
in
a
local
borough
just
a
small
uh
one
of
the
little
neighborhoods
you
know
one
of
the
small
towns
uh
near
pittsburgh

and
uh
she
said
tha-
that
that
uh
you
know
he
used
to
always
keep
his
guns
locked
up
and
everything
like
that

but
i
mean
you
know
you
're
you
know

people
make
you
know

they
forget
or
you
know
you
know

kids
get
in

the
way
kids
the
way
kids
are
you
know
i
mean
they
can
you
know

right

okay
uh
let
me
see

unfortunately
we
are
not
much
into
recycling

we
do
n't
we
do
n't
do
enough

i
know
we
do
n't
so

uh
although
lately
i
've
been
uh

a
friend
of
mine
that
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
does
recycle
quite
a
bit

and
it
's
it
's
it
's
uh
interesting
to
watch
some
of
the
things
that
she
does

and
then
she
's
almost
had
an
impact
on
me
uh
where
she
does
n't
say
anything
to
me
when
she
comes
to
my
house
but
i
can
kind
of
tell
it
bothers
her
so
just
unconsciously
i
've
i
've
stopped
buying
a
lot
of
uh
uh
paper
plates
and
paper
cups

and
i
do
n't
do
that
anymore

i
do
n't
know
why

i
just
do
n't
i
just
just
from
socializing
with
her

so

it
really
it
there
's
not
a
whole
lot

there
really
is
n't

uh
i
know
in
my
mother
's
neighborhood
in
san
antonio
each
each
house
has

they
're
they
're
given
three
baskets

and
they
put
them
out
on
a
certain
day
of
the
week

and
each
uh
home
does
participate

but
we
really
do
n't
have
anything
uh
close
in
this
area
that
that
do
anything

and
and
some
of
the
communities
that
do
the
residents
are
having
to
pay
to
participate
in
it
which
really
does
n't
make
sense

yeah

that
's
good

yeah

yeah

that
's
another
thing

you
have
to
go
to
different
places
to
do
that

uh-huh

but
i
heard
that
most
homes
that
do
participate
in
that
are
having
to
pay
a
monthly
fee
to
do
that
which
uh

i
do
n't
know

it
just
does
n't
make
sense
to
me

yeah

yeah

yeah

that
's
good

that
's
good

uh-huh

huh

no

oh
i
did
n't
know
that

yeah

uh-huh

well
that
's
good

i
i
'm
you
know

unfortunately
garland
does
n't
have
does
n't

they
do
n't
i
do
n't
know
they
do
n't
do
anything
like
that

or
i
you
know
i
read
those
little
slips
that
come
in
to
your
utility
bills
or
your
uh
garbage
collection

and
they
have
n't
you
know
talked
about
doing
something
like
that

she
lives
in
garland

and
i
'm
not
sure
where
what
she
does

but
she
's
uh
oh
she
's
ve-
very
heavy
in
that

and
she
takes
her
own
bags
to
the
grocery
store

uh
she
has
i
i
really
do
n't
think
she
has
any
paper
products
in
her
house

uh
and
just
a
lot
of
things
i
've
learned
off
of
her
that
to
start
doing

and
she
does
make
a
lot
of
sense

just
her
whole
house
is
like
wow

yeah

yeah

yeah

and
uh
my
little
boy
has
watches
a
program
that
was
really
neat

i
sat
and
watched
him

you
know
the
barney

you
know
the
little
i
do
n't
know
if
you
know
the
little
character
barney

they
had
one
uh
on
that
kind
of
type
of
thing

and
how
children
can
can
do
that

and
how
to
save
water
b-
when
you
brush
your
teeth
in
water

and
it
's
really
caught
on

and
he
's
only
four

and
he
's
really
caught
on

and
keep
the
refrigerator
door
closed
and
that
kind
of
thing

he
's
really
caught
on

so
that
's
really
neat

uh-huh

how
do
you
how
uh
is
recycling
done
in
your
community

is

uh-huh

right

oh

right

over
here
they
uh
have
several
private
companies
that
you
can
take
uh
recycled
materials
to

but
uh
if
you
want
to
take
them
all
to
one
place
they
have
uh
the
first
saturday
of
every
month
they
have
certain
places
that
you
can
drop
them
off

that
's
what
i
do

uh
and
i
i
recycle
aluminum
glass
uh
newspapers

so
it
's
nice
to
have
you
know
one
place
that
you
can
take
them
all
to
instead
of
driving
the
glass
to
one
place

and
right

right

so
it
's
so
that
's
nice

it
would
be
it
would
be
really
nice
if
they
uh
came
to
the
house
to
pick
it
up

and
they
just
were
talking
about
a
bill
in
tucson
about
that

but
uh
uh
it
did
n't
go
through

right

i
guess
what
they
what
they
were
talking
about
here
was
uh
was
reducing
the
garbage
collection
in
order
to
make
that
up
or
something
you
know

uh
so
i
guess
that
's
one
option

i
guess
one
thing
they
're
working
on
now
is
recycling
plastics
too

like
uh

have
you
noticed
that
on
the
bottom
of
plastic
goods
they
have
this
little
number
now
that
tells
what
kind
of
plastic
it
is

yeah

i
guess
the
problem
with
plastic
is
there
's
so
many
different
kinds
that
you
ca
n't
recycle

you
ca
n't
just
throw
all
plastic
into
one
recycler

yeah

so
now
they
're
like
marking
uh

they
're

i
do
n't
know

there
's
six
seven
eight
different
kind
of
plastics

and
they
they
mark
on
the
bottom
what
kind
it
is

so
i
guess
that
makes
it
easy
to
recycle

and
then
they
're
they
're
uh
trying
to
make
plastic
goods
that
do
n't
have
a
bunch
of
different
plastics
in
them
you
know
that
are
that
are
only
made
out
of
one
kind
of
plastic

so
that
that
makes
it
easier
i
guess

right

where
does
your
friend
go
to
to
recycle

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

i
guess
that
's
how
it
gets
passed
on
you
know
when
one
person
you
hear
from
another
person

and
then
uh
and
then
you
and
then
you
pass
it
on

it
seems
to
be
catching
on
uh
slowly
but
surely
i
guess

uh-huh

uh-huh

wow

that
's
cute

that
's
neat

yeah

when
you

well
when
you
start
early
i
guess

okay

do
you
work
with
a
company
that
uh
gives
drug
testing

oh
they
do

uh-huh

what
uh

did
they
do
that
before
you
went
in
or
what

oh
they
will
huh

oh

okay

well
i
've

i
worked

i
do
n't
work
right
now
because
my
company
i
worked
for
p
i
e
went
bankrupt

but
uh
they
was
getting
a
program
set
up
that
for
all
new
hires
they
was
going
drug
uh
give
them
drug
tests

but
uh
they
did
n't
hire
very
many
new
hires
because
all
the
people
that
usually
work
there
you
know
just
stayed
there
because
it
was
they
had
been
there
for
a
long
long
time

but
uh
actually
i
think
they
should
do
it

you
know
uh
i
do
n't
think
anybody
needs
anybody
that
's
to
be
working
for
them
that
's
on
drugs
of
any
kind
you
know

but
uh
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
believe
that
they
should
just
randomly
do
it

i
think
they
should
kind
of
warn
them
like
you
know
well
we
're
going
to
do
that
or
maybe
tell
them
before
they
do
get
hired
you
know
that
this
is
what
is
going
to
happen

and
then
if
you
do
n't
like
it
why
then
you
know
you
'll
have
to
go
look
for
a
job
someplace
else

well
i
suppose
you
are
right
there
too
you
know

uh
personally
i

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

uh-huh

well
i
suppose
they
fire
you
and
everything
right
then
huh

or
what
do
they
do
with
you
guys
if
that
you
guys
get

oh
i
oh
i
see

yeah

well
i
do
n't
either

i
would
n't
even
think
about
it

i
think
anybody
that
does
them
are
dumb
you
know

yeah

really

you
're
so
stupid
god

and
you
just
watch
it
on
t
v
and
see
how
it
just
burns
your
brain
completely
up
you
know

you
do
n't

yeah

re-
really
dumb
huh

but
uh
let
's
see
what
else
was
i
going
to
say
here

yeah

i
think
so

i
think
they
all
should
test
really
you
know

uh
it
just
seems
like
there
is
so
much
more
of
it
going
on
anymore
that
i
do
n't
know
what
's
wrong
with
the
people
uh

but
i
think
that
the
the
government
should
do
something
about
stopping
it
completely

about
it
coming
into
our
country

you
know
they
just
slap
somebody
's
little
hand

and
you
know
well
do
n't
do
that
again

and
and
then
th-
you
know
they
'll
get
out

and
they
're
right
back
at
it
again

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

but
uh
other
than
that
why
i
do
n't
know

like
i
say
maybe
one
of
these
days
i
'll
get
a
job
because
i
am
looking
still
for
a
part-time
job
you
know
since
my
company
went
bankrupt

and
i
'll
see
what
they
do
you
know

but
like
i
say
i
i
would
n't
care
because
i
i
do
n't
i
do
n't
even
smoke

so
they
can
test
me
all
i
want

i
wonder
what
if
you
take
medicine
if
that
would
effect
it

yeah

see
now
that
that
would
be
really
unfair
then
huh

you
know

yeah

find
out
what
you
know
if
you
have
been
taking
some
kind
of
medication
and
you
know
if
that
would
effect
it
and
everything

but
uh
well
i
guess
that
's
about
all
we
can
talk
about

i
think
our
five
minutes
is
about
up
anyhow

okay
lewis

and
maybe
i
'll
talk
to
you
again

alrighty

bye-bye

bye

hi

sort
of

i
'm
a
i
'm
a
student

but
uh
i
'm
in
the
national
guard

and
they
do
a
little
bit
of
drug
testing

yeah

uh
they
they
do
it
before
you
go
in

and
occasionally
they
'll
have
a
a
random
urinalysis

yeah

so
you
ca
n't
be
smoking
marijuana
in
in
the
military
anymore

oh

oh

uh-huh

yeah

i
i
believe
they
should
too

uh-huh

yeah

definitely

oh

uh

but
after
you

you
have
to
do
randomly
otherwise
people
will
cheat

yeah

they

i
know
when
i
was
doing
my
uh
basic
training
in
a
i
t
there
was
guys
who
would
fool
around

and
then
when
that
urinalysis
came
around
they
would
be
all
scared

so
it
does
work
it
is
effective

the
only
problem
is
you
know
if
you
have
done
drugs
but
you
've
stopped
and
uh
you
do
get
caught
it
is
kind
of
kind
of
harsh

yeah

uh
we
get
counseling

and
uh
i
think
part
of
our
pay
is
docked
if
we
're
first
time
offenders

i
really
do
n't

i
i
have
n't

i
do
n't
do
any
drugs

so
i
do
n't
know

crazy

yeah

yeah

yeah

wastes
your
future

yeah

uh
what
do
you
think
about
our
uh
like
uh
other
government
agencies
testing

do
you
think
our
government
agencies
should
test

yeah

yeah

oh
i
know

yeah

they
are
n't

yeah

right
now
it
is
it
's
too
lucrative
for
the
drug
dealers

so
th-
the
risks
are
worth
it
for
them

yeah

yeah

yeah

oh
see
that
's

tha-

it
is
a
problem

sometimes
some
medicines
will
give
off
a
a
false
positive

i
've
heard
of
i
've
heard
of
that

yeah

yeah

i
believe
you
should
have
the
testing

but
they
should
be
like
if
you
get
if
you
get
a
positive
they
should
double
check
you
and
still
give
you
the
benefit
of
a
doubt

uh-huh

yeah

well
it
was
nice
talking
to
you
rose

okay

bye-bye

okay
uh

we
keep
a
monthly
budget

i
just
recently
stopped
working
so
i
can
be
home
with
my
kids

so
we
keep
a
monthly
budget

and
we
try
to
stick
to
it

yeah

yeah

that
's
the
kind
of
things
that
throw
you
off

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

oh
how
nice

yeah

yeah

yeah

well
i
know

we
do

my
husband
gets
paid
twice
a
week

and
so
we
pay
all
of
the
little
bills
uh
one
paycheck
and
then
like
the
mortgage
and
the
electric
bill
you
know
those
big
bills
the
second
second
pay

and
then
again
he
does
have
a
savings
that
comes
out
you
know
for
christmas
and
stuff
that
kind
of
thing

yeah

that
kind
of
thing

but
it
's
nice
that
it
's
there
you
know

yeah

yeah

yeah

it
's
nice
that
it
's
there

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

that
's
kind
of
how
i
felt
when
i
was
working
because
it
seemed
like
we
spent
more

we
bought
more
things

and
it
seemed
like
we
spent
more

then
a
lot
of
it
was
going
to
uh
daycare
and
that
kind
of
thing

so
it
just
seems
like
with
me
staying
home
we
had
that
big
cut

but
we
save
more

i
do
n't
know
how

and
i
do
n't
know
why

but
we

it
seems
like
we
do

yeah

yeah

you
kind
of
try
and
buy
bigger
quantities

yeah

that
's
how
i
felt
too

it
just

you
could
take
a
little
longer
and
just
watch
a
little
bit
more
i
guess

i
guess
that
's
kind
of
like
the
way
we
do

we

i
i
do
n't
i
do
n't
know
how
it
comes
out

it
just
seems
like
we
save
a
little
bit
more
whereas
where
i
was
working

oh

yeah

yeah

yeah

it
adds
up

yeah

it
is

it
is

yeah

uh-huh

i
have
two

one
is
four
and
a
half

and
the
other
one
's
two
and
a
half

so

yes

yeah

that

yeah

i
just
came
back
to
find
jeans
for
the
little
one

and
it
does
add
up

yeah

but
uh

yeah

yeah

yeah

well
that
that
's
that
's
hard

but
i
'm
enjoying
my
stay
home
for
the
little
time
that
i
can

for
the

i
know
it
's
not
forever

and
that
's
what
's
so
sad

but

i
know

it
it
's
really
difficult
here
all
because
there
's
always
something
breaking

car
needs
tires
or
you
know
something

uh
uh
we
do
ours
more
monthly
than
long
range

uh
we
uh

my
husband
gets
paid
once
a
month

and
when
he
gets
paid
i
pay
all
the
bills

and
out
of
his
check
they
take
a
savings

and
out
of
my
check
they
take
savings
and
retirement
both
out
of
both
checks

so
as
far
as
extra
savings
we
really
do
n't
have
that
much
extra
to
save

uh
his
check
once
a
month
pays
all
the
bills

my
check
weekly
buys
groceries
and
gas
and
you
know
that
kind
of
thing

and
it
works
out
real
well
that
way

we
do
n't
run
into
a
lot
of
problems

but
budgets
are
horrible

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

yeah

when
the
car
insurance
is
due
and
you
call
the
credit
union
and
tell
them
well
send
me
some
money

yeah

it
uh
it
would
be
nice
if
we
did
n't
have
to
touch
the
money
he
has
taken
out
and
put
in
savings

but
we
do

yeah

it

i
'm
just
glad
that
it
is
there
for
car
insurance
medical
bills
whatever
happens

but
uh

i
know

but
i

you

it
's
just
really
is
difficult

uh
neither
one
of
us
has
had
a
raise
in
a
couple
of
years

and
of
course
the
cost
of
living
keeps
going
up
so
much

groceries
are
outrageous

and
i
keep
saying
my
check
does
less
and
less

but

uh-huh

yeah

well
i
uh
i
know
that
since
i
do
work
i
buy
a
lot
of
quicker
cuts
of
meat
and
uh
well
the
frozen
things
for
the
microwave
and
things
like
that

and
i
'll
stop
by
the
deli
and
pick
up
uh
chicken
or
whatever
where
if
i
did
not
work
i
'm
sure
that
the
grocery
bill
could
be
managed
a
lot
a
lot
uh
better

yeah

well
y-

well
i
'm
sure
you
do

uh
i
do
not
well
i
do
not
have
to
pay
child
care
during
the
winter

my
son
's
old
enough
that
he
likes
to
come
home
uh
from
school

but
in
the
summer
he
's
still
young
enough
that
i
cannot
leave
him
by
himself

so
in
the
summer
i
have
that
extra

and
ours
is
seventy
dollars
a
week
plus
all
activities

and
that
's
usually
movies
one
day
skating
one
day

swimming
one
day

yes

so
you
usually
end
up
paying
close
to
eighty
dollars
a
week

and
that
's
a
lot
of
money

but
you
know
if
they
're
going
to
be
in
daycare
then
they
need
to
have
some
activities
other
than
just
being
there

ho-

do
you
have
two
children

well
they
're
expensive
too
uh
just
the
outgrowing
of
their
clothes

so
i
'm
sure
the
budget

yeah

and
medical
bill

although
the
insurance
we
had
was
good
uh
when
thomas
was
younger
a
lot
of
the
stuff
had
to
be
paid
up
front

and
then
you
were
reimbursed

so
it
was
nice
when
you
'd
get
a
couple
of
hundred
dollar
check
from
the
insurance

but
in
the
meantime
you
had
to
put
out
the
money
first

but

yeah

it
is

oh
i
would
too

i
would
i
would
advise
anyone
that
could
possibly
do
it
to
to

well
you
probably
would
n't
want
to
do
it
forever

i
do
n't
know
though

okay
uh

well
we
just
got
our
income
tax
return

and
i
'm
perfectly
happy

what
about
you

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

but
as
far
as
writing
checks
out
and
paying
taxes
i
think
it
's
pretty
high

but
i
i
'm
you
know

i
i
guess
it
's
where
we
have
to
be
where
it
we
have
to
keep
raising
them
for
to
keep
some
of
the
things
that
that
we
have
and
it
's
just
scary
though
about
you
know

how
high
are
the
taxes
going
to
be
when
my
children
are
my
age

you
know
that
that
's
that
's
scary
too

because
it
's
not
anything
like
the
way
it
was
when
i
was
young
and
small
and
a
child

so
you
know
that
that
's
a
scary
part
too
that
you
have
to
think
about

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

and
then
you
find
out
about
all
these
things
about
are
your
taxes
you
know
taxpayers
are
is
your
money
going
to
where
you
want
it
to
go

and
there
's
going
to
a
special
this
week

i
i
ca
n't
i
ca
n't
if
it
's
twenty
twenty
or
one
of
those
things
where

uh
i
think
it
's
one
of
the
local
news

i
think
they
're
having
a
documentary
something
about
that

about
their
trying
to
catch
some
people
that
not
spending
your
tax
monies
right
and
fraud
and
that
kind
of
thing
you
know

and
that
's
kind
of
scary
too

and
uh
so
that
would
be
interesting
to
see

i
wanted
to
see
that
program

oh
i
know

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

huh

well
you
sure
do
know
a
l-
a
lot

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

that
's
true

what
do
you
think
about
these
items
that
are
going
to
be
uh
taxed
even
more
like
uh
tobacco
and
that
kind
of
thing

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

right

oh
really

well
let
's
see

i
have
n't
got
mine
yet
because
my
parents
are
getting
all
that
stuff
at
uh
at
home
in
the
bay
area

so
i
'm
not
sure
how
much
i
'm
getting
back

but
i
'm
pretty
sure
i
should
get
back
a
little
bit
since
student

so

it
's
not
too
much

not
too
bad
though

yeah

it
it
's
one
of
those
necessities
of
life
that
we
all
have
to
you
know
pay
taxes
but
although
it
is
kind
of
a
pain
sometimes
though

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

and
and
like
as
time
goes
on
you
know
things
get
more
expensive

and
because
we
were
increasingly
complex
society
that
day
by
day
things
get
more
uh
things
get
more
expensive
as
well
as
more
complex

and
you
know
taxes
are
one
of
the
ways
to
help
pay
for
a
lot
of
the
things
that
are
needed
in
this
society

i
mean
everything
from
you
know
from
medicare
to
uh
to
social
security
to
uh
to
feeding
the
h-
to
uh
to
you
know
feeding
the
homeless
to
maintaining
prisons
to
maintaining
polices
or
fire
departments
and
things
like
that

and
it
's

now
there
's
more
and
more
things
that
need
attending
to
and
that
sort
of
thing

and
you
know
it
's
it
's
becoming
a
larger
responsibility

but
someone
has
to
pay
for
it

and
that
's
us

uh-huh

yeah

and
and
even
even
today
it
's
like
the
amount
of
taxes
that
you
know
we
're
paying
for

but
you
'd
think
that
we
're
still
in
that

this
this
uh
deficit
state
that

we
're
still
not
able
to
pay
off
things
just
because
the
budget
's
not
big
enough
as
it
is

and
makes
you
wonder
when
there
's
you
know
countries
out
there
that
have
you
know
tax
rates
of
like
close
to
fifty
percent
or
higher

you
know
it
's
like
fifty
percent
of
everything
you
make
is
already
gone
before
you
even
get
it

and
that
that
's
kind
of
a
scary
thought

i
hope
it
does
n't
come
down
to
that

but
on
the
other
hand
they
also
while
those
countries
that
have
high
taxes
also
have
things
like
uh
socialized
medicine
things
like
that
too
which
are
nice
fringe
benefits
of
it

so
everyone
has
everyone
has
the
access
to
medical
facilities
as
well
as
the
doctors
that
sort
of
thing

and
it
's
good

but
it
's
it
's
the
price
they
pay

i
mean
it
can
be
argued
one
way
or
another
whether
economically
it
's
actually
good
for
the
country
or
good
for
any
given
country
to
have
that
because
those
countries
tend
to
be
uh
as
far
as
cash
flow
a
lot
uh
have
be
tend
to
have
a
much
slower
cash
flow
and
do
n't
generate
a
larger
a
a
large
amount
of
revenue
because
there
's
so
little
uh
currency
flow
through
out
the
economic
system

well
just
keeping
up
with
the
times
that
's
all

as
as
it
turns
out
you
know
it
's
one
of
those
one
of
those
interests
you
know
i
kind
of
like
to
keep
up
on

because
well
it
's
nice
to
know
that
when
i
'm
actually
you
know
i
do
start
working
that
i
like
to
know
where
my
tax
dollars
are
going
too

work
hard
to
get
you
know

i
like
to
know
where
it
's
going
to

uh-huh

i
think
in
a
in
a
way
it
's
good
in
a
way
it
's
not

uh
but
i
think
in
general
it
's
probably
good

i
mean
a
lot
of
things
like
tobacco
and
alcohol
and
things
like
that
have
been
have
been
in
the
past
uh
have
been
not
taxed
because
there
's
been
such
a
large
lobby
against
them
against
the
taxes
for
them
sponsored
by
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
companies

and
it
's
things
like
tobacco
are
uh
they
're
they
're
a
proven
health
hazard
to
smokers
as
well
as
nonsmokers

and
it
's

as
far
as
the
safety
thing
in
like
in
san
luis
obispo
for
example
there
's
an
ordnance
which
states
that
uh
there
's
no
smoking
in
any
public
areas

and
so
if
you
walk
into
any
restaurant
or
any
hotel
there
's
no
smoking
allowed
anywhere

okay

uh
i
just
currently
quit
my
job

and
so
i
really
do
n't
receive
any
benefits
right
now

but
my
husband
does

and
uh
i
think
one
of
the
uh
my

first
of
all
always
salary
and
se-

the
second
thing
is
uh
because
we
have
children

so
it
would
be
uh
health
benefits
and
medical
benefits

and
and
uh
right
now
we
have
probably
some
excellent
benefits
right
now

we
have
with
aetna

and
uh
i
do
n't
know
if
you
're
familiar
with
them

but
we
're
real
happy
with
them

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

yeah

huh

right

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

right

uh
and
and
and
another
good
thing
is
with
the
health
benefits
when
they
give
you
more
than
two
choices
on
who
to
go
with

and
that
really
helped
us
out
a
great
deal

so

but
my
husband
does
get
vacation

and
it
's
worked
out
really
good
for
us
too

so

but

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
that
's
great
that
you
all
can
work
that
out

that
's
really
good

right

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

it
's
the
same
with
my
husband
cause
he
's
got
pretty
flexible
hours
if
as
long
as
he
puts
in
the
hours
he
needs
to
do

worked
out
really
well
for
us
too

uh
well
is
there
anything
else
that
you
look
for

or

you
've
hit
pretty

you
've
put
a
lot
of
the
main
points
in

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

and
that
does
make
a
wan-
a
person
want
to
stay

right

yeah

yeah

definitely

yeah

yeah

i
've
had
a
variety
of
different
jobs
with
a
various
types
uh
in
the
computer
field

and
so
i
've
seen
a
variety
of
types
of
benefits

uh
i
've
worked
for
for
for
awhile

and
they
are
you
know
a
really
academic
type
of
place

and
then
i
've
worked
with
regular
you
know
industry
type
places
and
then
with
others
that
are
kind
of
half
way
between
and
stuff

so
i
've
seen
a
wide
range
of
both
you
know
nonsalary
type
benefits
and
other
stuff
you
know
like
health
care
that
's
either
fully
or
partially
paid

and
you
know
some
have
like
bonuses

and
others
have
had
lots
of
vacation
time
but
not
much
other
types
of
benefits

and
so
yeah
i
would

i
'd
say
health
care
is
way
up
there
especially
anybody
with
kids

uh
and
that
's
one
of
the
big
things
that
we
always
look
at
you
know
when
we
when
i
think
about
t-
changing
jobs
is
you
know
you
know
what
kind
of
health
care
they
have

and
does
the
company
pay
for
it
you
know
all
or
partially

or
how
does
that
work

and
uh
also
uh
vacation
time
too
is
a
is
a
big
one
for
me
uh
and
i
guess
support
for
whatever
whatever
other
you
know
kinds
of
professional
activities
you
have
at
you
know
work

uh
cause
i
've
been
at
places
which
offer
a
lot
of
support
and
others
that
do
n't
offer
any
and
some
that
sometimes
that
's
coincided
with
a
place
that
offers
more
vacation
time
though

so
that
's
not
so
bad
you
know

you
know
it
's
kind
of
a
give
and
take
kind
of
thing
i
think

uh
i
say
that
health
care
is
probably
definitely
number
one
though

want
to
just
you
know
all
your
salary
ca
n't
even
begin
to
pay
for
what
you
can
wind
up
losing
you
know
in
a
major
illness
or
something
uh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

flexible
hours
are
are
pretty
important
to
me
as
well

uh
cause
that
makes
a
big
difference

my
wife
works
part-time

and
she
works
uh
as
a
assistant
manager
in
a
fabric
store

and
so
she
works
a
lot
of
evenings
and
weekends

and
so
two
days
a
week
i
uh
manage
to
get
home
early
enough
to
meet
the
kids
on
the
bus

so
she
wor-
you
know
goes
in
early
those
days
and
works
like
you
know
noon
til
close

uh
so
we
have

yeah

and
being
on
a
you
know
rigid
schedule
would
n't
there
would
n't
be
anyway
to
do
that
at
all

and
i
think
it
's
kind
of
neat
to
be
able
to
spend
the
afternoons
with
the
kids
occasionally
too

i
mean
usually
you
know
you
go
to
work
before
they
're
awake
or
as
they
're
getting
up
for
school

and
you
get
home

and
it
's
already
dark
unless
it
's
summer
time
you
know

and
even
in
summer
time
sometimes
you
get
home
so
late
that
there
's
you
know
you
ca
n't
do
anything
with
them

and
especially
in
the
winter
i
mean
you
g-
get
up
in
the
dark
and
come
home
in
the
dark
you
know

it
's
like
it
's
like
a
vampire
sometimes

yeah

uh
a
lot
of
i
guess
is

yeah

i
think
some
of
is
how
the
uh
you
know

i
guess
it
's
not
really
a
direct
benefit
but
how
your
uh
performance
is
rated
and
stuff
like
that
at
work

cause
i
've
been
uh

especially
in
large
corporations
you
can
really
you
know
wind
up
getting
having
you
know
real
problems
i
've
found
out

i
've
worked
for
a
few
you
know
several
thousand
plus
you
know
type
companies
and
it
and
especially
if
you
're
doing
like
professional
work
where
i-
you
know
it
's
kind
of
ethereal
as
to
what
you
're
doing
you
know

if
you
're

like
i
've

i
work
with
uh
computer
systems
a
lot

so
it
's
kind
of
hard
to
say
you
know

if
you
're
you
know
a
brick
layer
somebody
can
look
and
see
you
know
well
yeah
you
laid
you
know
fifteen
thousand
bricks
today

and
they
were
all
straight

and
your
building
did
n't
fall
down
you
know

yeah

you
did
a
great
job

but
if
you
build
computer
systems
like
well
you
know
what
does
that
computer
program
really
do
you
know
or
especially
if
you
write
like
papers
you
know
or
do
design
studies
or
something

it
's
real
hard
to
rate
something
like
that

it
's
like
get
a
painter
you
know
or
something
a
artist

it
's
like
well
you
how
do
you
really
rate
you
know
michelangelo
you
know

how
would
you
tell
if
he
was
you
know
really
good
or
so-so
or
whatever

an
interesting
topic

uh-huh

ah

boy
you
and
my
husband
would
have
a
whole
lot
in
common

uh-huh

oh
really

what
's
the

how
old
is
your
car

oh

yeah

right

oh

yeah

so
what
do
the
miatas
run

well
that
's
not
too
bad

yeah

really

i
've
never
driven
one

huh

uh-huh

and
so
you
've
done
this

oh

okay

oh

really

yeah

whatever
my
husband
buys

oh
not
too
much

no

we
uh
we
just
got
rid
of
a
full
conversion
van
that
that
i
i
i-
that
was
n't
me

that
was
my
husband

he
wanted
a
van

and
he
wanted
to
drive
that
van
and
travel
and
wanted
everything
in
there
t
v
you
know
the
whole
bit

but
i
never
drove
it

so
it
just
it
was
n't
me
you
know

and
then
oh
i
'd
want
a
minivan

because
i
'm
with
the
kids
all
the
time

yeah

yeah

and

yeah

you
pick
up
i
pick
up
my
little
one
from
preschool

and
the
whole
parking
lot
's
full
of
minivans

but
you
know
i
i
drive
a
little
subaru

and
uh
we
i
love
that

i

we
were
going
to
trade
that
in
for
the
van

but
i
just
wanted
to
hold
on
to
it
cause
i
just
really
enjoy
that

and
uh
that
's
really
all
i
needed
was
for
something
just
to
go
here
and
there
and
back

uh-huh

oh
really

oh
really

yeah

yeah

it
's
amazing
what
a
minivan
can
do

we
went
camping
this
past
weekend
with
some
friends
that
had
a
minivan
and
pulled
the
uh
the
little
trailer
behind

the
pop-up
trailer

and
uh
it
's

so
it
's
really
amazing
how
much
a
minivan
c-
you
know
what
it
can
do

no

they
're
not

they
're
probably

yeah

yeah

and
we
we
do
a
lot
of
uh
driving

we
do
a
lot
of
traveling
by
car

and
so
that
's
the
only
time
that
the
that
the
uh
conversion
van
came
in
handy

but
it
really
did
n't
cause
our
our
kids
are
still
little

so
uh
that
was
the
only
time
we
really
needed
it

other
than
that
it
got
terrible
mileage

and

yeah

yeah

yeah

yes

the
uh
type
of
cars
that
i
was
uh
i
would
be
most
interested
in
if
i
was
going
to
buy
another
car
now
would
probably
be
something
like
a
uh
mazda
miata

uh
the
uh

i
'm
very
much
a
a
fan
of
sports
cars

the

the
uh

uh
uh
though
actually
in
som-

actually
if
i
h-

i
have
av-

i
've
avoided
buying
a
new
car
for
quite
some
time

i
'd
rather
put
my
money
into
uh
restoring
my
old
cars

i
have
a
old
triumph
t
r
six

and
uh
uh
so
uh

but
if
i
was
to
buy
one
probably
something
like
a
miata

it
's
certainly

i-

i
would
n't
have
to
worry
about
it
breaking
down
all
the
time

yeah

uh
well
i
have
a
i
have
a
nineteen
eighty
uh
eighty-five
c
r
x

uh
which
is
you
know
it
's

it
still
works
fine

but
it
's
it
's
actually
it
's
kind
of
annoying
cause
i
've
got
no
reason
to
replace
it

but
uh
oh
those
are

they
're
about
uh
uh
thirteen
to
fourteen
thousand
dollars
and
you
know
a
bit
more
if
you
add
some
some
options
and
so
on

but
the

uh
yeah

that
's
a
pretty
good
price

and
they
're
they
're
they
're
they
're
so
nice
to
drive

uh
uh
it
's
it
's
it
's
nice

they
're

i
've
been
down
to
a
dealer
and
driven
them

and
i
've
also
driven
one
at
a
something
mazda
put
on
where
uh
they
went
to
uh
autocross
events
across
the
country
uh
which
is
where
you
race
in
uh
you
race
on
in
a
parking
lot
or
something
like
that
with
a
bunch
of
uh
cones
to
see
who
can
get
through
the
fastest

uh
you
know
about
a
minute
or
so
and
uh
very
twisty
stuff

and
oh
it
handles
so
nicely

yeah

yeah

it
was
just

it
it
's
just
so
smooth

and

yeah

nice
car

what
are
you
interested
in

yeah

you
you
do
n't
get
involved
in
uh
car
decisions

yeah

i
can
understand

well
would
you
want
if
you
had
to
decide
what
would
you
want
okay

yeah

they
're
nice

oh
yeah

that
's
perfect
for
that

it
's
not

it
it
's
small
enough
that
it
's
easy
to
drive

holds
a
lot

yeah

yeah

right

yeah

minivans
are
nice

i
have
a
friend
who
has
a
minivan

and
uh
i
've
driven
it
a
few
times

and
uh
i-
it
's
nice

it
's
nice

of
course
you
know
my
fam-
my
family
has
always
had
cars
like
that
uh
in
that
you
know
my
father
's
had
a
had
a
always
had
a
v
w
bus
every
since
uh
nine
about
nineteen
sixty
or
so

uh
uh

they
well

he
he
used
it

he
often
has
to
transport
plants
or
uh
things
like
that
cause
he
's
he
goes
to
orchid
shows
and
and
you
know
fills
the
car
with
plants
and
so
on

or

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

and
they
're
not
that
expensive

yeah

mainly
because
everyone
makes
them
you
know

you
can
take
your
choice
of
how
expensive
you
want
it
to
be

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

minivans
d-
do
pretty
well
you
know
twenty
twenty
twenty-five
miles
per
gallon
or
more

some
of
them
probably
even
do
thirty

the
uh

yeah

there
there
's
some
other
cars
i
'd
like

but
i
u-
u-
i
would
never
be
willing
to
send
quite
that
much
money
for
uh
like
uh
uh

i
'll
drool
over
them

uh-huh

and

in
what
way
are
you
talking
about

right

yeah

right

see
i

yeah

and
i
also
thought
that
uh
that
would
interfere
with
with
college
work

and
they
did
n't

yeah

yeah

that
's
true
yeah

when
do
they
assume
this
is
going
to
be
proposed
or
mandatory

or
when

when

what
what
year
are
they
looking
at

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

right

right

yeah

i
thought
that
was
your
line

uh
what
age
group
i-
are
are
they
looking
at

eighteen

yeah

that
seems

normally
that
would
interfere
with
college
i
would
think

i
moved

maybe
that
is
that
's
part
of
it

oh

oh
um

right

uh-huh

yeah

well
that
's
kind
of
scary

i
'm
not
near
that
age

i
'm
way
over
it

but
i
do
have
children
to
think
about
you
know

that
's
kind
of
scary

right

yeah

oh

uh-huh

huh

i
do
too

he
's
he
's
helped
out
in
a
lot
of
ways

yeah

he
's
he
's
from
dallas

or
he
's
in
the
dallas
area

and
uh
he
's
very
well
known
around
here

so

uh-huh

yeah

i
i

yeah

yeah

i
i
think
he
's
got
a
very
good
chance

so
there
's
a
lot
of
people
here
pulling
for
him

so
i
do
n't
know

we
'll
just
see

how

did
you
uh
you
work
in
the
uh
computer
business
is
that
what
you
said

oh
okay

uh
my
husband
works
for
uh
texas
instruments

and
so
uh
that
's
how
we
found
out
about
the
switchboard

okay

uh
mandatory
service
yeah
i
do
n't
think
it
's
a
good
idea
uh

because
we
'd
have
to
change
the
constitution
to
to
uh
allow
uh
involuntary
servitude
uh
in
service
to
the
government

and
i
'm
not
sure
that
we
could
do
that
in
such
a
way
that
we
could
avoid
winding
up
a
slave
state

it
's

i
like
the
idea

well
i
like
the
idea
of
volunteer
voluntary
support

i
mean
they
might
be
able
to
ah
say
that
anyone
who
does
that
uh
gets
certain
benefits
that
would
not
be
available
to
someone
who
did
n't
do
it

but
to
use
force
uh
really
sets
us
a
a
i-
i-
essentially
says
that
your
body
there
's
a
title
to
your
body
and
that
title
belongs
to
the
government

and
you
are
not
a
free
american
citizen

the
idea
itself
of
service
is
good

and
when
someone
is
say
out
of
high
school
and
not
sure
about
college
or
out
of
college
and
not
ready
to
go
into
a
career
and
they
're
not
committed
to
huge
amounts
of
debt
that
's
the
best
time
to
be
able
to
do
work
that
does
n't
pay
very
well

yeah

unless
it
were
tied
directly

you
know
if
someone
were
studying
something
take
something
obscure
somebody
was
studying
economics
the
state
department
could
offer
to
send
them
to
the
soviet
union
for
two
years
to
teach
them
how
to
run
their
country

as
an
extreme
example
right

but
in
reality
i
think
what
you
would
wind
up
with
is
a
political
football
where
they
would
see
all
these
body
counts
that
they
can
use
to
for
their
own
will

and
i
just
do
n't
think
it
would
work

well
they
're
not

it
's
been
suggested

and
it
's
sort
of
a
topic
of
debate

every
time
it
comes
up
it
gets
voted
down

the
people
who
are
promilitary
oppose
because
they
do
n't
want
people
to
have
the
right
to
opt
out
of
the
military
into
something
else

and
the
people
who
are
proconstitution
oppose
it
on
the
grounds
that
the
government
should
n't
even
have
the
right
to
enforce
you
to
join
the
military
unless
the
united
states
is
actually
under
attack

so
mostly
it
's
just
kind
of
one
of
those
things
that
goes
away

ah
they
've
got
a
noisy
line

yeah

well
it
's
somewhere
between
here
and
there

uh
oh
eighteen

the
draft
age

yeah

wait
a

yeah

let
me
see
if
i
can
get
on
a
cleaner
line

if
it
's
my
line
uh

yeah

it
is
my
line

i
was
on
a
radio
phone

all
right

that
's
better

yeah

now
their

they
they
figure
that
they
can
draft
you
at
eighteen

they
usually
do
draft
you
at
nineteen

and
that
's
the
age
they
're
looking
at

and
of
course
they
're
this
one
the
women
would
be
equally
grabbed

and
they
're
almost
on
the
verge
of
saying
that
you
if
you
're
going
to
draft
men
you
're
going
to
have
to
draft
women

and
you
're
going
to
have
to
put
them
in
front
of
the
guns
just
the
same

so
uh
if
you
're
near
that
age
or
you
know
somebody
who
is
uh
you
know
be
aware
of
that

yeah

oh
okay

yep

and
you
do
n't
want
them
sent
off
to
the
middle
east
to
help
defend
bush
from
saddam
after
bush
gets
done
arming
him

you
know
we
only
find
out
about
that
a
year
after
the
fact

so
it
's
another
thing

when
in
doubt
do
n't
trust
the
government
at
all

it
's
really
reached
that
point

hey
you
're
in
perot
country

i
'm
really
thinking
that
this
guy
might
be
good
for
us

i
've
been
i-

it
seemed
dangerous

i
thought
is
the
guy
a
closet
fascist

and
then
i
find
out
that
he
helped
rid
the
united
states
of
the
gablers

yeah

okay

well
i
'm
in
the
computer
biz
too

so
i
know
he
's
well
known
in
the
industry

they
uh

i
i
have
high
hopes
for
him

and
i
think
that
you
know
if
he
could
get
people
interested
and
encouraged
and
to
believe
that
the
government
was
actually
for
us
then
i
'm
for
him

i
mean
in
the
democratic
primary
i
'm
going
to
vote
for
brown
just
because
i
kind
of
like
brown
and
his
attitude

but
when
uh
when
it
really
comes
down
in
the
fall
i
think
i
know
where
it
's
going
to
go

uh-huh

yeah

you
know
th-

yeah

i
'm
an
end
user

i
teach
people
how
to
use
macintoshes
and
how
to
buy
equipment
and
desktop
publishing
magazine
production
and
things
related
to
that

uh-huh

oh
yeah

oh
that
's
their
project
too
is
n't
it

i
found
about
it
on
the
network

okay

yeah

is
it

i
know
in
here
uh
downtown
dallas
it
's
you
i
mean
you
drive
by
and
you
can
just
you
can
see
it

but
then
again
i
originally
was
from
california

and
uh
there
is
a
big
difference
between
texas
and
california

and
uh
they
'd
have
their
smog
alerts
and
where
you
'd
have
to
stay
indoors
for
so
many
hours
with
an
air
conditioner

and
of
course
they
do
n't
have
that
here
in
texas

so
there
's

no

not
in
not
in
te-
well
not
in
dallas
that
is

yeah

we
're
going
there
tomorrow

uh-huh

we
're
packing
and
getting
ready
to
go
to

uh-huh

yeah

oh
okay

yeah

you
do
then

is
it
really

i
would
not
imagine
that

huh

huh

you
learn
something
every
day

uh-huh

yeah

i
've
seen
that

huh

huh-uh

huh

no

oh
yeah

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

that
's
true

right

huh

and
of
course
i
doubt
if
there
's
any

you
can
buy
regular
anymore

you
buy
unleaded

right

yeah

huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

that
is
good

yeah

yeah

huh

oh

that
would
be
nice

i
think
i
saw
that
on
t
v
one
time

they

maybe
it
was
c
n
n
where
they
were
demonstrating
that
or
something
similar
to
that

huh

but
what

w-

w-

i
think
that
was
a
a
a
setback

that
they

i
do
n't
know

they
went
i
do
n't
know
how
many
miles
an
hour

i
think
like
twen-

was
that
something
maybe
it
was

i
do
n't
know

huh
huh

yeah

and
they
're
they
're
very
expensive
too

well
yeah

yeah

well
it
does
n't
make
sense

because
if
they
want
people
to
convert
you
know
they
should
make
it
worthwhile

yeah

yeah

um
well
i
'll
tell
you
sometimes
it
's
it
's
pretty
bad
here

like
today
i
think
it
was
pretty
bad

i
do
n't
know
if
it
was
if
it
's
just
uh
the
allergies
or
what

but
some
days
it
's
r-
very
nice
here
downtown

and
other
days
it
's
just
really
bad

so
i
do
n't
know

so
what
what
kinds
of
things
did
you
experience
in
l
a
when
you
were
there

or
can
you
remember

were
you
there
at
a

cause
i
have
n't
been
there
probably

yeah

well
we
were
there
when
they
had
a

okay
carol

so
air
quality

uh-huh

surely

you
mean
they
do
n't
have
the
uh
the
smog
alerts

right

i
i
yeah
i
spent
a
summer
i-
i-
in
tyler
so
i
know
just
east
of
dallas
there

oh
really

yeah

actually
i
'm
a
california
born
person

i
was
born
in
l
a

so
i
know
what
you
're
talking
about

in
l
a
it
's
pretty
bad

uh
the
worst
city
in
the
in
the
world
is
actually
uh
mexico
city

yes

the
worst
one
for
smog
is
mexico
city

the
most
polluted
city
in
the
world

yeah

i
know
that
they
've
they
're
looking
at
uh
uh
you
know
uh
you
know
better
running
automobiles

uh
some
things
they
do
w-
w-
one
of
them
is
they
're
using
corn
in
fuel

you
ever
heard
of
that

yeah

methanol

yeah

well
that
's
big
up
here
because
of
the
they
grow
a
lot
of
corn

uh
that
's
one
thing
that
they
do

at
that
it
's
pretty
easy
to
do

and
the
uh

unfortunately
it
still
contributes
to
global
warming
cause
you
have
to
you
know
wipe
out
forests
to
grow
corn
and
things
like
that

it
does
n't
make
sense

uh
but
it
's
you
know

one
of
the
most
uh
productive
crop
in
the
world
is
corn

yeah

drive
cars
with
catalytic
converters
and
all
that

it
's
interesting

they
're
they
're
looking
at

there
's
some
work
being
done
on
uh
automobiles
that
are
electrical
powered

and
uh
they
're
looking
at
where
you
have
a
battery
operated
car
basically

but
it
has
a
a
engine
in
the
back
that
charges
it

so
the
engine
kicks
on
when
the
batteries
need
power

and
it
turns
off

interesting
thing
about
gas
is
when
i
mean
about
battery
powered
cars
is
when
you
're
at
a
stop
light
you
're
not
using
any
any
energy

unlike
a
car
where
it
's
running

a
electric
car
it
's
on
demand

i
mean
it
's
either
on
or
off

basically

you
do
n't
have
to
shift

so
you

cars
become
very
simple
all
of
a
sudden
too

very
interesting

yeah

there
's
there
's
a
race
in
australia
with
solar
powered
cars

and
ford
and
general
motors
and
all
those
compete

right

yeah

g
m
uh
chrysler
announced
that
they
're
going
to
they
're

well
they
actually
have
an
electric
minivan

yeah

their
their
caravan

but
it
costs
uh
fifty
thousand
dollars
right
now

to
operate
yeah

but
you
know
people
are
buying
them

you
know
whose
buying
them

the
power
company

free
you
know
free
for
them

kind
of
interesting
so
see

uh-huh

yeah

it
's
top
speed
is
something
like
eighty
miles
an
hour

so
it
's
a
good
good
vehicle

uh-huh

oh
i
was
n't
there
too
long
ago
uh

well
you
know
yo-
going
over
the
hills
you
know
coming
into
the
valley

you
can
see
that
horrible
horrible
brown
haze

i
'm
ready

well
in
atlanta
georgia
you
probably
have
a
lot
more
crime
than
we
have
here
in
patterson
california

uh
this
little
city
is
only
about
eight
thousand
people

so

well
in
patterson
there
's

it
's
not
a
problem
here

but
like
uh
i
lived
in
oakland
uh
until
just
recently

and
uh
oakland
california
god
they
've
had
like
uh
sixty-seven
murders
so
far
this
year
compared
to
like
uh
forty
at
this
time
last
year

so
it
's
really
bad
there

and
and
it
's
all
related
to
drugs
it
seems
like

is
that
what
it
's
there
too

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

like
i
do
n't
know
what
they
can
do
to
make
it
better
unless
they
just
hire
more
policemen

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

well
i
i
think
that
if
they
would
do
something
to
these
people
that
they
do
catch
instead
of
just
slapping
their
little
hands

and
you
know
then
maybe
those
other
people
would
be
kind
of
scared

and
they
would
not
do
these
bad
things
you
know

yeah

i
just
do
n't
understand
our
our
laws
here

because
you
know
like
in
other
countries
man
i
mean
they
're
really
a
lot
stricter
than
we
are

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh
uh

yeah

yeah

i
know
when
i
lived
in
oakland
it
was
just
that
uh
like
i
definitely
would
n't
go
into
certain
areas
of
of
the
city
by
myself

and
uh
and
then
then
again
some
areas
i
would
n't
go
by
myself
after
dark
you
know

but
down
here
in
patterson
well
like
i
say
it
's
so
small
that
you
can
go
anywhere

but
just
uh
like
twenty
miles
away
see
in
modesto
they
have
uh
those
gangs
and
things
over
there

and
it
it
's
bad

in
sacramento
also
they
have
uh
drive
by
shootings
it
seems
like
all
the
time

so
i
do
n't
know

i
just
i
just
do
n't
know
what
what
they
can
do
you
know

i
know

yeah

i
mean
like
even
even
going
to
the
grocery
store

i
know
we
've
had
this
one
lady
that
was
attacked
you
know

i
mean
just
you
just
you
just
do
n't
know
what
to
do
anymore
you
know

and
some
of
the
times
it
's
happening
in
the
daytime
too
you
know

so
it
's
not
always
happening
at
dark

so
i
do
n't
know

oh
could
could
be

huh

yeah

we

is
is
crime
a
problem
there

like
a
major
problem
minor
problem
or

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

oh
yeah

yeah

i
've
only
been
here
for
like
uh

probably
just
over
six
months
i
start
i
started
school
here

uh
i
came
from
a
smaller
town
in
in
new
york

and
cri-
the
city
was
fairly
big
size
or
not
real
big

but
we
had
a
problem
there

but
here
there
's
just
no
comparison
that
much
more
crime

uh
every
night
the
news
is
very
depressing
because
it
just
they
run
down
the
list
of
how
many
people
were
shot
you
know
drive
by
shootings
or
whatever

and
it
's
it
it
's
pretty
bad

they
're
they
're

it
's

things
have
basically
improved
here
over
the
last
few
years

they
've
they
've
actually
taken
steps
to
try
to
make
it
better

but
it
still
it
still
is
a
problem

well
that
's
that
seems
to
be
what
they
were
doing

and
it
has
and
they
've
started
stepped
up
more
patrols
in
certain
areas

and
it
has
has
made
some
places
safer

but
you
know
it
's
very
difficult

i
mean
if
you
do
n't
have
an
infinite
amount
of
money
to
to
try
to
stop
the
problem
although
most
people
wish
you
could
as
it
is
a
it
's
definitely
a
problem

and
you
know
the
more
more
less
that
's
done
about
it
the
more
it
seems
it
tends
to
spread
into
smaller
areas
unfortunately

right

yeah

i
think
i
think
that
uh
it
's
uh
seems
to
be
that
i
do
n't
know
some
people
they
te-
they
do
something
you
know

they
shoot
somebody
or
whatever

they
go
to
jail

sentenced
to
jail
for
like
thirty
years
they
're
out
in
five

and
they
're
back
on
the
street

and
then
they
shoot
someone
else

and
just
a
a
cycle

and
it
seems
seems
as
though
the
the
system
does
n't
cha-
tend
to
stop
them
unless
something
is
drastic
is
done

yeah

it
's
definitely
true

it
seems
seems
as
though
we
try
to
play
humanitarian
i
think
to
a
little
to
much

and
maybe
some
of
the
people
do
n't
deserve
the
the
humanitarian
treatment
that
they
get

but
i
do
n't
know

it
's
a
difficult
situation
i
think

and
some
something
has
to
be
done
because
i
definitely
think
it
's
it
it
really
plays
reeks
havoc
with
your
quality
of
life
when
you
know
you
can
see
it
's
going
on
around
you

but
then
when
once
it
finally
affects
you
then
then
it
really
starts
to
bother
you

but
it
seems
i
mean

people
have
moved
like
out
of
the
city
because
they
want
to
get
away
from
the
crime

and
so
they
tend
to
spread
the
cities
farther
and
farther
out

but
you
know
it
's
only
a
matter
of
time
before
you
know
it
still
catches
up
with
them

you
ca
n't
really
run
away
from
the
problem

and
something
you
know
something
has
to
be
done
but
just
that
too
many
people
argue
about
how
to
fix
it

oh
sure

right

right

yeah

yeah

that
's
good

right

yeah

yeah

yeah

it
's
it
's
to
bad
because
it
's
uh
i
mean
th-
just
even
the
random
occurrences
where
you
know
it
's
unsafe
for
a
woman
just
to
walk
from
the
car
to
the
some
in
certain
areas
like
from
the
car
from
their
car
to
the
mall
or
something

and
it
's
dangerous

and
it
's
just
that
's
just
ridiculous

and
you
know
it
's
just
that
's
just
not
right

something
you
know

right

right

right

yeah

yeah

it
's
definitely
unfortunate

okay

uh
let
me
see

i
've
been
sitting
here
awhile

i
almost
forgot
the
topic

but
uh
it
seems
like
i
get
most
of
my
news
from
television

i
'm
we
only
get
the
paper
on
the
weekends

and
so
i
'm
not
much
of
a
of
a
paper
reader

or
but
i
i
and
i
'm
do
n't
rarely
listen
to
the
uh
radio

so
i
get
most
of
my
news
like
from
documentaries
like
forty-eight
hours
twenty
twenty
you
know
the
news
at
night
news
in
the
afternoon
that
kind
of
thing

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

are
you
in
the
car
quite
a
bit

or

oh

oh

uh-huh

oh
i
see
uh

yeah

i
i
i
pretty
much
am

and
i
watch
the
news
at
least
twice
a
day

so
uh
if
i
've
missed
something
and
and
i
've
just
recently
decided
to
stay
home
with
my
children

and
so
it
seems
as
if
i
catch
the
news
ris-
right
as
it
happens
you
know

there
was
the
explosions
and
that
kind
of
thing

my
husband
will
say
how
did
you
know
about
that

yes

it
happened
at
such
and
such
time

and
that
's
so
that
that
's
different
for
me

so
i
usually
find
out
exactly
when
it
happens
and
that
kind
of
thing

uh
no

it
just
seems
like
since
i
've
recently
stayed
home
that
is
what
's
happened
you
know

it
's
just
that
uh
now
that
i
've
stayed
home
i
'm
i
'm
usually
aware
of
when
these
things
occurred

and
it
happened

and

right

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

right

right

it
kind
of
gives
you
the
whole
story
or
more
of
the
story

that
kind
of
thing

so
uh

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

i
know
what
you
're
saying

yeah

but
i
try
and
catch
most
of
those
programs
on
wednesday
's
and
friday
's

and
if
i
miss
them
i
try
you
know
i
try
and
and
tape
them
if
i
'm
out
that
kind
of
thing

i
try
and
tape
them

and
so
i
can
sit
back
and
watch
them

and
it
's
pretty
interesting

uh-huh

well
yeah

plus
i
find
that
i
have
to
video
tape
quite
a
bit
of
things

if
i
do
n't
want
any
interruptions
you
know

that
kind
of
thing

uh
it
seems
like
ten
o'clock
at
night

unfortunately

but
that
that
's
what
it
seems
like
ten
o'clock
at
night

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
i
get
a
weekend
paper
as
well

and
uh
in
addition
to
that
i
get
a
local
weekly

i
i
live
in
suburb
of
milwaukee

and
they
get
they
have
community
newspapers
around
here
so
the
local
their
extremely
local
stuff
uh
is
in
the
local
paper
that
comes
out
once
a
week

and
then
i
get
the
sunday
uh
milwaukee
journal
because
i
do
n't
have
time
to
read
a
paper

uh
mostly
that
's
my
difficulty

i
uh
i
get
my
news
pretty
much
from
the
same
sources
as
you
do
although
i
do
listen
to
n
p
r
which
has
very
good
and
that
's
national
public
radio
which
has
very
good
uh
coverage
of
the
national
and
international
news
i
feel
and
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
analysis
as
well

no

i
'm
not
actually
uh

but
i
can
run
my
radio
in
my
office

i
i
teach
at
the
university

and
when
i
'm
not
teaching
if
i
choose
to
have
the
radio
on
i
can
listen
to
that
station

so

how
are
you
are
you
satisfied
with
the
twenty
twenty
and
forty-eight
hours
and
the
things
that
you
do
watch

uh-huh

uh-huh

is
that
the
aspect
of
the
news
that
you
're
most
interested
in
is
is
the
timely
yo-
noting
of
the
events
as
they
happen

is
that
what
you
feel
good
about
in
the
news
coverage

uh-huh

well
i
myself
uh
th-
the
reason
why
i
listen
to
n
p
r
and
the
reason
why
i
watch
macneil
lehrer
rather
than
the
than
the
network
news
shows
at
night
although
i
do
o-
watch
a
local
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
news
which
carries
over
a
lot
of
the
national
news
stories
uh
is
that
quite
often
it
seems
to
me
the
national
does
n't
do
a
very
good
job
of
analysis

the
local
does
n't
either

but
i
feel
that
macneil
lehrer
get
a
little
more
deeply
into
some
some
of
the
issues
that
are
really
current

and
perhaps
newspapers
do
that

but
as
i
said
i
do
n't
have
time
to
sit
down
and
read
a
newspaper

and
frankly
when
i
have
read
a
newspaper
i
have
n't
noticed
that
kind
of
analysis
either

so
uh
there
's
there
is
some
danger
to
that
of
course
too

because
if
the
analysis
is
inaccurate
or
biased
or
whatever
then
you
know
how
good
is
it

but
uh
i
like
a
little
more
indepth
coverage

and
i
think
that
's
what
you
're
maybe
appealing
to
you
too
on
something
like
twenty
twenty
or
forty-eight
hours

uh-huh

yeah

i
'm
more
interested
in
trying
to
understand
what
's
going
on
in
the
world
rather
than
simply
being
aware
that
you
know
there
that
an
event
has
occurred

i
i
like
to
stand
back
and
get
a
slightly
bigger
picture

maybe
because
i
'm
easily
confused
by
detail

i
do
n't
know

so

when

you
have
young
children
right

so
those
evening
shows
are
probably
also
at
a
time
when
you
're
at
liberty
to
take
some
time
off
and
be
in
front
of
the
t
v
set
for
awhile
without
interruption

oh
you
do

uh-huh

uh-huh

when
is
your
good
watching
time

uh-huh

yes

yeah

that
's
what

i
have
older
children
and
getting
dinner
on
the
table

i
come
from
the
east
coast

and
i
was

it
amazed
me
when
i
got
out
here
to
the
midwest
and
found
out
that
even
though
they
're
an
hour
earlier
in
time
they
still
watch
the
news
when

uh
in
texas
they
do
have
the
uh
capital
punishment

and
uh
i
i
ju-
i
i
'm
probably
one
that
has
to
agree
with
it
too

uh
there
a-

some
things
that
go
on
that
i
just
feel
that
i
i
just
feel
that
that
that
is
a
need

i
do
n't
know

a
lot
of
people
do
n't
feel
that
way
either

but
i
just
feel
that

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

that
is
a
consequence

yeah

right

right

uh-huh

well
maybe
that
's
something
that
needs
to
be
worked
on

but
i
i
just
feel
that
that
capital
punishment
needs
to
stay
within
the
system

not
all
states
have
them

but
i
you
know
was
that
was
that
the
i
'm
not
sure
if
that
was
in

was
that
the
man
that
that
claimed
he
was
abused

or

and
that
he
had

he

oh
yeah

yeah

yeah

and
how
long
had
he
been
a-
appealing

how
long
was
that

gosh

boy

yeah

boy
well
i
mean

and
it
seems
like
it
it
rarely
does
happen

you
know
it
's
not
it
's
not
used
that
often
you
know
at
least
here
in
texas

but
i
think
it
's
something
that
needs
to
stay

i
really
do

yeah

right

right

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

my
sister
and
i
were
wondering
about
this
recently
because
a
an
old
friend
of
ours
in
california
this
happened
about
a
week
ago

uh
her
husband
just
killed
her

and
we
're
wondering
if
that
has
an
effect

if
that
if
something
does
capital
punishment
you
know
does
it
happen
with
that
within
that
uh

i
do
n't
know

right

i
think
you
're
right

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

and
uh
i
have
an
uncle
that
is
an
attorney
that
defends
people

well
i
do
n't
know
how
much
publicity
it
's
gotten
outside
of
the
state

but
california
we
just
put
somebody
to
death
uh
for
i
think
it
was
a
double
murder

uh
to
be
honest
i
did
n't
pay
that
much
attention
uh
to
the
details
of
it
uh

but
it
had
a
lot
of
controversy
out
here

uh
basically
because
in
california
people
like
to
protest
about
everything

uh
but
i
agree

i
believe
that
that
there
are
a
number
of
crimes
that
capital
punishment
is
the
best
way
to
go

uh
the
big
disagreement
i
have
is
that
in
california
the
appeals
process
uh
is
so
extensive
and
takes
so
long
that
you
end
up
spending
a
huge
amount
of
money
in
like
ten
to
fifteen
years
before
you
can
actually
you
know
put
somebody
to
death
for
for
a
crime

and
i
mean
that
's
that
's
ridiculous

i
mean
if
you
can
you
know
y-
y-
the
trial
is
supposed
to
prove
you
know
within
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
person
is
guilty

and
then
they
have
appeals

well
that
's
fine

but
it
should
n't
take
more
than
a
few
years

i
mean
i
should
think
two
or
three
years
maximum
you
should
be
able
to
know

and
you
should
be
able
to
either
put
the
guy
to
death

or
he
's
innocent

i
mean
it
's
if
he
's
guilty
for
for
you
know
multiple
murders
or
whatever
the
case
may
be
you
know

yeah

yeah

he
was
like
uh

the
the
defense
the
defense
they
're
were
giving
given
was
that
uh
like
his
mother
had
had
been
an
alcoholic
when
when
she
was
pregnant
with
him

and
so
he
he
was
n't
you
know
mentally
competent
or
anything
else
which
is
ridiculous

and
and
the
court
found
him
competent
uh

and
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
everything
else

i
mean
you
know
it
was
it
was
the
best
defense
they
could
come
up
with

i
forget

i
think
it
was
something
like
twelve
years
or
something

it
was
it
was
something
really
outrageous

yeah

i
think
in
general
uh
punishment
in
the
united
states
is
a
lot
weaker
than
it
should
be

i
mean
it
needs
to
be
you
know

it
's
kind
of
like
the
the
justice
system
in
the
united
states
is
kind
of
like
the
dog
poops
on
the
carpet

and
you
wait
three
months

and
then
you
put
his
nose
in
it
and
spank
him
for
it
you
know

i
mean
there
there
's
no
connection
between
the
two

i
mean
you
take
these
you
know
most
of
the
people
who
are
committing
violent
crimes
most
of
them
not
all
by
any
means

but
you
know
a
large
percentage
are
the
kind
of
people
who
are
living
very
much
day
to
day
in
the
first
place

uh
they
do
n't
really
see
past
next
week
much
less
next
year

and
to
say
you
know
well
if
i
kill
somebody
then
a
decade
from
now
i
might
face
the
punishment

that
's
not
real

it
does
n't
have
any
real
impact
on
them

uh-huh

uh
you
mean
would
he
be
put
to
death
for
that

uh
largely
depends
on
the
circumstances

and
generally
you
know
from
what
i
understand
it
's
it
's
only
the
most
brutal
types
of
things
usually

where
it
's
multiple
you
know

if
if
they
can
say
things
like
you
know
well
he
was
just
you
know
temporarily
insane
because
of
some
domestic
squabble
then
you
know
they
'll
they
'll
give
him
you
know
twenty
years
with
with
parole
in
in
twelve
or
something
like
that

well
i
'm

are
you
there

okay

i
'm
sure
that
i
probably
uh
prescribe
to
different
magazines
ones
that
you
do

i
take
doll
reader
and
doll
world
because
i
collect
dolls

uh
i
also
take
better
homes
and
gardens

i
like
that

and
then
uh
my
husband
he
just
uh
subscribed
to
a
wood

he
just
started
a
woodwork

so
he
just
sent
away
to
get
some
woodworking
books

so
what
kind
do
you
uh
get

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

is
it

yeah

i
used
to
take
that

right

yeah

yeah

i
do
n't

i

if
i
you
know
if
i
happen
to
find
it
i
'll
go
ahead
and
read
it
someplace
you
know
if
i
'm
in
a
doctor
's
office
or
something
like
that

but
other
than
that
i
never
i
never
liked
that
really

i
read
my
newspaper

i
can
hardly
wait
in
the
mornings
for
the
newspaper
to
get
here
you
know

so
i
do
like
to
read
the
newspaper
uh
even
this
little
newspaper
that
patterson
puts
out

in
fact
it
puts
it
out
on
tuesdays
and
thursdays
i
can
hardly
wait
to
get
that
to
get
the
local
news

but
uh
other
than
that
magazines
i
do
n't
know
there
's
so
much
advertising
in
them
anymore

oh
okay
uh-huh

huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

right

right

yeah

well
i
i
only
you
know
subscribe
to
the
things
i
'm
interested
in

i
used
to
be
into
coin
collecting

so
i
used
to
get
the
coin
magazine
the
paper
actually
is
what
it
was
you
know

i
used
to
get
that

so
now
that
i
'm
into
dolls
that
's
about
all
i
really
really
want
you
know

no

huh-uh

uh
i
think
they
're
interesting

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
those
travel
magazines
are
that
more
or
less
show
you
different
countries
that
you
could
go
to

or

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

okay

well
i
do
n't
know
any
other
magazines
i
could
talk
to
you
about

uh
i
do
n't
take
anymore
than
that

you
know
so

well
i
guess
that
will
be
it
then

and

yes

yes

different
set

uh-huh

oh

well
i
have
a
bunch
of
computer
journals
because
i
'm
in
computer
science

but
beyond
that
uh
lately
i
've
been
reading

i
've
always
liked
the
new
yorker

and
lately
i
've
been
picking
up
some
of
the
travel
uh
both
trade
magazines
and
just
the
general
travel
magazines
uh
trying
to
keep
up
on
what
's
going
on

my
wife
also
gets
a
lot
of
the
food
magazines
bon
appetite
and
food
and
wine
and
gourmet

yeah

and
she
still
likes
to
get
time
which
i
've
never
liked
very
much

but
she
seems
to

do
you
read
a
newspaper

yeah

some
of
them
i
used
to
get
for
the
advertising
like
byte
magazine
which
is
uh
one
of
the
larger
computer
ones

i
have
n't
bought
it
now
for
about
eight
years

but
when
i
used
to
get
it
it
was
about
five
hundred
pages
about
three
hundred
of
them
advertising

because
that
was
interesting
i
think
a
lot
of
the
trade
magazines
are
like
that

that
that
half
the
fun
is
finding
out
what
all
the
products
are

but
you
know
some
of
the
get
ridiculous

travel
and
leisure
all
of
the
american
express
magazines

so
travel
and
leisure
food
and
wine
and
i
think
they
have
some
others
uh
certainly
half
the
pages
and
maybe
more
are
pure
ads
plus
they
have
the
advertising
supplement
sections
that
are
supposed
to
look
like
articles
but
are
paid
for

and
it
is
it
's
clear
that
i
i
've
bought
some
of
these
through
wholesalers

and
they
do
n't
care
if
they
make
any
money
on
the
magazine
subscription
they
're
making
everything
on
ads

uh-huh

have
you
ever
uh
read
or
subscribe
to
consumer
reports
for
any
length
of
time

but
not
worth
it

i
i
've
always
had
this

one
of
the
reasons
i
like
just
to
pick
up
magazines
in
other
fields
is
that
you
seem
to
get
a
very
different
perspective

so
i
've
always
had
this
problem
with
consumer
reports
that
in
the
areas
that
i
know
a
lot
about
i
disagree
with
them

and
i
always
wonder
whether
there
are
people
who
know
a
lot
about
every
area
disagreeing
with
them
on
everything
or
or
what
's
going
on

so
i
like
i
've
picked
up
now
a
subscription
to
one
of
the
travel
agent
uh
organization
magazines

and
it
's
a
ridiculous
difference
when
you
start
reading
from
their
perspective

uh
you
know
their
major
interest
is
in
commissions

and
you
know
there
's
very
little
talk
about
the
quality
of
places
or
airlines

their
major
talk
is
about
you
know
commissions
and
commission
rebates
and
how
they
wo
n't
suggest
hotels
to
people
if
the
commission
's
not
a
the
full
ten
percent
or
whatever
it
is

and
it
gives
you
a
different
perspective
on
what
people
do

uh
some
of
them

the
the
general
travel
magazines
do

i
do
n't
tend
to
read
it
for
that
because
i
do
n't
expect
to
be
traveling
overseas
in
in
the
future
for
quite
awhile

but
i
i
usually
just
read
through
the
sections
on
on
domestic
stuff

no

yeah

i
do
n't
take
much
more
in
myself

okay

okay

nice
talking
to
you

been
on
the
line
for
awhile

i
almost
forgot
what
the
topic
was

uh
but
i
know
what
it
is

uh
let
me
see

i
i
i
i
i
'm
kind
of

i
do
n't

you
know
i
'm
i
'm
kind
of
in
the
middle

i
i
think
it
's
a
great
idea

but
when
it
comes
to
me
it
's
like
almost
an
insult
you
know

so
it
's

i
i
've
come
from
the
teaching
field

so
so
it
's
just
like
i
do
n't
know
i
i
guess
i
guess
i
'd
have
to
go
with
uh

i
i
i
'd
be
for
it
you
know

but
uh
you
know
i
i
i
do
n't
know
it
's
just
kind
of
a
kind
of
a
delicate
subject
i
guess

but
i
i
i
would
i
would
probably
go
for
for
going
ahead
and
doing
it
you
know
if
it
's
got
to
be
done
for
everyone

right

right

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

you
kind
of
goes
into
your
privacy

and
you
know
but
i
guess
if
they

you
know
you
know
there
's
uh

i
guess
there
's
some
companies
that
are
n't
that
are
doing
it

and
it
it
seems
to
be
working
out

so

yeah

right

see
that
's
hard

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

then
i
kind
of
hear
it
goes
into
like
uh

this
is
just
something
i
've
heard
that
it
kind
of
goes
into
like
uh
just
your
off
the
counter
medication
that
you
could
be
taking
for
a
cold
that
it
kind
of
affects
that
too

oh
i
did
n't
know
that

um

yeah

see
things
like
that

so

yeah

right

right

uh-huh

see
that
's

yeah

that
's
where
i
kind
of
get
into

cause
it
kind
of
gets
into
your
personal
life
you
know

and
wha-
what
's
kind
of
next

the
what

huh

oh

yeah

right

yeah

right

so
do
you
think
they
'll
kind
of
push
into
the
teaching
field
eventually

i
kind
of
think
they
will

yeah

yeah

we
have
n't
either

yeah

but
i
i
i
just
kind
of
think
it
's
heading
that
way
though
you
know
it
's
just
because
it
's
just
hitting
to
close
to
home
with
the
kids
and
stuff

and
i
just
i
just
kind
of
think
it
's
going
to
eventually
head
that
way

yeah

right

right

yeah

okay

uh
based

oh
okay

good

uh-huh

right

so
do
i

uh-huh

right

i
think
if
it
's
got
to
be
done
for
one
person
in
the
company
it
should
be
random
testing
it
should
be
for
everybody

you
know
when
they
answer
the
company
i
think
it
'll
make
it
a
lot
easier

and
they
'd
run
into
less
problems
because
uh

i
do
n't
know
i
come
from
the
teaching
field
too

and
it
sort
of
uh

it
's
a
pro
and
a
con
ty-

i
do
n't
know
where
to
stand
on
it

i
'm
more
or
less
if
they
told
me
i
had
to
well
then
fine

but
if
you
know
if
they
made
me
then
i
'd
probably

if
i
had
my
druthers
i
'd
probably
say
well
no

you
know
just
this

right

uh-huh

yeah

i
think
it
's
it
's
what
they
're
basically
trying
to
do
i
do
n't
know
up
here
in
massachusetts
anyhow
what
they
're
basically
trying
to
do
is
uh
oh
gosh
uh
any
people
who
had
di-
tested
positively
getting
them
into
a
drug
program
or
rehab
program

and
uh
anybody
who
uh
gee
is
you
know
di-
does
n't
accept
the
rehab
program
then
they
're
more
or
less
getting
laid
off

i
i
think
that
's
really
hard
to
because
you
know
you
never
know
i
do
n't
know
it

that
's
a

it
's
really
weird
issue

i
'm
sort
of
on
the
fence
about
it

but
i

you
know
that
that
's
what
's
they
're
coming
across
as
is
some
of
the
companies
anyhow

oh
we
can
get
you
into
a
drug
program

but
then
you
wear
that
stigma
you
know

where
uh
like
a
lot
of
people
are
saying
well
i
only
smoked
a
joint
last
night
i
do
n't
have
any
problems
you
know
or
something
like
that

yeah

right

anything
with
an-
a

you
know
if
you
drink
a
lot
of
caffeine
or

yeah

somebody
was
saying
telling
me
if
you
drink
it
in
you
know
an
awful
lot
of
caffeine
that
that
can
show
up
as
a
positive
test

i
know
i
'm
an
epileptic

so
i
'd
probably
test
positive
and
and
then
i
'd
have
a
heck
of
a
time
explaining
what
drug
is
in
my
system
you
know

and
a
lot
of
times
those
are
the
things
i
do
n't
like
to
disclose
to
an
employer
because
then
they
do
n't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you

you
know
it
's
very
personal

i
would
n't
want
to
have
it
disclosed
because
then
i
'd
always
wonder
if
they
fired
me
you
know
why
did
you
fire
me

uh-huh

yeah

it
it
hits
me
as
the
orwell
thing
big
brother
is
watching

orwell

and
you
know
his
book
brig
big
brother
is
watching

you
know
you
're
being
controlled
that
type
of
deal

and
i
sh-

i
do
n't
really
you
know
i
do
n't
know
seems
awful
strange

i
'd
hate
to
have
to

if
i
had
my
choice
between
a
company
that
did
testing
and
a
company
who
did
n't
i
'd
probably
take
the
company
who
did
n't
because
i
feel
there
'd
be
more
trust
in
the
employee

but
i
can
understand
why
they
need
it
with
all
the
you
know
train
accidents
and
everything
else

i
think
they
will
too
because
uh
you
know
it
's
just
going
to
follow

i
do
n't
know
i
we
have
n't
had
any
of
it
in
our
school
system

so
uh
you
know
hopefully
we
wo
n't

right

well
and
eventually
it
's
going
to
be
not
only
the
tea-

you
know
the
kids
are
going
to
be
under
scrutiny
it
's
going
to
be
the
teachers

and
if
they
can
test
the
teachers
that
gives
them
the
full
right
to
test
the
kids

and
then
they
you
know
caught
everybody

okay

uh
i
have
n't
been
in
this
situation
yet

you
know
my
my
parents
are
not
quite
at
that
age
yet

so
i
have
n't

no

so
i
have
n't
uh
really
been
in
that
situation
although
they
are
thinking
about
my
grandmother

but
uh
but
that
's
really
about
it

how
about
you

have
you
been
in
that
situation
yet

uh-huh

did
it
really

yeah

oh
no

that
's
sad

yeah

oh
okay

i
'm
sure
they
were

yeah

uh-huh

ah

yeah

oh

um

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

and
i
'm
sure
it
's
it
's
expensive

yeah

yeah

yeah

my
my
grandmother
is
not
in
a
nursing
home

but
she
's
in
a

oh
they
're
like
uh
they
're
apartments
for
senior
citizens

and
she
loves
that
because
they
arrange
activities
for
them
all
day
long

and
then
they
have
uh
where
the
bus
picks
them
up
and
takes
them
where
they
need
to
go

and
she
she
she
really
does
love
that

but
she
's
just
concerned
about
i-
in
the
future
you
know
that
she
she
knows
it
's
not
going
to
be
like
that
all
the
time

and
she
's
just
wondering
well
what
's
going
to
happen
to
me

and
and
i

you
know
it
's
i
guess
it
's
so
normal
to
start
to
wonder
about
that
even
if
she
does
n't
need
that

but
you
know

she
's
kind
of
asking
questions
about
what
well
what
's
going
to
happen
this
ca
n't
last
forever

and
so

yeah

yeah

she
can

but
i
i
think
it
is
also
cafeteria
style
because
i
i
really
i
i
i
doubt
if
she
rarely
cooks
for
herself
so
uh

because
i
i
remember
her
in
her
letters
telling
me
she
'll
go
downstairs
for
coffee
or
something
to
eat

so
i
'm
assuming
it
's
something
like
that
too

so

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

and
she
lives
by
herself
too

she
seems
to
like
it

and
uh
my
husband
's
grandmother
is

well
she
lives
she
lives
in
a
house
on
her
own

and
she
does
n't
really
need
the
care
or
anything
like
that

but
she
has
her
own
home

and
sh-
she
's
doing
really
well

i
'm
really
proud
of
her

she
's
doing
really
well

so
we
have
n't
had
to
do
anything

but
then
again
she
has
a
lot
of
support

so
i
mean
she
's
got
her
mother
in
town
too
and
things
like
that

so
hopefully
we
wo
n't
need
to
go
that
route

yeah

they
're
not
quite
elderly
huh

uh-huh

uh
not
for
my
parents

but
i
i
was
around
uh
two
sets
of
grandparents
uh
quite
a
bit

we
we
put
one
i
put
one
grandfather
in
a
rest
home

and
that
killed
him

well
yeah

kind
of

well
there
was
some
other
things
involved

but
it

before
he
was
really
active

and
the

there
was
some

you
know
he
lost
his
drivers
license

and
i
could
n't
get
around
and
was
n't
able
to
do
some
things

and
so
we
ended
up
just
having
to
put
him
in
a
rest
home

and
he
just
kind
of
became
a
vegetable
and
died

so
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago

that
was
uh
back
in
like
seventy-three

so
uh
i
think
the
way
they
did
things
were
a
lot
different
back
then

and
uh
my
grandmother
his
his
wife
uh
we
also
put
her
in
a
rest
home

she
was
in
a
rest
home

and
then
she
was
back
out
because
she
did
n't
really
need
to
be
there
and
uh
had
a
physical
had
a
good
physical
therapist
at
that
place

and
they
worked
with
her
and
got
her
walking
and
got
her
ta-
kind
of
taking
care
of
herself

and
so
she
was
able
to
come
back
home

and
then
she
had
to
go
back
in
a
couple
of
times

but
mostly
it
was
just
because
she
kind
of
gave
up

and
they
got
her
going
again

so
i
guess
as
far
as
looking

i
said
as
what
you
're
looking
for
i
think
you
need
to
look
for
an
active
uh
an
interactive
staff
somebody
who
is
willing
to
work
with
uh
you
know
work
with
a
patients
and
do
do
things
with
them
and
treat
them
treat
like
they
're

it
it
is

it
is
expensive

uh-huh

oh
uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

when
she
ca
n't
take
care
of
herself

uh-huh

now

uh-huh

does
she
have
a

is
it
like
a
kitchenette
type
apartment
where
she
can
fix
her
own
food
if
she
wants
to

or
she
can
go
down
to
the
cafeteria

uh-huh

in
fact
i

uh-huh

yeah

i
i
really
like
that
concept

they
've
they
have
a
few
of
those
well
quite
a
few
of
those
places
like
that
here
in
utah

and
you
know
couples
can

you
know
husband
and
wife
can
can
live
there
too
or
or
whatever

i

and
and
then
and
yet
they
have
their
their
friendships
and
relationships
and
the
you
know
of
getting
together
and
eating
together
and
all
of
that

i
i
think
it
really
takes
uh
you
know
looking
more
at
the
people
than
even
really
the
facilities

uh-huh

yeah

yes

well
i
i
think
that
that
's
the
thing
that
's
a
little
bit
scary
you
know
a
little
bit
tough
about
putting
them
in
a
rest
home
is
it
's
it
's
almost
like

that
you
know
they
say
putting
them
out
to
pasture

and
some
some
of
the
people
that
were
there
with
my
grandmother
were
really
active

they
they
wanted
to
do
things

they
did
n't
you
know
they
did
n't
want
to
go
down
and
play
bingo
or
uh
you
know
play
with
the
oranges

i
imagine
you
ca
n't
escape
it

well
of
course
it
was
fun
for
you

to

oh
really

i
was
born
and
raised
in
uh
near
miami
and
uh
spent
the
last
twenty
years
in
dallas
uh
where
the
rangers
played

and
uh
for
the
last
uh
what
year
roughly
year
i
've
been
in
san
francisco
where
there
are
two
teams
the
oakland
a
-s
and
the
san
francisco
giants

uh
but
honestly
you
know
i
uh
i
do
my
duty
and
watch
the
sports
on
uh
the
newscasts

but
that
's
about
all
the
exposure
i
have
to
sports

uh-huh

oh
yeah

sure

well
i
guess
the
uh
san
francisco
giants
and
the
oakland
a
-s
were
like
the
leading
teams
a
couple
of
years
ago

well
i
th-

well
i
do
n't
know

that
's
sort
of
what
i
gather

um
and
uh
i
do
n't
know

what
is
the
prognosis
for
uh
this
year

good

i
i
assume
that
means
good
for
the
minnesota

yep

i
think
a
train
went
by

i
know
a
train
went
by

i
do
n't
know
what
the
noise
was

but
i
think
it
probably
was
the
the
train

well
i
do
n't
know

i
i
i
do
n't
even
know
uh
who
has
been
winning
in
uh
as
far
as
the
uh
san
francisco
giants
and
the
oakland
a
-s

but
i
think
they
both
won
their
opener

i
uh
sort
of
gathered
that
in
my
uh
subliminal
memory

huh

uh-huh

i
guess
they
are
different
leagues

is
that
right

the
a
-s

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

eighty-six

huh

well
they
must
play
every
day
then

i
mean
eighty-six
times
two
is
a
hundred
sixty

and
that
's
lord
that
's
uh
over
five
months
worth

even
if
they
play
every
day
that
's
over
five
months
worth

no

that
was
the
super
bowl

i
do
n't
feel
so
bad

i
think
you
you
do
n't
know
all
that
much
more
than
i
do
about
baseball

i
see

okay

oh
really

okay

well
i
i
know
uh
the
super
bowl

actually
i
'm
in

like
i
said
i
'm
in
minneapolis

and
the
big
thing
up
here
of
course
is
the
twins
uh

no

it
's
it
's
pretty
pervasive

it
kind
of
goes
into
about
all
aspects
of
society
i
think
up
here

but
uh
actually
i
do
n't
know
how
much
of
the
world
series
you
caught
last
year

but
that
was
a
lot
of
fun

well
to
be
honest
with
you
i
'm
not
from
minneapolis

in
fact
i
've
only
been
up
here
a
few
months

and
i
'm
going
back
at
the
end
of
next
month

uh
orlando
florida

so
i
'm
not
exactly
a
real
twins
fan
from
birth
or
anything

but

oh
yeah

oh

uh-huh

right

oh
okay

yeah

i
have
n't
followed
it
real
closely
at
all
uh
except
like
i
said
last
year
when
the
world
series
rolled
around
i
did
i
did
follow
that
pretty
religiously

went
out
into
the
bars
you
know
drank
a
beer
watched
the
game
had
a
gir-
a
good
time
that
way

but
uh

is
that
right

uh-huh

uh
real
good
as
far
as
i
can
tell

people
are
pretty
excited
about
it

well
yeah

sorry
about
that

yeah

uh
as
far
as
the
twins
are
concerned
it
seems
to
be
real
good

uh
my
roommate
went
and
saw
them
play
on
their
season
opener
a
couple
of
nights
ago

and
they
they
won
that
one
seven
to
one

so
uh
that
's
pretty
good
i
guess

it
looks
like
they
'll
be
doing
pretty
well

are
you
still
there

okay

i
heard
some
noise
on
the
line

did
n't
know
what
happened

oh
okay

all
right

yeah

uh-huh

well
maybe
that
has
has
good
tidings
for
their
uh
for
their
season
coming
up

i
've
actually
got
a
friend
that
's
living
in
san
francisco
right
now

uh
he
's
doing
the
same
thing
i
'm
doing
which
is
basically
uh
an
internship

we
we
're
both
doctoral
students

and
he
's
doing
his
with
i
b
m

and
i
'm
doing
mine
with
honeywell

but
uh
i
i
think
he
kind
of
follows
the
sports

and
i
think
he
's
mentioned
uh
the
oakland
a
-s
a
couple
of
times

uh
he
may
have
watched
them
and
seemed
to
think
that
they
were
pretty
good

as
far
as
i
know

yeah

and
in
the
major
leagues
i
guess
there
is
a
couple
of
different
divisions

and
then
of
course
there
's
the
minors

uh
i
do
n't
know

i
i
guess
i
'm
one
of
those
people
that
if
i
really
made
a
concentrated
effort
i
could
really
probably
get
into
baseball

uh
but
i
was
talking
to
my
roommate
a
couple
of
nights
ago
right
after
that
game

and
he
offered
you
know
to
take
me
to
one
of
the
games
because
apparently
he
'd
bought
uh
he
and
four
other
people
from
honeywell
had
bought
a
seat
or
a
row
of
seats
actually
for
the
home
games

but
the
thing
is
there
's
like
eighty-six
home
games
per
year

so
there
's
no
no
way
that
you
can
ever
use
them
all

eighty-six

i
was
amazed
to
hear
that

you
know
that
's
just
the
home
games

and
i
i
thought
it
was
a
mistake

but
he
goes
no

yeah

well
just
about

yeah

yeah

and
that
's
you
know

yeah

that
's
almost

that
's
a
lot
of
baseball

well
you
yo-
if
you
if
you
consider
it
the
season
starts

well
it
's

the
season
started
about
a
week
and
a
half
ago

and
it
ends
with
the
world
series
which
usually
takes
place
i
believe
in
december
or
january

yeah

i
think
so

it
did
last
we-
year
did
n't
it

or
was
it
november

maybe
it
was
november
i
'm
thinking
about

i
know
it
was
doggone
cold
up
here
uh

well
i
know
for
sure
it
was

i
know
it
was
after
september
because
that
's
when
i
got
up
here

and
and
it
was
at
least
two
months
after
i
got
up
here

yeah

so
it
had
to
be
november
anyway

okay

what
would
you
rather
have

or
you
want
salary
too
plus
what

what
's
most
important
to
you

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

well
i
'll
tell
you

i
think
that
is
the
most
important
thing

i
've
uh
i
'm
not
working
right
at
the
moment

but
the
company
that
i
did
work
for

excuse
me
i
had
health
benefits
you
know
dental
vision
all
that
pension
plan
uh

now
i
do
n't
have
that
although
i
do
have
a
pension
that
i
'm
drawing
from
them
which
thank
god
i
had

but
uh
man
i
think
those
medical
benefits
are
the
most
important
uh

right

uh
i
should
knock
on
wood

i
have
n't
you
know
had
any
serious
health
problems
or
anything

i
've
only
probably
been
to
the
doctor
a
couple
of
times
since
i
left
work

and
it
was
only
for
a
cold
you
know

and
they
ca
n't
really
do
anything
for
you
anyhow

so
you
might
as
well
not
even
go

yeah

right

oh
you
've
got
a
cold

go
home
and
take
uh
liquids
and
uh
rest

but

uh
that
is
definitely
the
most
important

uh
pension
i
guess
is
next

uh
thank
god
that
i
had
one

i
do
n't
know
what
happened
to
the
salary
employees
when
uh
the
company
went
bankrupt

but
i
was
union

so
mine
was
being
put
into
a
like
a
trust
fund
you
know

so
but
i
do
n't
know
if
they
ever
got
anything
or
if
they
lost
all
of
theirs

or

yeah

that
's
what
i
was
thinking
too

i
really
feel
sorry
for
all
those
people
that
spent
all
that
time
there
you
know

so
where

what
company
do
you
work
for

um
uh-huh

no

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

no

i
i
worked
for
a
trucking
company
p
i
e
nation
wide

you
probably
heard
of
that

oh
does
she
really

oh
how
about
that

well
you
did

well
ryder
and
p
i
e
went
together
you
know

and
then
then
that
ended
it

it
really
did

it
's
it
started
i
think
a
little
bit
before
that

but
that

when
p
i
e
and
and
ryder
went
together
why
that
was
downhill
from
then
on
you
know

right

right

yes

it
was
over
three
hundred
fifty
dollars
a
month
if
we
wanted
to
continue
our
own
benefits

we
could
do
that
for
eighteen
months

but
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
month

god
that
's
terrible
you
know

so
but
anyhow
uh
and
jobs
are
n't
that
hard
to
find
to
get
another
one
that
does
pay
your
benefits
you
know

and
a
lot
of
them
that

if
you
do
get
a
job
they
do
n't
pay
benefits

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

right

but
you
know
what
's
happening
is
the
disability
plan
you
know

so
many
people
are
lying
about
their
things

god
there
's
been
big
articles
in
the
paper
about
that

uh
you
know
they
claim
a
back
injury

and
then
someone
goes
out
and
spies
on
them

and
they
're
lifting
refrigerators
into
trucks
and
and
everything
else
you
know

so
i
do
n't
know
what
's
happening
and
what
's
going
to
happen

but
uh

well
as
far
as
tangible
benefits
go
i
would
say
that
uh
health
insurance
of
all
forms
is
probably
my
next
most
important
concern

i
feel
that
a
company
that
can
provide
good
health
benefits
such
as
health
care
dental
and
vision
as
well
as
good
long-term
and
short-term
disability
plans
uh
goes
a
long
way
toward
satisfying
my
needs

right

you
you
really
do
n't
realize
how
important
they
are
until
you
find
yourself
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
without
them
and
having
to
cover
your
own
medical

and
uh
you
can
quickly
see
where
they
become
a
very
important
part
of
your
your
compensation
package

yeah

they
look
at
you
say
well
you
're
still
breathing
so
uh
yeah

right

i
suspect
that
it
just
disappeared

right

uh
i
work
for
a
little
start-up
company
here
in
pittsburgh
called
trans
ark
uh

have
you
heard
of
them

they

we
do
uh
distributive
system
software
for
unix
based
workstations

so

ah
yes

yes

in
fact
my
mom
drives
trucks

so

yes

so
yeah

i
see
uh

after
the
merger
uh
you
see
a
lot
of
ryder
pie
stuff
on
the
road

so
did
did
ryder
get
out
of
the
business

is
that
what
happened
or

right

huh

so
that
the
merger
pretty
much
ended
the
whole
thing

yeah

and
the
the
problem
with
that
is
you
know
when
you
leave
a
job
you
can
continue
your
benefits
for
some
finite
period
of
time

but
when
when
the
company
goes
bankrupt
i
mean
the
they
're
just
cut
off
completely

and
you
're
responsible
for
your
own

and
and
that
's
exceedingly
expensive

right

it
's
definitely
excessive

true

yeah

they
're
starting
to
to
cut
back
especially
start-ups

i
know
here
at
trans
ark
we
get
uh
we
get
health
care

and
that
's
it

i
mean
there
's
no
dental
or
vision

and
the
the
short-term
disability
policy
is
is
a
ninety
day
policy

and
there
is
no
long-term
disability
policy

so
you
know
at
least
in
the
case
of
this
particular
company
they
tend
to
scrimp
a
little
bit
there

and
you
know
of
course
they
can
use
the
excuse

well
we
're
start-up

right

well
that
certainly
does
n't
help
matters
any

i
mean
you
you
get
people
who
are
willing
to
put
their
neck
on
the
line
to
get
you
you
know
these
additional
benefits

you
want
to
go
first

really

well
yeah

i
do
a
lot
of
exercise

right
now
i
'm
into
jazzercise
which
i
absolutely
love

uh
i
started
about
two
years
ago
because
i
gained
some
weight
over
the
past
few
years

and
i
wanted
to
get
it
back
off

and
i
was
going
through
a
divorce

and
i
just
found
that
running
really
made
me
feel
good

got
out
a
lot
of
aggression

i
went
to
the
gym
every
day

and
i
ran
on
the
treadmill
and
rode
the
bike

and
uh
i
felt
really
good

i
needed
to
do
it

and
it
was
really
helpful
at
the
time

now
when
i
do
those
things
they
're
boring

i
would
rather
be
outside
then
in
the
gym
doing
this
in
one
place

and
so
i
just
recently
discovered
jazzercise
about
two
months
ago

and
i
'm
getting
to
be
a
good
dancer
from
it

and
i
'm
just
feeling
really
good

i
love
the
class

it
's
real
challenging

so
i
'm
really
into
that

i
really
like
that
a
lot

it
is
it
's
aerobics

but
it
's
with
dance
steps

it
's
an
aerobic
exercise

and
it
's
an
hour
straight

and
it
's
just
uh
it
's
a
lot
of
fun

i
feel
like
i
'm
not
just
exercising
because
i
'm
dancing

and
i
'm
i
'm
getting
much
better

my
stamina
is
getting
great
for
the
dance
floor

so
i
mean
it
's
just

there
's
a
lot
of
positive
things
with
it

so

it
is
inside

and
i
've
been
doing
a
lot
of
bike
riding
outside
with
the
nice
weather
we
've
been
having

and
i
just
enjoy
that
much
more
too
than
inside

i
have
a
thirteen
year
old
daughter

and
so
we
go
bike
riding

and
it
's
nice

we
get
to
spend
some
time
together
rather
than
i
go
to
the
gym
while
she
does
her
homework

so
i
've
enjoyed
that
part
of
it

yeah

and
at
the
gym
even
in
the
class
uh
i
w-
e-

it
's
not
really
a
group
where
you
chat
a
lot

everybody
's
on
their
way
to
someplace

and
so
you
know
i
do
have
one
friend
who
goes
occasionally

but
basically
i
do
it
by
myself
in
a
group
of
maybe
forty

so

there
are
there
are

it
's
more
motivating
that
way
i
think

yeah

you
could
get
a
tape
probably
and
do
it
at
home
in
front
of
the
t
v

but
i-

you
probably
would
n't

so

yeah

yeah

yeah

i
can
see
it
'll
be
a
good
break

right

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

i
think
you
do

you
feel
very
good
after
you
exercise

i
think
it
's
worth
making
the
time
for
yourself

you
owe
it
to
yourself

and
i
think
you
do
accomplish
more
after
that

and
i
think
that
it
's
just
is
good
for
your
self-esteem
for
everything
because
when
you
look
better
you
feel
better

and
it
's
just
uh

i
think
it
's
well
worth
it

i
just
demand
that
time
for
myself

now
i
've
learned
to
do
that

and
you
know
and
it
's
i
think
it
just
benefits
you
all
around

so

you
have
to

because
there
's
always
more
things
to
do

there
is
always
things
that
you
can
make
priority
to
it

but
i
just
i
do
n't
demand
a
lot
for
myself

and
so
you
know
i
just
feel
entitled
to
it

and
i
take
it

so

no

i
've
done
some
walking
with
friends
in
the
past

but
i
find
that
when
you
do
that
you
do
more
chatting
than
you
do
exercise

and
that
's
not
really
beneficial

so
uh
i
do
n't
have
time
like
that

and
i
spend
enough
time
chatting
around
everywhere
you
know

well
uh
no

i
don-
i
do
n't
get
as
much
exercise
as
i
as
i
should
as
or
as
i
would
like
to
uh
uh
these
days

i

seems
to
be
to
easy
to
get
busy
with
other
things

uh
i
have
in
the
past
uh
jogged
and
and
run

and
every
every
january
and
every
september
i
start
out
again

and
then
it
tapers
off

uh
what
about
you

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

well
now
that
is
that
uh
that
's
related
to
the
the
aerobic
uh

okay

yeah

yeah

yeah

well
uh
okay

now
that
's
inside
again

right

but

do
do
you
like
to
do
it
wi-
with
other
people

i
mean
like
the
the
jazzercise
would
be

yeah

yeah

right

but

yeah

right

right

but
still
there
are
there
are
other
people
there
doing
the
doing
the
same
thing

in
terms
of
motivation
and
incentive

yeah

yeah

yeah

uh
that
makes
a
difference
does
n't
it

i
i
've

one
thing

when
when
i
have
run
and
jogged
uh

i
've
always
enjoyed
doing
it
by
myself

and
and
kno-

not
with
the
sense
that
it
was
uh
uh
chore
or
something
that
i
was
having
to
do

i
i
've
really
enjoyed
just
the
activity

and
uh
i
write
software
uh
as
far
as
the
job

and
so
getting
out
and
being
active
uh
is
uh
uh
helps
out

the
th-

it
's

the
ch-
the
chan-
the
change
of
pace
and
just
getting
out
and
around

and
i
find
that
i
can
often
you
know

often
uh
when
i
get
around
to
doing
it
then
i
i
feel
better
when
i
get
back
to
work

and
uh
uh
also
that
that
it
my
subconscious
is
working
on
things
while
i
'm
working

and
i
i
go
back

and
i
've
got
new
ideas

but
still

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

yeah

i
think
that
's
uh
i
think
that
's
a
good
term
d-
demanding
the
time
for
yourself

that
you
've
just
got
to
you
've
just
got
to
prior-

right

yeah

well
good

well
good

well
uh
uh
have
you
have
you
done
any
jogging

i
tell
you
you
said
you
did
on
the
bike
and
on
the
treadmill
in
in
the
uh
club

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

yeah

okay

uh
read
any
good
books
lately

oh
okay

uh-huh

uh
well
i
'm
in
graduate
school

and
so
i
read
a
lot
of
books

but
i
do
n't
know
if
i
consider
very
many
of
them
good

uh
i
have
n't
read
a
book
for
enjoyment
since
i
guess
around
christmas

uh
i
re-
received
uh
uh
several
books
for
christmas

and
at
christmas
break
i
read
uh
sarum
by
uh
uh
a
fellow
named
rutherford

uh
it
's
the
history
of
uh

well
it
's
sort
of
the
his-
the
historical
fiction
about
uh
the
salisbury
area
in
in
england

and
so
i
i
really
enjoyed
that
book
a
lot

uh
he
's
not
quite
as
good
as
you
know
michener
or
some
of
uh
some
of
the
other
historical
writers

but
he
he
did
this
job
well

so

yeah

uh
do
you
find
th-
do
you
find
you
have
much
chance
to
read
for
for
just
pleasure
or
mostly
for
business

uh-huh

i
do
n't
think
i
have
seen
it

uh-huh

uh-huh

oh

okay

i
think
i
have
heard
about
that

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

that
sounds
great

did
did
it
have
something
to
mention
about
uh
sort
of
uh
cultural
rituals
of
of
manhood

okay

yeah

i
have
heard
of
that

i
have
uh
someone
suggested
that
i
read
it

is
it
iron
john

okay

good

b
l
y

okay

great

uh-huh

uh
what
are
your
favorite
uh

do
you
have
a
favorite
subject
to
read
whether
it
be
science
fiction
or
or
history

or

uh-huh

uh-huh

okay

uh-huh

okay

uh-huh

that
sounds
great

uh
who
is
your
whose
your
favorite
religious
author

uh-huh

uh-huh

max
lucado

yeah

yeah

uh
he
's
a
great
man

i
've
met
him
several
times
uh

huh

uh
uh-huh

uh
yes

i
i
've
read
uh
several
good
books
lately

uh
lot
of
them
related
to
uh
business
and
financial
matters
since
that
's
what
i
do
for
a
living

how
about
yourself

yes

uh-huh

well
that
sounds
good

no

i
read
for
pleasure
some
also

i
read
a
book
recently
called
iron
john

have
you
seen
that
by
bly

okay

well
it
's
a
book
about
uh
uh
greek
gods
and
and
greek
uh
mythology
as
well
as
uh
man
and
interacting
with
other
men
and
a
book
about
uh
men
and
how
they
mature
through
life

and
how
they
deal
with
life
itself

but
it
's
uh
it
's
all
revolved
around
uh
mythology
uh
as
far
as
uh
traditions
from
uh
other
cultures
and
our
culture
and
how
we
uh
interact
with
one
another

yes

yes

by
bly

b
l
y
i
believe
it
is

uh-huh

and
uh
it
's
a
very
interesting
book

well
it
depends
again
if
we
're
talking
about
uh

i
read
a
lot
of
religious
books
uh
just
because
i
have
an
interest
in
that
area

and
i
read
a
lot
of
books
in
the
area
of
uh
uh
psychology
and
self-help
type
uh
materials

uh
always
trying
to
understand
people
better
and
understand
myself
in
relation
to
other
people
and
try
to
understand
where
the
people
are
coming
from
because
i
'm
in
a
people
business

and
uh
so
that
that
's

my
work
is
my
hobby

so
i
i
enjoy
it

well
i
do
n't
know
if
i
have
a
favorite
uh
religious
author

i
would
have
to
say
that
uh
some
of
the
ones
that
consistently
put
out
good
materials
uh
you
know

that
that
's
difficult
because
one
person
might
write
one
book
extremely
well
and
some
other
ones
might
not
write
as
well

uh
i
had
to
stop
here
and
think
a
second

one
of
the
ones
that
i
've
read
recently
that
i
've
read
several
of
his
books

and
i
thought
that
each
one
of
his
books
were
good

he
's
the
man
out
of
san
antonio

and
uh

max
lucado

max
consistently
writes
good
books

yes

i
know
him

yeah

but
uh
there
's
other
authors
also
that
have
uh
uh
that
write
good
books
from
time
to
time
but
not
consistently
put
out
the
materials
all
the
time

uh
i
'd
say
another
which
is
a
local
writer
here
in
plano
uh
is
uh

i
'm
trying
to
think
of
his
name

he
's
with
the
bible
church

and
that
is
uh

i
see
his
name

but
i
ca
n't

i
mean
i
see
him

but
i
ca
n't
see
his
name

but
he
uh
he
talks
about
uh
he
talks
about
a
lot
of
different
topics

and

uh
i
basically
uh
listen
to
the
news
from
the
t
v

that
's
probably
the
only
time
i
get
a
chance
to
uh
uh
take
a
look
at
it
is
the
evening
news

and
and
then
if
i
'm
lucky
i
might
be
able
to
hear
something
through
news
wise

but
uh
other
than
that
that
's
probably
how
i
get
my
source
unless
something
really
tragic
happens
and
somebody
tells
me
it
about
through
uh
uh
you
know
uh
through
conversation
or
whatever

but
uh
most
of
the
time
it
is
through
the
news
in
the
evening

so
that
's
about
the

newspapers

no

i
'm
not
too
much
in
reading
newspapers

uh
not
that
i
do
n't
enjoy
newspapers
or
anything
like
that

but
uh
part
of
it
is
because
i
just
do
n't
feel
like
i
need
the
need
to
have
them
uh
with
watching
the
t
v
or
whatever

we
get
our
weekly
news
around
the
area

and
i
might
look
through
it
real
quick
if
there
's
something
that
catches
my
interest
uh
in
regards
to
what
's
going
on
around
the
county
or
little
bit
of
the
state

but
the
majority
of
the
time
now
i
do
n't
get
a
daily
newspaper
where
you
know
i
get
tons
of
uh
news
coming
in
that
kind
of
stuff

oh
you
do

you
read
it
in
the
morning
then

uh-huh

sure

oh
sure

to
see
if
they
did
it
or
if
they
uh
criticize
you
or
put
something
in
there
wrong

sure

sure

uh-huh

sure

sure

exactly

uh-huh

sure

well
that
's
that
's
kind
of
like
you
said
then

we
we
are
kind
of
on
the
opposite
where
i
get
home
and
uh
while
i
'm
cooking
supper
the
t
v
is
on
and
watching
the
news
or
trying
to
catch
up
with
what
is
going
on

and
uh
very
seldom
do
i
catch
the
ten
o'clock

so
by
that
time
you
know
old
news
is
probably
what
i
hear
through
the
grapevine
or
whatever

but
uh
unless
there
is
a
big
issue
going
on
like
when
we
were
at
war
then
i
think
everybody
was
glued
to
the
t
v
to
find
out
what
was
going
on

but
uh
other
than
that
no

it
's

exactly

exactly

exactly

sure

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

well
it
brought
kind
of
uh
more
of
a
vivid
uh
look
at
what
was
going
on
when
they
were
dropping
the
bombs
and
just
a
lot
of
different
things

but
uh
yeah

that
's
true

you
know
you
know
a
lot
of
people
that
read
the
news
to
newspapers
to
get
the
news
of
what
's
going
on

and
uh
other
people
that
you
know
do
it
differently
or
do
n't
even
watch
any
news
at
all

so
but

exactly
happens

sure

sure

that
's

oh
sure

a
clip
you
know
a
sentence
or
two

and
that
's
about
it
of
what
went
on

and
uh
they
have
so
much
other
information
to
cover
in
such
a
short
period
of
time

sure

makes
sense

yeah

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

so
you
're
right
on
the
coast
line

you
're
not
uh
further
up

you
're

uh-huh

sure

sure

i
suppose
you
watch
for
huri-
hurricanes
coming
in
and
things
like
that

sure

yeah

that
's
about
the
only
time
in
the
in
the
summer
uh
if
you
're
watching
t
v
for
the
weather
even
though
it
's
very
hard
to
predict
what
's
going
on

they
'll
kind
of
say
well
there
's
a
thunderstorm
warning
or
whatever

this
is
the
what
is
expected

but
a
lot
of
times
things
happen
and
change
here
so
drastically
uh
so
fast
you
know
where
movement
that
was
coming
in
has
shifted
or
whatever

so

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

to
take
off

sure

yeah

that
's

sounds
pretty
good

so
anyway
i
do
n't
know
if
our
time
is
getting
up
here

or
it
's
got
to
be
fairly
close
to
that

you
do
n't
get
any
newspapers

i
'm
kind
of
the
opposite
of
you

i
get
all
my
news
from
newspapers

we
have
we
have
two
newspapers

yeah

two
newspapers
in
the
morning

and
uh
i
'm
uh
in
in
a
government
position
that
i
'm
in
the
news
a
lot

so
uh
i
i
kind
of
look
through
to
see
see
what
uh
i
'm
quoted
in

but
uh
how
how
bad
the
quotes
are
every
day

yeah

or
uh
sometimes
there
's
uh
letter
to
the
editor
about
me

or
there
's
a
even
uh
editorials
for
and
against
what
i
'm
doing

but
uh
but
t
v
uh
the
t
v
i
i
do
n't
really
watch
even
if
i
'm
even
if
i
'm
on
it

but
just

right

and
that
's

c
n
n
had
the
uh

everybody
was
watching
c
n
n

that
seemed
to
be
the
place
to
be
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
on
that

at
that
point
i
was
watching
the
t
v
on
something
like
that

well
the
thing
is
with
with
t
v
i
i
uh

a
lot
of
times
the
the
news
on
uh
the
local
t
v
is
so
brief
you
really
do
n't
get
the
full
picture
of
what
uh
what
's
going
on

and
uh
that
's
that
's
a
problem
that
i
have
is
not
getting
just
a
little
brief
uh
idea
of
what
's
happening

but

right

but
i
like
the
weather
report

so
i
wa-

i
alway
always
i
always
turn
that
on

that
's
one
part
i
watch
because
of
uh
i
go
surfing
down
here

and
i
always
want
to
watch
the
weather
for
when
the
waves
are
going
to
be
good

yeah

no

right
on
the
south
florida
coast
where
the
weather
is
still
warm
here

yeah

yeah

weather
channel
's
good

yeah

i
mostly
look
for
the
storms
out
in
the
ocean
uh
hundreds
of
miles
out

so
i
can
predict
my
my
week
and
where
i
'm
going
to
be

so
i
can
be
at
the
at
the
beach
when
the
waves
start
coming
in

okay

well
i
can
see
it
in
certain
cases
where
it
might
be
uh
somebody
's
in
a
position
that
uh
perhaps
a
lot
of
lives
are
involved
like
maybe
uh
pilots
that
uh
you
know
fly
jets

and
uh
maybe
people
that
have
a
lot
of
responsibility
over
a
large
mass
of
people

i
could
certainly
see
it
being
done

but
in
general
uh
you
know

whether
companies
want
to
do
this

and
i
know
that
companies
do

like
factory
workers
that
have
lots
of
accidents
are
now
being
drug
tested

i
know
a
couple
of
corporations
that
are
doing
that

uh
so
you
know
they
kind
of
have
gotten
into
the
idea
that
let
's
drug
test
them
and
let
's
put
them
through
rehab

but
there
's
got
to
be
like
a
limitation

do
we
drug
test
everybody
that
comes
in

and
or
do
we
kind
of
say
well
you
can
be
drug
tested

and
you
look
okay
because
you
look
this
way

you
're
you
're
very
conservative

and
and
there
's
just
no
way
that
we
would
think
that
you
would
use
drugs

but
the
guy
that
does
n't
fit
the
stereotype
of
uh
the
conservative
or
whatever
could
be
drug
tested

and

uh
you
know
whether
legal
rights
and
of
that
person

i
do
n't
know

there
's
certainly
a
lot
of
things
to
really
consider
uh
when
you
get
into
drug
testing
people
just
at
the
work
place
unless
of
course
like
i
said
they
have
a
large
responsibility
over
a
mass
of
people

uh
that
's
about
it

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

sure

and
i
think
that
's
what
companies
are
doing
uh
more
and
more
because
there
are
products
that
are
out
there

uh-huh

exactly

sure

sure

sure

exactly

the
only
thing
is

exactly

exactly

the
only
thing
is
uh

the
one
issue
that
i
would
take
stands
with
is
the
fact
that
the
drug
testing
itself
can
be
done
on
a
person
that
is
actually
not
on
drugs
and
come
out
positive

if
they
have
had
like
uh
medications
in
the
past
let
's
say
once
a
month
or
twice
a
month
or
three
times
a
month
or
maybe
that
week
they
take
an
advil

and
the
advil
will
apparently
come
out
positive
as
if
they
smoked
marijuana

uh
and
there
's
poppy
seed
type
things

i
think
that
everybody
is
aware
of
that

but
uh
where
's
the
line
where
you
where
you
say
to
somebody
i
'm
going
to
drug
test
you
tomorrow

so
please
do
not
take
these
medications

or
where
's

you
know
how
can
how
you
can
do
it

exactly

uh-huh

sure

sure

exactly

an-

and
th-
the
only
thing
that
i
would
say
on
that
is
it
could
blacklist
an
employee
later
on

let
's
say
uh
you
've
taken
medication
of
some
sort
even
though
they
usually
have
you
at
the
time
list
what
medications
you
've
taken

uh
let
's
say
you
do
come
out
positive

and
you
've
taken
advil
or
any
of
the
ibuprofen
products
out
there

or
you
've
had
a
cold

and
you
've
been
on
medication
or
whatever

you
come
out
positive

is
it
then
the
chance
that
the
employer
will
look
at
you
in
more
of
a
negative
fashion
and
say
well
you
know
this
is
kind
of
iffy
you
know

are
they
really
on
drugs

or
or
they
on
drugs

you
know
what
i
'm
saying

where
there
might
be
in
the
back
of
the
mind
of
the
employer
that
this
person
uh
is
on
drugs

or
make
up
they
may
make
up
their
mind
that
let
's
get
rid
of
this
employee

you
know
what
i
'm
saying

uh-huh

exactly

and
it
's
a

they
can
that
the

if
it
does
come
out
positive
the
first
time
they
need
to
go
back
and
find
out
what
medications
did
that
person
take

you
know
what
i
mean

it
it
's
kind
of
like
uh

i
think
most
people
are
aware
at
least
now
common
knowledge
is
that

so
what
is
your
opinion
on
on
drug
testing

well
yeah

it
it
it
's
just
not
the
com-

you
're
talking
about
company
's
liability

if
if
uh
if
the
company
is
liable
for
something
that
that
a
employee
does
while
under
the
influence
of
of
a
drug
you
know
then
by
all
means
they
should
have
the
right
to
to
to
to
to
minimize
their
liability

and
there
's
also
the
case
about
just
uh
uh
health
health
and
welfare
of
the
uh
employees

if
a
company
has
a
healthy
work
force
their
insurance
rates
are
low

and
not
only
a-
not
only
low
there
's
all
sorts
of
a
of
a
benefits
uh
financial
benefits
associated
with
having
you
know
having
people
file
fewer
claims
being
sick

there
there
's
the
whole
question
that
that
a
that
a
work
force
that
is
known
not
to
be
on
drugs
is
going
to
be
more
healthy

i
do
n't
think
anybody
would
argue
with
that

right

right

well
wel-

the
ques-

right

the
question
becomes
what
do
you
do
about
somebody
who
tests
who
tests
positive

d-

that
's
where
the
real
sticking
point
comes
in

it
's
not

i
do
n't
think
there
's
any
problem
with
testing
people

it
's
what
do
you
do
with
the
information

right

right

well
yeah

i
think
clearly
the
person
who
is
the
line
own-
the
line
manager

the
employee
should
not
be
privy
to
the
information
of
drug
testing

that
should
go
to
an
entirely
different
uh
agency
within
a
corporation

uh

uh
i
do
n't
know

your
camping
experience
is
probably

i
do
n't
know
if
they
're
similar
to
mine

but
uh
since
i
've
had
children
it
has
changed
a
little
bit

but
uh
when
my
husband
and
i
were
uh
camping
we
'd
take
this
domed
tent
that
uh
is
easily
collapsible
and
uh
go
camping
and
uh
just
kind
of
roughed
it

as
long
as
there
was
a
bathroom
there
and
some
clean
showers
and
things
like
that
then
it
was
fine

but
uh
we
'd
get
up
at
three
in
the
morning
and
start
on
our
little
uh
escapade
for
the
day
and
uh
kind
of
uh
do
a
lot
of
different
things
and
then
stop
when
we
wanted
to

but
uh
that
's
kind
of
changed
now

when
you
have
a
small
child
because
they
do
n't
want
to
get
up
at
three
in
the
morning

and
you
do
n't
want
them
up
that
early

oh
yeah

yeah

we
did
a
lot
of
different
things

we
'd
stop
when
we
wanted
to
that
kind
of
stuff

so
we
kind
of
did
a
little
bit
of
hiking
sure
and
a
little
bit
of
uh
sightseeing
uh
different
areas
uh
sitting
back
at
different
areas
and
spending
hours

we
never
had
really
a
time
limit

we
just
kind
of
did
what
we
wanted
to
do
for
that
day

very
comfortable

so

well
there
's
uh
places
in
wisconsin

there
's
the
apostle
islands
uh
which
are
in
bayfield
which
is
a
wonderful
place

and
then
there
's
also
uh
what
we
found
uh
in
the
state
of
uh
south
dakota
the
black
hills

and
we
just
have
this
uh
really
good
time
there

one
thing
is
they
do
n't
have
mosquitoes

and
uh
sorry
to
say
and
uh
in
wisconsin
we
do

so
that
kind
of
puts
a
little
bit
of
a
hamper
on
your
uh
you
know

if
if
you
're
going
to
go
camping
who
wants
to
deal
with
bugs

and
uh

we
found
this
one
area
that
does
n't
have
mosquitoes

they
just
do
n't
have
them

and
it
's
just
wonderful
not
to
be
bugged
all
night
long
with
a
humming
mosquito
at
your
ear

so
uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

sure

uh-huh

sure

yeah

yeah

that
was
really
called
roughing
it

yeah

i

anymore

yeah

see

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

than
you

sure

than
it
when
you
were
younger

uh-huh

i-
it

with
kids
they
do
n't
care
if
they
take
a
shower
everyday

with
kids
they
do
n't
care
you
know
uh
a
l-
about
a
lot
of
things

but
as
adults
uh
it
's
like
if
i
do
n't
take
a
shower
every
day
i
feel
like
you
know
ooh

i
i
just
do
n't
feel
right

so
there
's
lots
of
places
if
you
're
going
to
go
camping

k
o
a
-s
are
wonderful

it
's
kind
of
it
's
kind
of
the
uh
yuppie
type
of
camping
because
they
have
showers

they
have
things
for
kids
to
do

they
have
swimming
pools
things
like
that

if
you
can
find
uh
some
really
nice
clean
uh
campgrounds
versus
uh
if
you
go
to
state
parks
uh

we
have
found
state
parks
not
that
they
're
lacking

but
uh
they
're
certainly
not
up
to
a
standard
of
a
k
o
a
where
it
's
you
know
a
little
bit
cleaner

you
've
got
the
showers
available

it
's
not
you
know
in
the
same
category

state
parks
you
know
you
get
a
little
bit
fearful
too
uh
you
know
things
like
that
simply
because
it
they
are
supposed
to
be
patrolled

but
uh
you
know
it
's
it
's
a
little
bit
different

but
so
we
've
always
kind
of
stayed
with
a
k
o
a
and
then
uh
did
other
things
besides
just
sit
at
the
campground
at
night

that
's
the
only
time
you
really
use
your
campground

if
you
're
going
to
be
gone
all
day
long
walking
someplace
or
doing
tourism
or
whatever
uh
you
're
camping
really
is
just
for
like
in
the
evening
to
start
the
fire
to
sit
back
and
watch
a
fire
uh
to
enjoy
that
you
know
and
then
to
get
up
in
the
morning
and
get
a
shower
and
get
cleaned
up
that
kind
of
stuff

so
we
never
really
spent
that
much
time
at
the
campground
as
much
as
we
did

would
you
then
go
ha-
hiking

i
mean
would
the
camping
be
part
of
a
long
hike

um

were
you
up
in
in
wisconsin

or
would
you
go
into
can-

where
would
you
camp

uh-huh

oh
yeah

that
's
beautiful

right

oh
yeah

well
most
of
my
camping

i
have
n't
done
much
since
i
was
a
kid

but
uh
we
'd
basically
take
the
tent
up
in
the
sierras
and
uh
usually
just
camp
near
some
stream
or
some
lake

and
uh
just

it
was
n't
even
a
a
full
tent

it
would
be
more
a
tarp
uh
strung
up
between
trees

and
my
dad
would
take
uh
four
kids
my
brother
and
myself
and
two
cousins

and
uh
we
just
thought
it
was
absolute
heaven

uh
there
was
certainly
nothing
like
a
a
bathroom
a
shower
or
anything
near
by

it
was
dig
your
own
hole

and
uh
and
i
i
'm
not
sure
i
'd
do
that
that
anymore

but
it
's
it
uh
uh

actually
some
friends
of
mine
and
i
are
planning
to
camp
this
summer
uh
for
four
days

also
going
fishing
uh

and
i
have
a
idea
it
's
going
to
be
a
a
lot
more
equipment
and
a
lot
more
stuff
than
before

yeah

but

yeah

oh
my

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

huh

yeah

i
have
not
even
heard
believe
it
or
not
of
that
person

i
'm
not
kidding

when
you
when
you
said
it
it
was
kind
of
like
a
surprise

yeah

i
think
mainly
because
i
have
n't
been
watching
what
's
politically
going
on
uh
in
that
at-
you
know
in
that
aspect

i

as
far
as

like
now
the
new
house
bill
that
went
to
minnesota
uh
being
that
it
is
their
neighboring
state
and
that
i
lived
in
minnesota
i
'm
more
familiar
with
the
politics
that
involved
with
that
and
that
being
passed

but
uh
as
far
as
politics
in
the
grander
uh
part
of
it
as
if
you
want
to
look
at
uh
election
type
things
i
'm
not
quite
sure
even
if
i
'm
going
to
vote

uh
it
gets
harder
and
harder
each
time
an
election
comes
up
like
that
to
make
the
decision
on
who
would
be
the
best
to
run

uh
uh-huh

sure

exactly

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

sure

he
might
be
a
a
one
of
those

sure

uh
it
it
's
kind
of
when
you
think
back
of
the
old
politics
where
a
dirt
farmer
uh

when
you
think
of
some
of
the
best
presidents
we
've
had
in
the
past
have
been
people
that
have
struggled
to
get
to
the
top

i
mean
they
were
not
rich
in
in
any
means

and
it
has
been
kind
of
in
the
past
uh
i
do
n't
know
maybe
fifty
years
that
in
order
for
a
person
to
get
involved
with
politics
they
've
had
to
have
money

and
you
had
to
have
the
views
of
the
people
that
were
going
to
be
paying
your
way

uh
so
it
makes
the
common
person
uh

not
to
say
that
a
common
person
could
n't
run
for
government
and
do
a
fabulous
job
because
he
's
got
people
that
are
quite
intelligent

and
i
do
n't
know
if
we
'll
ever
see
that
you
know
where
a
common
person
could
ever
get
in
there
that
has
good
moral
standings
and
uh
has
uh
you
know

you
think
of
abraham
lincoln
and
you
know
just
the
background
of
abraham
lincoln
you
know
teaching
himself
to
read

he
did
n't
go
to
college

he
did
n't
you
know
do
all
the
other
things
that
uh
you
know
you
would
think
that
was
real
popular
to
do
and
to
get
po-
politically
involved
in
and
have
money

he
did
n't
come
from
money

uh
and
now
it
's

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

yeah

so
you
really
know
a
lot
of
his
background

it
was
the
big
one

it
's
the
one
that
everybody
wants

yeah

whether
or
not
i
you
know

you
look
at
all
these
candidates
that
want
to
become
president

i
really
have
to
ask
them
why
you
know

uh
it
's
the
toughest
job
in
the
world
to
do

and
not
only
that
you
do
n't
have
that
much
freedom
to
make
choices

i
mean
you
have
to
go
through
so
many
different

you
have
to
go
the
house
the
congress
and
all
of
the
o-
other
things
to
get
a
bill
passed

and
sure
you
can
veto
veto
it
at
the
last
minute

but
then
it
's
not
like
you
have
all
that
power

and
i
think
long
time
ago
presidents
did
have
a
lot
of
power

so
interesting
political
trends
or
events
huh

well
i
guess
the
uh
most
interesting
one
that
's
uh
going
on
right
now
from
my
perspective
is
this
uh
phenomena
of
uh
uh
ross
perot

uh
caught
his
interview
last
night
with
david
frost

and
it
was
the
the
first
time
i
had
you
know
heard
uh
his
views
expressed
by
himself

i
had
heard
other
people
talk
about
what
they
thought
he
believed
in

but
the
whole
phenomena
of
him
coming
out
of
uh
literally
nowhere
and
no
party
uh
at
least
no
apparent
party
support
on
either
side
is
pretty
interesting

uh-huh

like
out
of
nowhere

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

well
it
seems
that
the
decision
so
far
has
been
filtered
by
uh
you
know
party
politics
so
much
that
when
the
candidates
finally
get
party
approval
party
support
and
therefore
get
presented
to
the
public
the
the
candidates
are
already
beyond
what
uh
most
public
uh
feels
is
acceptable
behavior

you
know
the

one
of
the
common
criticisms
of
clinton
is
uh
gee
he
'll
say
or
do
anything
in
order
to
get
to
the
white
house

and
and
up
and
to
the
point
of
uh
perot
being
a
serious
candidate
it
seems
like
that
that
was
a
requirement
of
being
a
a
contender
within
the
party
is
to
have
done
all
those
things

i
mean
here
's
here
's
a
guy
who
for
twenty
years
has
been
working
toward
you
know
getting
the
party
nomination
and
and
preparing
himself
for
the
presidency

and
now
it
seems
like
both
he
and
the
incumbent
president
are
you
know
pretty
seriously
threatened
by
somebody
who
comes
out
of
a
whole
nonpolitical
arena

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

yeah

and
and
yet
even
he
was
a
a
consummate
politician
in
the
sense
that
uh
not
only
did
he
uh
fail
in
business
twice
with
bankruptcy
and
failure

but
he
lost
some
eighteen
elections
before
he
finally
won
one

and
the
first
d-
and
the
first
and
only
election
he
won
was
uh
the
presidency

he
he
had
lost
every
other
office
that
he
had
you
know

he
was
appointed
a
couple
of
times
to
like
uh
uh
state
legislator

yeah

then
then
when
he
finally
you
know
did
win
an
election
uh
you
know
it
was
the
presidency

yeah

yeah

but

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh
why
do
n't
you
go
ahead
first

sure

uh-huh

sure

that
's
kind
of
uh

to
what
we
're
doing
is
budgeting
you
know

month
to
month
is
uh
kind
of
taking
into
consideration
what
the
bills
are
and
what
's
extra

so
that
's
kind
of
how
we
do
it
uh
from
month
to
month
depending
on
what
insurance
is
due
or
whatever

uh
long
term
that
's
a
little
bit
easier
for
us
because
uh
with
our
jobs
we
can
take
out
extra
money
towards
savings
four
oh
one
k
plans
uh
that
kind
of
you
know
retirement
plans
that
kind
of
stuff

so
we
can
kind
of
put
aside
some
money
that
actually
is
better
for
us
not
to
see
versus
when
it
's
on
the
paycheck

and
you
have
to
try
and
take
out
some
of
that
money

you
always
find
something
a
little
extra
that
you
'd
like
to
get
that
month

so
uh
long
term
probably
is
a
little
bit
better
than
short
term
simply
because
uh
it
's
automatically
taken
out

so
uh
that
works
out
much
better
for
us

so
that
's
kind
of
how
we
do
it
anyway

but

e-
exactly

and
if
you
ca
n't
touch
it
you
ca
n't
spend
it
either

so
that
kind
of
works
out
where
you
get
into
uh
some
plans
that
you
know
you
touch
it
you
're
going
to
get
a
penalty
that
kind
of
thing

so
it
leads
you
to
kind
of
say
well
i
'm
not
going
to
take
it
out

i
'm
going
to
keep
it
and
uh
keep
it
in
there
and
let
it
grow
so
that
someway
maybe
for
retirement
you
're
going
to
have
that
money
left

let
's
hope
anyway

so
you
'll
have
that

so
that
's
kind
of
how
we
do
it

but
ours
is
more
like
month
to
month
too
uh

short
term
is
to
get
things
going

so
anyway
other
than
that
uh
is
kind
of
how
we
do
it

so
i
do
n't
know
if
we
're
our
time
is
up
or
what

they
'll
let
us
know

uh-huh

oh
definitely

definitely

and
uh
it
grows
uh

it
it
seems
like
at
first
you
're
not
going
to
see
a
big
return

but
as
the
years
go
on
if
you
're
with
the
company
for
any
length
of
time
then
it
gets
much
better

and
uh
so
you
know
you
just
have
to
kind
of
look
at
it
that
way

and
there
's
other
savings
plans
or
other
things
that
you
can
do

automatic
you
know
deposit
from
checks
to
where
you
do
n't
see
it

and
uh
you
know
exactly
whatever
is
in
our
checking
account
is
basically
just
about
what
gets
spent

it
's
put
into
our
savings
account

and
we
do
n't
see
it

then
it
works
out
to
where
you
know
you
do
n't
look
at
it

you
just
look
at
the
checking
account
and
say
this
is
what
we
have
for
money

and
that
's
it

so

yeah

it
it
's
easy
because
you
do
spend
it

that
's
for
sure

like
i
said
you
know
you
kind
of
look
at
it
uh

you
better
have
some
other
way
of
uh
savings

otherwise
uh
checking
accounts
are
n't
the
best
for
you
know
long
term
type
of
planning

so
and
you
do
n't
get
a
good
return
on
it
anyway

so
other

exactly

right
now

yeah

it
's
a
bad
time
you
know

uh-huh

uh-huh

exactly

exactly

you
know
we
have
some
in-laws
uh
that
uh
had
theirs
in
some
money
market
certificates
and
other
things
and
uh
kind
of
took
them
out
of
that
because
they
got
so
low

but
uh

yeah

it
's
it
drops

so
your
better
bet
is
to
uh
try
to
get
in
with
something
with
your
corporation
if
they
have
some
kind
of
uh
savings
plans
or
something
like
that
to
where
they
kind
of
match
the
percentage
or
whatever
so
or
some
kind
of
profit
sharing

so

sure

yeah

that
's
great

yeah

okay

yeah

exactly

okay

uh
short
term
uh
it
works
out
pretty
well
because
we
have
just
enough
to
cover
expenses
with
a
little
left
over

so
budgeting
in
the
short
term
is
n't
too
much
of
an
issue
because
there
's
not
that
much
uh
extra
to
go
around

uh
long
term
is
something
we
're
starting
to
think
about
because
our
older
child
will
be
ready
for
college
in
about
uh
gee

she
's
eight
now

so
i
guess
about
ten
years

good
heavens

so
we
're
we
're
starting
to
think
about
long
term
considerations
college
and
retirement

but
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
discretionary
money
it
's
kind
of
hard
to
figure
out
how
to
do
it

how
about
you

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

and
the
old
uh
if
you
ca
n't
see
it
then
you
ca
n't
spend
it
uh
idea

right

uh-huh

uh
they
'll
uh

yeah

exactly

we
we
actually
do
have
some
money
in
a
four
oh
one
k

i
just
wish
i
could
afford
to
uh
put
more
away
each
week
because
i
agree
that
it
's
a
an
excellent
way

right

yeah

yeah

checking
account
's
a
very
dangerous
place
for
money
to
be
i
'm
convinced

yeah

i
guess
there
other
than
things
like
the
stock
market
or
mutual
funds
there
's
really
not
much
of
a
return
on
anything
these
days

yeah

the
interest
is
so
low

i
mean
it
it
's
nice
for
people
buying
homes

but
for
older
people
who
have
money
in
c
d
-s
or
whatever
it
must
be
awfully
hard
to
see
rates
go
down
to
three
and
a
half
percent
or
whatever

yeah

i
'm
i
'm
with
a
small
company
now

and
i
hope
that
uh
if
we
're
successful
that
they
'll
go
in
for
some
sort
of
profit
sharing

that
'll
be
very
nice

well
i
guess
we
're
kind
of
running
out
of
steam
on
this
topic
here

okay

well
uh
just
briefly

uh
i
worked
in
a
nursing
home

so
i
kind
of
know
from
way
back
uh
how
things
used
to
be
run

and
i
think
there
has
been
definite
changes
of
nursing
homes

but
i
think
uh
if
i
had
to
personally
put
one
of
my
parents
in
a
nursing
home
they
would
have
to
be
pretty
bad
off
to
where
i
could
n't
take
care
of
them
at
all

it
would
be
something
that
you
know
i
would
certainly

if
they
're
forgetting
things
or
whatever
i
'd
prefer
to
have
them
at
home
or
have
them
in
what
they
call
now
home
care
where
somebody
comes
in

and
they
cook
meals

and
they
clean
their
house
for
them

that
kind
of
thing

so
they
still
have
their
own
independence

and
not
reliable
you
know

they
do
n't
have
to
be
in
a
nursing
home
situation

but
uh
i
do
n't
think

the
nursing
homes
when
i
was
working
in
them
were
very
much
understaffed
very
much
uh
in
need
of
good
personnel
uh

i
think
the
patients
were
n't
given
the
quality
of
care
that

i
would
n't
have
you
know

i
look
at
it
and
say
thank
god

i
got
out
of
that
kind
of
situation

but
they
they
were
not
given
the
time

and
they
were
not
given
the
money
basically
to
staff
appropriately
people
to
help

and
i
can
remember
lifting
a
patient
all
by
myself
simply
because
there
was
not
another
person
to
help

it
's
either
le-
leave
the
patient
in
bed
all
day
long
or
get
them
up

and
i
would
have
preferred
to
get
them
up
than
to
leave
them
in
bed
all
day

but
uh
uh
so
i
think
nursing
homes
are
have
changed

i
'm
not
quite
sure

but
hopefully
they
have

uh-huh

yeah

sure

uh-huh

sure

yeah

i
i
think
that
's
that
can
happen

and
i
think
in
the
nursing
home
that
i
worked
for

i
was
n't
quite
sure
of
it

but
i
'm
sure
that
some
of
the
patients
were
uh
given
medication
to
keep
them
in
uh
quiet

and
and

yeah

yeah

and
they
would
just
lay
all
day
long

and
uh
the
ones
tha-

they
also
put
mentally
ill
patients
in
the
same

they
were
not
on
the
same
you
know
ward

but
they
they
were
in
the
same
nursing
home

so
that
these
mentally
ill
patients
could
walk
into
where
the
other
uh
older
people
that
were
in
there
for
reasons
of
uh
you
know
age
uh

the
mentally
ill
patients
could
walk
right
in
into
the
rooms
or
do
whatever
they
wanted
to
basically

because
if
you
were
n't
there
to
watch
them
and
keep
them
in
their
own
wing
they
could
they
had
freedom
to
just
walk
around

and
a
lot
of
them
were
i
think
there
was
a
couple
that
were
schizophrenic

and
i
remember
one
time
watching
one
of
the
uh
schizophrenic
patients
actually
go
out
on
i
do
n't
know
what
they
call
it
a
binge
or
whatever
you
want
to
say
it

she
grabbed
a
hold
of
this

and
it
was
kind
of
funny
when
i
looked
back
at
it

but
i
mean
i
remember
the
patient
getting
very
upset

that
woman
actually
pulled
uh
the
other
person
's
hair

i
mean
she
just
came
up
right
behind
him
and
pulled
his
hair
you
know

and
it
was
a
guy
that
was
just
really
upset

i
mean
he
said
what
the
hell
are
you
think
you
're
doing
you
know

and
i
laughed
at
it
then

but
then
i
'm
thinking
god
you
know

if
i
had
to
put
my
parents
in
that
nursing
home
i
would
n't
want
them
there

so
i
think
there
's
laws
now
that
kind
of
protect
that
nursing
homes
either
have
to
keep
the
mentally
ill
totally
away
from
these
people
and
not
in
the
same
type
of
facilities

even
though
they
're
aging
mentally
ill
they
are
still
mentally
ill

and
a
lot
of
these
older
people
have
their
you
know
they
're
not
insane
or
anything
like
that

they
do
n't
have
these
tendencies
to
to
lash
out

but
seeing
that
kind
of
made
me
think
twice
about

jeez

i
would
n't
put
my
mother
father
in
that
nursing
home
at
all

a
small
town

yeah

yeah

i
do
n't
know

i
do
n't
know

i
i
kind
of
look
at
it
this
way

i
think
if
you
have
a
big
city
area
i
think
there
's
more
people
to
keep
watch
on
it

and

yeah

yeah

and
you
have
more
competition

and
i
think
nursing
homes
have
to
be
better
than
when
there
's
one
nursing
home
for
a
whole
community

and
this
is
back
in
nineteen
seventy-seven
that
i
worked
there

and
i
look
back
at
it
and
say
jeez
you
know

i-
it
would
have
to
be
awfully
bad
for
me
to
put
my
parents
in
there

but
my
grandmother
uh
later
on
got
cancer
and
uh
could
no
longer

well
actually
she

uh-huh

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

wel-
th-
i
guess
i
have
n't
had
that
much
experience

i
've
only
seen
like
my
great
grandparents
in
a
nursing
home

but
i
have
an
aunt
who
lived
on
her
own
until
she
was
well
in
her
nineties

and
then
she
she
got
sick

and
she
ended
up
in
nursing
home

and
my
parents
went
to
visit
her

and
it
got
to
the
point
where
the
nur-
it
seemed
like
the
nursing
home
did
n't
want
to
deal
wi-
her
anymore

and
so
they
gave
her
drugs
to
keep
her
asleep

nice
sedative
state

uh-huh

yeah

to
be
violent

was
this
in
a
big
town
or
a
little
town

oh
really

because
it
seems
like
the
small
town
nursing
homes
there
's
a
lot
more
personal
attention

uh-huh

you
have
more
options

uh-huh

uh
taxes

do
you
want
to
go
ahead

uh-huh

i
agree

uh-huh

well
i
think
uh
you
know
when
i
look
at
uh
all
the
things
that
are
coming
out
now
about
over
spending
and
spending
money
that
's
not
there
and
buying
things
that
are
extremely
expensive
where
they
could
buy
it
at
a
at
a
better
discount
uh

when
you
when

exactly

exactly

that
's
exactly
uh
the
whole
thing

when
you
take
a
look
at
all
those
issues
of
where
our
money
is
going

and
it
's
just

as
long
as
the
person
that
's
spending
the
money
uh
does
n't
think
about

oh
i
can
go
out
and
spend
anything
that
i
want
to

it
's
just
unlimited

right

an
unlimited
source

so
they
they
think
well
i
'll
go
out
and
buy
a
four
hundred
toilet
seat

and
i
could
have
went
to
k-mart
and
bought
it
for
you
know
ten
or
fifteen

i
mean
that
kind
of
thing

and
uh

exactly

exactly

and
i
know
a
lot
of
uh
corporations
now
are
looking
at
their
amount
of
money
that
's
being
spent

and
they
're
looking
at
what
's
the
best
buy

it
used
to
be
you
could
go
if
you
had
a
company
you
had
to
go
through
certain
people

and
you
did
n't
care
what
you
paid

i
mean
you
just
got
it
done

now
people
are
putting
in
bids
for
things
and
are
looking
at
things

going
to
actually
shop
at
best
buy
for
best
buy
is
one
of
our
electronic
stores
for
fax
machines
things
like
that
instead
of
going
through
these
office
supply
companies
that
mark
up
their
amounts
and
say
you
know
i
'll
give
you
a
legal
pad
for
five
bucks

and
you
can
go
to
another
shop
and
get
it
for
maybe
sixty
cents
or
nin-
or
ninety
cents

that
kind
of
thing

so

except
for
everything
keeps
going
up
you
know

and
i
know
as
a
middle
class
uh
you
know

and
also
i
have
one
dependent
has
my
daughter

and
i
keep
looking
at
well
where
's
the
tax
so-called
tax
uh
relief
for
having
children

i
mean
there
is
none

i
mean
i
think
i
paid
just
as
much
as
when
i
did
n't
have
her

so

uh-huh

sure

exactly

uh-huh

exactly

yeah

that
's
the
whole
thing

now
they
have
gotten
this
wonderful
idea
of
not
taking
out
as
much
taxes

but
you
're
still
going
to
owe
the
government
as
much
money

so
by
the
end
of
this
coming
year
what
's
going
to
happen
is
all
these
people
are
going
to
find
out
that
they
owe
the
government

and
it
certainly
is
n't
going
to
be
in
their
savings
uh
account

they
wo
n't
be
able
to
pay
it

and
there
'll
be
a
lot
of
problems
because
of
that
you
know

put
people
into
you
know
january
or
february
which
is
always
suppose
to
be

the
month
after
christmas
is
supposed
to
be
high
spending
because
everything
is
on
sale

nobody
's
going
to
have
the
money
to
spend

they
're
going
to
be
paying
on
their
taxes

so
they
're
going
to
have
to
just
cut
back

so
i
do
n't
know
where
the
answer
is

and

yeah

yeah

no

no

well
that
's
the
whole
thing

i
think
people
are
getting
so
fed
up
with
it

now
we
go
through
another
election
and
listen
to
all
these
lies
about
the

no

no

well
i
do
n't
think
people
think
they
can
make
a
difference

and
when
you
've
got
candidates
as
you
do

it
's
candidates
that
have
money

and
it
's
backed
by
big
business

and
big
business
says
well
we
do
n't
care
about
the
little
person

and
uh
you
know
you
're
not
going
to
get
anymore
abe
lincolns
around

uh-huh

well
who
knows
uh

yeah

generations
from
now
we
might
uh
set
back
in
our
little
uh
rocking
chairs
and
watch
our
grandchildren
go
through
an
entirely
different
system
of
things
and
say
you
know
this
government
itself
is
n't
working

just
like
the
communist
government
of
uh
the
old
u
s
s
r

and
maybe
that
's
going
to
happen
to
america
where
they
'll
say
hey

we
're
fed
up

maybe
it
'll
have
to
be
just
individual
state
tax

and
each
state
take
care
of
itself
and
no
government
type
of
uh
you
know

where
you
have
to
pay
out
to
federal
or
whatever

i
do
n't
know

who
knows

but

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

everybody
is

in
fact
i
'm
not
sending
in
my
check

sure

we
pay
far
too
much
in
taxes

well
far
too
much
for
what
we
get

i
mean
it
's
just
i
do
n't
know
it
ju-
just
seems
too
much
of
the
money
is
just
lost

um

you
mean
like
those
you
know
twenty
thousand
dollar
toilets

sure

it
's
real
easy
to
spend
other
people
's
money

right

right

e-
i
do
n't
mind
them
getting
what
they
need

it
's
just
when
they
pay
so
much
for
it

it
takes
you
know
very
little
to
just
shop
around
and

that
's
true

yep

right

yeah

i
'm
also
wondering
why
our
taxes
are
still
so
high
considering
like
the
world
's
probably
in
better
shape
now
than
it
has
been
in
the
last
fifty
years

uh-huh

yeah

i
know

oh
i
know

i
mean
i
do
n't
even
you
know
i
do
n't
even
get
to
see
half
my
paycheck

between
four
oh
one
k
and
and
the
thirty-four
percent
they
're
taking
out
for
taxes

let
alone
what
i
end
up
having
to
pay

sure

nope

they
wo
n't
be
able
to
pay

sure

none

i
do
n't

in
the
first
place
you
know
there
's
also
like
taxation
without
representation

well
i
do
n't
feel
represented
anymore
in
our
government

i
mean
it
it
's
certainly
not
a
government
for
me

it
does
n't
take
care
of
my
needs

an-
and
people
do
n't
care
anymore
either

people
do
n't
want
to
go
out
to
vote

yep

no

but
but
that
that
's
going
to
backfire
because
little
people
who
buy
everything

so

yeah

yeah

i
wonder
though

yeah

i
'm
not

i
do
n't
know

i
ca
n't
think
of
any
easy
answers
to
it

but
something
has
to
happen

i
mean
i
'm
certainly
fed
up
with
it

okay

um
i
guess
if
i
had
to
rate
it
from
one
to
ten
i
guess
i
would
rate
it
a
five
in
the
aspect
that
i
would
n't
want
everybody
to
have
guns

and
i
think
there
should
be
limitations
of
like
semiautomatics

uh
things
like
that
should
not
be
just
given
out
to
anybody

in
fact
you
know
i
ca
n't
imagine
anybody
having
a
semiautomatic
for
what
purpose

uh
so
i
guess
you
know
being
that
i
come
from
a
hunting
family
i
'd
rather
have
some
restrictions
put
on
weapons
but
yet
allow
hunting
rifles
uh
things
that
people
would
use
for
sporting
type
of
uh
a
activity

those
would
be
fine

but
when
you
get
into
a
a
lot
of
the
more
complex
weapons
i
would
say
yes

we
need
to
put
restrictions
on
them

uh-huh

uh-huh

exactly

for
self-protection

sure

i
ca
n't
imagine
that

yeah

uh-huh

to
do
massive
amounts
of
killing
uh

yeah

the
only
thing
that
i
can
see
is
the
police
having
it
in
a
case
where
somebody
is
uh
uh
you
know
going
to
kill
a
massive
amount
of
people
or
uh
somebody
that
's
escaping
that
's
uh
very
dangerous

semiautomatic
would
allow
more
rounds
to
be
put
out
to
hopefully
catch
the
person
and
and
uh
get
him
down

but
uh
you
know
i
i
think
of
my
family

uh
they
're
very
much
into
sporting
and
uh
you
know
as
far
as
hunting
and
also
like
uh
clay
pigeons
things
like
that

so
they
have
may
have
some
shotguns

they
may
have
other
type
of
uh
hunting
type
things

but
i
figured
if
the
if
the
criminals
had
to
take
a
hunting
gun
out
to
kill
somebody
more
than
likely
somebody
would
see
it
you
know
what
i
'm
saying
versus
a
you
know
a
small
handgun
uh
that
can
be
you
know
put
right
in
your
coat
pocket

and
nobody
would
see
it

but
yet
you
ca
n't
stop
people
from
having
you
know
a
handgun
in
their
home

even
if
there
are
small
children
around
there
's
you
know
you
ca
n't
say
people
with
small
children
ca
n't
have
guns

and
people
without
small
children
that
may
have
grandchildren
you
know
still
have
these
guns

but
uh
i
guess
i
i
was
always
taught
number
one
a
gun
is
n't
a
toy

uh
you
know
and
i
do
n't
know
if
that
makes
a
difference
if
the
parent
sets
down
to
them
and
say
this
gun
can
kill
you
you
know
and
do
n't
ever
play
with
it

uh
so
i
do
n't
know
if
that
makes
a
difference
or
what

but

uh-huh

the
criminals
would
get
them
i
mean
even
if
they
had
to
go
across
border
to
get
them

uh-huh

how
to
use
you
know
to
make
sure
the
guns
are
put
up
as
something
as
uh
not
a
toy

yeah

because
we
had
guns
all
over
our
house
when
we
were
kids

and
not
that
they
were
laying
on
the
uh
couch
or
anything
like
that

but
uh
i
never
had
an
interest
in
them
being
in
the
fact
that
i
knew
that
guns
could
kill

and
i
had
four
brothers
and
never
messed
with
any
type
of
guns

and
so
it
was
kind
of
the
idea
that
we
knew
that
a
gun
could
kill
and
that
a
gun
was
n't
a
toy

and
of
course
we
were
quite
young

and
we
went
through
uh
the
national
rifle
uh
club

and
so
we
were
taught
you
know
kind
of
at
a
a
good
age
ten
and
eleven
and
twelve
to
sit
down
with
a
kid
and
say
okay

if
you
're
going
to
learn
how
to
shoot
a
gun
you
're
going
to
learn
how
to
do
it
correctly

and
you
're
going
to
learn
how
to
have
safeguards
and
and
know
how
to
protect
yourself

but
yet
have
this
training
so
that
kids
are
n't
you
know

they
have
to
have
a
certain
respect
for
it

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

sure

yeah

yes

yeah

yeah

i
think
so

an-
and
i
do
n't
know
if
the
kids
nowadays
are
different
than
what

uh-huh

uh
that
's
pro-
i
probably
would
have
to
agree
with
you
pretty
much
all
the
way
i
think

uh
i
definitely
think
that
there
some
things
should
n't
be
limited
like
like
you
said
rifles
and
uh
hunting
rifles
and
possible
handguns
for
people
who
use
them
to

right

and
but
i
think
the
i
think
semiautomatic
weapons
people
say
they
use
them
because
it
for
sport

but
i
i
personally
cannot
see
any
use
for
them
other
than
uh
for
for
like
people
who
dislike
have
some
sort
of
crazed
you
know
ambition
to
use
have
high
powered
weapons
or
something

right

and
i
mean
you
can
only
how
much
do
you
wa-

uh-huh

right

right

uh-huh

right

yeah

yeah

that
's
true

right

uh-huh

yeah

right

right

uh-huh

right

well
i
think
par-
uh
in
that
ca-
i
think
that
cases
like
that
it
's
definitely
um
i
think
if
you
're
to
say
okay

we
have
to
get
rid
of
them
all
because
you
know
they
can
only
they
only
seem
to
do
bad
it
it
's
uh
it
's
saying
we
're
t-

right

right

and
people
who
people
who
have
them
and
are
responsible
with
them
are
are
are
being
punished

and
people
who
and
they
're
saying
that
people
you
cannot
take
care
of
things
yourself
or
like
that
you
're
not
smart
enough
to
teach
your
kids
how
to
how
to
uh

right

right

uh-huh

right

uh-huh

right

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

well
i
think
i
mean
we
i
grew
up
in
a
family

and
and
my
father
had
two
guns

because
he
used
to
hunt
years
ago

but
he
stopped
before
really
before
i
was
old
enough
to
remember

but
and
i
knew
we
had
the
guns
in
the
house

and
th-
the
time
my
father
was
keeping
them
just
for
protection
at
the
time

but
we
it
was
never
my
brothers
sisters
nor
i
never
i
mean
none
of
us
ever
thought
well
let
's
go
look
at
the
gun

or
let
's
go
get
the
gun

it
was
just
something
you
knew
was
there

and
th-
it
was
your
father
's

and
y-
you
that
was
not
something
you
'd
go
and
play
played
with
at
all

and
i
think
maybe
uh
and
that
's
the
type
of
the
thing
that
should
be
you
know
stressed

well
uh
preferred
benefits
uh

i
worked
for
a
large
corporation
in
the
past

and
i
think
large
corporations
can
give
better
benefits
than
small
corporations
because
right
now
i
'm
working
for
a
very
small
corporation
where
the
owner
is
right
there

and
uh
there
is
a
lot
of
profit
that
's
coming
in

but
when
it
comes
to
uh
small
corporations
they
seem
to
pocket
it
a
little
bit
quick
quickly
or
whatever
or
however
you
want
to
say
it

and
uh
the
benefits
are
n't
as
great
when
i
worked
for
a
big
corporation
because
the
big
corporations
seem
to
look
at
its
employees
and
say
okay

we
've
got
this
amount
of
money

let
's
put
into
this
plan
this
plan

you
got
four
oh
one
k
plans

you
have
uh
better
vacation
plans
uh

you
have
just
in
general
maternity
leave
plans
tha-
that
kind
of
thing

big
corporations
are
able
to
do
that
versus
small
corporations
uh
you
know

they
just
do
n't
have
the
money
or
just
feel
that
there
is
n't
the
need
for
it

so
i
've
worked
for
both
big
and
small

so
i
've
had
a
chance
to
kind
of
take
a
look
at
uh
the
pros
and
cons
of
both

sure

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

huh

sure

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

that
's
pretty
good
for
you
know
being
a
a
school
district
type
program

uh-huh

wow

that
's
extremely
good

like
the
small
corporation
that
i
work
for
there
's
no
pension
plan

there
's
no
type
of
uh
savings
of
any
sort
that
the
company
will
reimburse
you
for

there
's
really

i
think
you
're
allowed
so
many
times
uh
i
think
two
or
three
days
a
w-
a
year

it
's
not
accumulative
type
of
sick
leave
uh
you
know
things
like
that

so
i
've
been
looking
at
big
corporations
and
saying
the
big
corporation
that
i
've
worked
for
in
the
past
had
the
pension
plans
had
the
big
health
health
care
uh

you
had
your
insurance

and
you
did
n't
have
to
pay
in
as
much
as
if
you
go
to
a
a
very
small
place

uh
they
do
n't
have
as
good
as
insurance
packages
as
big
corporations

and

uh-huh

sure

no

yeah

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

sure

sure

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

is
it
a
union

uh-huh

oh
that
's
pretty
good

uh-huh

sure

yeah

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

i
know
what
you
mean

and
that
's
true

i
mean
yo-
i-
it
does
end
up
being
quite
a
bit
when
you
have
to
hire
somebody
for
that
position
sure

yeah

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

well
that
's
it
you
know

and
and
i
've
kind
of
looked
around
uh
at
that
uh
too

because
uh
salary
wise
i
do
n't
think
i
'm
making
as
much
with
a
big
corporation
because
i
think
when
you
look
at
big
corps
or
large

i
'm
talking
like
hugh
companies
like
three
m
uh
i
'm
uh
honeywell
uh
texas
instruments

i
know
people
that
are
that
have
vacation
times
and
bene-
benefits
that
i
would
n't
even
dream
of
in
a
small
corporation

you
bring
it
up
to
the
owner

and
it
's
like
come
on
you
know

partly
it
's
because
the
owner
wants
to
keep
getting
richer
and
richer

and
and
of
course
when
it
's
a
small
corporation
it
also
wants
to
expand

so
that
money
is
spent

uh-huh

right

well
i
've
worked
for
uh
well
i
worked
for
h
and
r
block
here
in
massachusetts
for
awhile

and
the
only

they
even
hate
to
give
out
unemployment
at
the
end
of
tax
season
because
they
you
know
they
're
fairly
even
though
they
're
a
large
scale
company
they
're
very
the
offices
the
individual
offices
are
very
small

and
now
i
work
for
the
framingham
school
tea-
system
because
i
'm
a
teacher

and
uh
we
have
much
better
benefits
you
know
in
the
system

we
have
a
good
pension
plan

uh
let
me
see
we
have
a
profit
sharing
plan
to
a
degree

right

and
we
have
the
eye
glasses
the
health
care
and
the
whole
kit
and
caboodle
because
what
they
did
is
they
threw
all
the
town
employees
in
together

yeah

really

oh

right

the
only
trouble
we
've
had
here
in
massachusetts
is
the
town
and
state
employees
have
run
into
problems
especially
the
retired
ones

my
father
's
retired
from
the
town
of
framingham

and
he
said
that
they
have
n't
gotten
a
a
cost
of
living
raise
in
over
five
years

and
he
said
that
's
the
only
thing
that
really
stinks
as
far
as
being
retired

and
but
i
hear
that
bill
is
in
the
senate
right
now

and
it
's
hopefully
will
go
through

but
uh
you
know
i
think
the
schools
are
at
where
the
schools
is
n't
just
the
school
system
and
not
just
the
teachers

they
took
in
the
whole
town
plus
all
you
know

uh
we
have
the
teachers
union
which
helps
out
a
lot

but
the
town
of
framingham
pays
the
benefits

and
that
's
all
the
town
workers
water
and
sewer

and
where
it
's
a
very
large
town

it
's
actually
should
be
a
city

but
they
kept
it
a
town

uh
where
it
's
extremely
large
they
were
able
to
offer
a
little
bit
more
which
was
really
great
because
we
do
n't
have
to
pay
a
mayor

right

because
of
most
of
our
you
know
the
town
employees
as
far
as
uh
electoral
positions
are
part-time

so
it
works
out
good
because
we
reap
the
benefits
of
it

and
uh
but
as
far
as
shopping
for
a
job
i
'd
rather
shop
for
the
benefits
than
the
salary

right

right

i
do
n't
know
if
you
feel
the
same

but
uh
when
it
comes
to
telling
kids
that
they
have
to
do
uh
two
or
three
years
of
service
into
some
kind
of
community
i
do
n't
know
if
that
's
appropriate
for
a
government
to
suggest
that
and
say
you
know
you
have
to
do
two
years
of
community
service
before
you
can
be
a
citizen

or
you
know
in
the
aspect
that
we
're
telling
kids
that
this
is
what
is
suggested
for
you
to
do

and
uh
i
as
far
as
a
high
school
course
i
could
see
it
as
uh
maybe
a
social
uh
sociology
course
to
where
a
student
would
get
credits
if
they
were
to
be
involved
with
some
kind
of
community
type
of
program

and
to
me
that
's
fine
to
have
a
student
do
that
for
like
four
or
even
a
year

but
to
tell
them
that
they
had
to
do
two
years
thereafter
post
high
school
of
community
service
i
i
'm
not
quite
sure
if
that
's
appropriate
for
anybody
to
be
telling
somebody
they
have
to
do

uh-huh

exactly

right

right

uh-huh

exactly

and
doing
it
for
a
purpose
that
they
want

the
other
thing
is
this

i
have
thought
about
this
on
many
times
when
you
get
these
uh
young
troubled
teenagers
that
uh
do
n't
have
like
the
perspective
of
uh
uh
of
the
community
a
sense
of
community
or
perhaps
the
sense
that
they
may
have
problems

but
there
are
other
people
out
in
the
community
that
may
have
problems

then
i
can
see
it
as
like
maybe
a
probationary
type
of
thing

you
have
to
do
so
much
as
far
as
in
community
service
now

if
they
were
you
know
th-
abusive
type
of
situation
perhaps
then
they
would
have
to
work
with
the
victims
of
abuse

or
if
uh
they
destroyed
some
property
around
the
uh
area
then
they
would
have
to
do
uh
to
restore
it
and
perhaps
uh
work
uh
for
the
community
to
beautify
it
or
whatever

but
i
could
see
that
working
in
you
know
cases
where
it
might
be
young
teenagers
getting
in
trouble
with
law
and
teaching
him
that
there
is
a
whole
community
that
is
effected
when
they
strike
out
and
do
their
crimes
or
whatever

and
that
's
i
think
they
have
done
that

and
judges
have
said
well
you
know
this
is
what
you
're
going
to
get
for
a
you
know
a
misd-
misdemeanor
or
something

you
may
end
up
having
to
do
some
kind
of
community
service

so
i
could
see
that
as
something
that
might
occur
in
the
court
system
for
those
that
are
troubled

so

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

we
sure
do

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

yeah

uh-huh

uh-huh

exactly

yeah

uh-huh

and
there
's
a
lot
of
anger
sure
you
know
especially
if
they
have
n't
went
through
treatment

and
they
dealt
with
other
people
in
the
uh
system
of
prisons
which
uh
you
you
always
deal
with
somebody
that
's
a
little
bit
worse
than
yourself
next
to
you
or
whatever

i
would
say
the
crimes
would
probably
be
you
know

if
you
went
in
for
a
certain
crime
there
might
somebody
that
has
done
a
crime
even
worse
than
what
you
have

so
you
're
dealing
with
people
uh
that
may
uh
be
an
influence
later
on

and
uh
an
issue
of
anger
would
be
is
that
i
went
to
prison
for
a
year
or
two

but
i
did
n't
get
any
rehabilitation

or
uh
you
know
but
then
again
those
that
have
physically
assaulted
somebody
uh
that
's
extremely
tough
to
put
them
into
some
kind
of
program
out
in
the
community
if
they
're
of
a
violent
sort
and
to
say

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

um
well
that
's
a
good
idea
to
have
it
as
a
study
program
for
school
where
it
be
more
on
a
voluntary
basis
as
opposed
to
uh
mandatory

yeah

a

yeah

i
kind
of
agree
with
that

uh
i
do
n't
think

you
know
i-
it
they
should
have
they
should
have
the
same
rights
as
anyone
else
you
know

it
should
n't
be
uh
anything
should
n't
be
mandatory
other
than
i
guess
like
uh
when
you
come
to
paying
taxes
or
something
like
that

uh
or
if
it
's
beneficial
in
some
kind
of
way
then
maybe
uh
people
be
more
eager
to
do
it

yeah

right

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh
that
's
a
good
idea

uh
i
think
they
should
have
more
programs
like
that

and
i
think
uh
us
being
taxpayers
we
pay
for
uh
people
that
's
in
jail
or
in
trouble
anyway

so
they
should
be
programs
set
up
by
the
government
that
could
utilize
those
forms
in
different
areas

and
i
i
agree
wholeheartedly

yeah

but
uh
the
thing
is
is
that
's
not
enough
of
that
kind
of
stuff
going
on
uh

because
like
you
say
is
a
lot
of
crimes
and
stuff
or
misdemeanors

so
why
have
someone
in
year-
jail
for
a
year
or
two
for
a
misdemeanor

and
sometimes
you
know
putting
them
in
jail
does
n't
really
help
because
there
's
nothing
in
there
that
would
reb-
rehabilitate
re-
rehabilitate
rehabilitate
them

and
then
when
they
get
out
they

because
they
have
this
stigmatism
of
being
in
jail

uh-huh

uh-huh

right

uh
i
do
n't
know
about
you

but
uh
i
work
outside
the
home

and
uh
in
fact
uh
i
'll
be
leaving
very
shortly
to
go
to
work

and
i
work
different
shifts
so
are
pretty
much
a
later
shift
to
where
i
do
n't
have
i
do
n't
have
the
family
time

uh
when
my
husband
gets
home
it
's
usually
he
's
home
with
my
daughter
alone

and
then
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
'm
home

uh
i
do
n't
know

i
'm
finding
that
more
and
more
people
that
i
talk
to
there
's
less
and
less
family
time
available
to
them

and
uh
it
seems
that
business
wise
uh
in
the
business
community
or
your
employers
seem
to
be
taking
more
and
more
time
away
from
the
family

so
you
know
if
you
do
have
any
time
it
's
kind
of
like
on
a
rush
cycle
that
you
have
to
get
so
many
other
things
done
uh
ju-
just
to
maintain
your
home
and
maintain
the
things
outside
your
home
and
then
plus
try
to
have
that
relationship
with
your
children

and
it
it
's
sometimes
a
very
it
it
's
a
very
hard
juggling
act

and
you
know
i
look
at
my
daughter

and
she
's
now
uh
four
going
to
be
four

and
i
keep
saying
oh
jeez
i
do
n't
have
that
much
time
with
her

and
she
's
growing
fast

and

uh-huh

uh-huh

yes

yeah

sure

exactly

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

exactly

uh-huh

sure

sure

uh-huh

yeah

yeah

sure

sure

sure

yeah

i
i

i
think
so
too

in
fact
uh
i
spent
the
first
three
years
at
home
with
my
daughter

so
i
i
guess
i
felt
fairly
fortunate
that
i
was
able
to
do
that

and
i
did
notice
the
difference
between
those
of
infants
being
placed
in
daycare

and
i
thought
to
myself
how
can
a
mother
place
her
child
at
the
age
of
six
weeks
or
four
weeks
or
two
weeks
or
three
weeks

whatever
the
employer
says
you
have
to
be
back
at
work
is
basically
when
you
have
to
be
back
at
work
whether
it
be
six
weeks
or
three
or
four

but
how
these
women
must
feel
to
place
their
children
into
care

and
you
know
it
's
our
society
saying
yes

this
uh
you
need
this
job

it
's
a
little
bit
financial
type
thing

because
uh
if
you
look
all
over
in
the
other
countries
like
europe
and
that
uh
their
standards
of
living
are
a
lot
less
than
what
ours
are

and
that
's
part
of
it
too

but
uh
like
my
husband
was
saying
maybe
some
of
the
problems
we
brought
on
to
ourselves
is
that
these
women
back
in
the
nineteen
fifties
uh
were
staying
at
home
with
their
kids
and
then
made
the
decision
well
jeez
you
know
i
'll
go
out
and
get
a
part-time
job

got
a
part-time
job

and
then
financially
they
got
themselves
into
well
i
'll
have
the
boat

i
'll
have
the
car

and
it
's
nice

and
really
women
past
generation
women
have
done
it
to
women
of
this
day
and
age
too
uh

because
it
is
now
our
financial
situations
are
as
it
almost
takes
two
people
to
bring
in
an
income
to
support
a
family
now

and

uh-huh

sure

i
did
it
for
three
years

and
uh
it
cost
us
a
lot
of
financial
problems
doing
it

and
pretty
soon
you
know
you
're
at
the
limit
where
you
've
got
to
say
okay
you
've
sacrificed
for
you
know
so
many
years
at
home

and
you
're
not
getting
any
further
you
know
along

and
you
have
to
make
that
decision
to
go
back
to
work
part-time
or
go
back
to
work
full-time

and
you
have
to
make
that
decision

and
it
's
a
tough
one

and
i

uh-huh

sure

i
agree

yeah

i
know
that
i
have
three
children

and
uh
i
stay
home

i
do
n't
work

and
uh
i
know
that
it
it
must
be
really
challenging
to
uh
try
to
juggle
a
job
and
and
also
your
children

because
i
know
my
husband
if
i
were
gone
as
much
as
he
is
we
would
n't
have
the
influence
on
them
that
i
would
want
to
put
on
them

and
i
also
notice
that
the
children
that
come
over
here
to
play
that
go
to
daycare
every
day
they
do
n't
like
to
be
around
adults

they
do
n't
want
to
play
around
adults

they
do
n't
want
to
be
around
you

they
do
n't
want
you
to
tell
them
what
to
do

they
want
to
do
their
own
thing

and
they
're
the
very
same
age
as
my
children

and
i
'm
finding
as
i
volunteer
up
at
the
school
i
just
being
uh

i
'm
not
educated
at
all
in
uh
really
detecting
this

but
i
can
talk
to
the
teacher
and
tell
them
on
a
pretty
good
basis
after
i
've
worked
up
at
the
school
for
a
couple
of
weeks
which
kids
go
to
daycare
and
which
kids
stay
home

and
you
can
just
tell
in
their
personalities
and
how
they
respond
to
the
adults
that
uh
the
ones
that
are
are
home
and
the
ones
even
that
are
at
home
that
are
getting
the
love
and
attention
that
they
need

not
that
the
kids
that
go
out
are
n't
getting
that

it
's
just
a
different

they
're
they
are
more
use
to
being
with
their
own
age
kids

they
're
not
use
to
being
with
adults
and
to
responding
to
adults

uh
i
think
the
trend
in
the
united
states

i
feel
really
bad
that
it
's
turned
so
much
to
where
the
children
are
uh

right

right

it
's
hard

it
really
is
hard

i
know
that
my
husband
and
i
have
to
do
a
lot
of
sacrificing
to
keep
me
home

and
uh

right

right

i
think
one
of
the
things
that
people
look
at
too
though
is
uh
spen-
how
they
spend
their
time
with
their
children

i
think
with
working
moms
if
you
can
get
them
ma-
the
bosses
to
give
you
almost
like
a
rotation
like
they
're
going
to
do
with
year-round
school
where
you
work

okay

go
ahead

oh

sure

uh-huh

oh
you
're
kidding

yeah

huh

uh-huh

sure

oh
that
's
good
because
sometimes
i
wonder
you
know
being
a
uh
lay
person
out
there
of
not
uh
knowing
e-
exactly
what
's
going
on
in
space
whether
you
know
they
're
going
ahead
and
doing
things
and
whether
or
not

we
're
spending
too
much
money
on
the
programs
and
not
spending
enough
money
on
the
earth
that
we
have
here

being
you
know

to
me
all
this
uh
space
exploration
that
we
've
done
thus
far
has
told
us
that
there
's
no
other
place
like
earth
that
uh
we
ca
n't
live
on
mars

we
ca
n't
live
here

we
ca
n't
live
there

i
mean
this
is
the
the
place
that
we
have
to
live

i
mean
there
's
uh
no
other
resource
for
us
to
to
look
at
other
than
here

so
it
's
kind
of
like
to
me

i
would
like
to
see
a
lot
more
money
being
put
toward
taking
care
of
the
environment
that
we
have
here
and
not
so
much
emphasis
put
on
what
's
going
out
in
space

and
what
you
know

not
that
i
want
everything
to
halt

and
let
's
forget
about
the
space
program
or
whatever

because
we
're
always
curious

and
we
always
need
to
know
more
things

but
uh
to
me
it
's
kind
of
like
let
's
try
and
clean
up
the
air
that
we
have
here

let
's
try
to
take
care
of
the
lakes
that
are
getting
polluted
and
the
other
things
that
are
going
on
here

mainly
because
uh

the
space
program
has
taught
us
that
there
is
no
other
place
for
us

i
mean
this
is
it

i
mean
if
we
would
have
uh
if
we
would
have
went
into
space
and
found
mars
a
livable
uh
planet
we
probably
would
have
inhabited
it

and
uh
you
know
who
would
have
cared
about
earth

it
would
have
been
another
planet
to
kind
of
take
over
and
uh
continue
on

so
you
know
and
that

when
i
look
at
the
space
program
itself
i
think
of
it
you
know
as
being
in
terms
of
it
's
it
's
interesting
to
learn
but
it
's
also
it
's
it
brings
down
the
fact
that
this
earth
is
it

it
's
it
for
us
you
know
what
i
mean
uh
unless
technology
makes
the
decision
that
we
are
all
going
to
live
in
space
or
whatever

but
i
would
love
to
uh
go
into
the
space
shuttle
some
day
and
uh
just
see
uh
you
know
the
earth
and
the
different
planets
and
things
like
that

i
i
think
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
do
but
whether
it
would
be
feasible
to
do
i
do
n't
know

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

exactly

uh-huh

uh-huh

exactly

yeah

that
's
true
you
know

and
i
i
think
of
uh

i
'm
sure
you
probably
have
heard
of
the
genesis
program
that
's
going
on
currently
out
in
the
arizona
desert

uh
there
's
uh
you
know
they
're
trying
to
look
at
how
things
effect
everything
in
trying
to
create
you
know
an
environment
where
they
have
an
ocean
and
they
have
the
lakes
and
then
they
have
the
desert
part
of
it

and
then
they
have
an
area
that
's
more
uh
you
know
full
of
uh
vegetation
tropicals
that
kind
of
thing
to
kind
of
look
at
things
and
say
you
know
the
environment
wise
this
is
where
we
're
living

but
what
what
effects
it

and
how
can
we
improve
it
and
things
like
that

and
i
i
think
in
space
uh

i
do
n't
know
how
many
people
could
live
up
in
space
uh
for
any
length
of
time

i
mean
just
the
way
that
we
're
affected
by
when
it
's
cloudy
out

and
it
's
cloudy
for
days

and
we
do
n't
see
the
sun

and
the
people
their
moods
are
extreme
you
know

it
's
like
god
if
i
do
n't
get
to
see
the
sun
i
'm
going
to
be
in
this
bad
mood
all
this
entire
time

and
this
is
how
i
see
people
reacting

you
know
when
is
the
sun
going
to
come
out

so
i
wonder
how
you
know
somebody
living
up
in
space
is
going
to
be
able
to
tolerate
never
seeing
the
sun
you
know
in
the
aspect
that
we
see
it
uh
and
never
seeing
uh
you
know
light
bright
days
you
know

and

well
uh
a
friend
of
mine
actually
works
for
mcdonald
douglas
in
the
uh
in
the
space
station
program

so
i
get
to
find
out
a
lot
of
information
about
what
's
going
on
there

and
it
sure
sounds
like
that
's
going
to
be
a
really
viable
program
if
it
continues
to
be
funded
at
current
levels

uh
they
're
they
're
going
to
be
doing
a
lot
of
interesting
things

uh
i
think
one
of
the
big
things
he
's
involved
with
is
the
micro
gravity
payloads

and
that
has
a
direct
impact
on
a
lot
of
things
that
we
really
ca
n't
do
down
here
on
earth
including
uh
some
new
pharmaceutical
techniques

so
you
know
there
's
there
's
a
big
opportunity
for
us
to
explore
uh
what
sorts
of
things
you
can
do
in
a
zero
gravity
environment

so
i
suspect
that
we
'll
see
a
lot
of
gains
from
that

right

well
uh
as
far
as
the
practical
aspects
go
i
suspect
that
the
space
station
may
actually
be
a
good
compromise
between
you
know
deep
space
i
'm
sorry
deep
space
exploration
and
uh
and
not
doing
anything
because
we
have
the
opportunity
to
off
load
some
things
to
the
space
station

and
uh
you
know
perhaps
we
can
find
better
techniques
for
doing
things
that
uh
we
'd
normally
do
down
here
that
are
damaging
to
the
environment

uh-huh

right

right

uh
i
do
n't
know

my
personal
perception
of
government
and
uh
the
way
things
are
at
this
current
time
is
that
nobody
can
really
be
trusted

and
i
do
n't
feel
that
too
many
of
the
candidates
are
out
there
to
uh
be
self-serving
to
the
community

i
think
that
they
have
their
own
uh
wishes
to
uh
be
in
the
limelight
and
to
kind
of
say
hey
you
know
i
'm
a
public
official
i
do
n't
have
to
do
uh
certain
things

and
they
just
stand
out
more
involving
themselves
more
and
more
with
politics

but
it
's
really

after
all
the
things
that
i
've
seen
in
the
last
ten
years
about
government
and
now
the
overdrafts
uh
of
checks
uh
before
that
it
was
the
wonderful
uh
escapade
that
they
had
with
uh
the
new
uh
oh
god
chief
of
uh

well
supreme
court

i
'm
trying
to
think
of
his
name
and
uh
what
they
put
uh
him
through
in
regards
to

yeah

thomas

the
sex
sexual
harassment
that
kind
of
thing
and
just
to
see
our
government
react
to
that
and
then
just
little
things
that
have
added
up
where
people
have
taken
vacations
on
taxpayers'
monies
and
things
like
that

i
i
just
think
it
's
very
corrupt
and
whether
or
not
they
need
to
start
with
people
that
are
extremely
poor
and
send
them
into
government
versus
people
that
are
rich

but
it
's
always
the
rich
person
that
gets
into
government
that
has
the
money
to
advertise
the
money
to
d-
to
do
this

there
's
no
more
abe
abraham
lincolns
out
there
uh
that
can
get
into
government
even
if
they
were
poor

so
i
know
that
's
my
personal
viewpoint
of
things

now
they
just
uh
they
've
already
put
through
the
health
bill

yes

it
just
went
through

and
it
was
passed

and
that
is
going
to
be
a
heavier
tax
burden
on
a
lot
of
the
taxpla-
taxpayers
and
a
little
bit
more
on
to
the
medical

uh
i
do
n't
know
if
that
was
done
out
of
just
let
's
be
the
first
state
to
do
it
or
if
it
was
done
really
for
the
needs
of
the
people

you
know
what
i
'm
saying

it
it
's

right
now
every
little
state
around
here
is
thinking
about
oh
we
need
to
reform
the
health
uh
system

and
of
course
they
think
uh
wisconsin
our
neigh-
or
minnesota
our
neighbor
passed
a
state
law
the
health
bill

and
it
's
kind
of
like
we
're
the
first
to
do
it

so
i
do
n't
know
if
it
's
done
because
we
're
we
want
to
be
standing
out
as
being
innovative
in
the
health
system
or
whether
it
was
done
for
uh
you
know
a
real
good
purpose
to
help
people
that
ca
n't
afford
uh
health
insurance
that
kind
of
thing

uh-huh

oh
sure

oh
sure

uh-huh

it
it
sure
does

and
i
think
it
it
is
reflecting

like
you
said
i
think
society
as
a
whole
uh
you
ca
n't
expect
uh

when
we
have
t
v
-s
and
we
have
things
that
are
kind
of
bombarded
at
us
for
uh
you
know
immorality
and
this
and
this
and
this
that
we
can
expect
somebody
to
come
off
that
's
going
to
be
clean
totally
clean
and
come
into
government

uh
but
down
the
line
it
does
hurt

i
mean
when
somebody
's
corrupt
and
somebody
's
doing
something
it
's
uh
you
know
it
does
hurt
t-
each
individual
of
the
society
when
you
find
out
that
somebody
's
done
something
or
the
overdraft
policy
or
you
know
the
other
things
that
have
occurred

so
uh

uh-huh

exactly

yeah

well
that
's
exactly
what
happens
in
government
all
the
time

they
blow
the
whistle
on
each
other

oh
i
hear
that
you
're
doing
this

i
've
done
it

but
oh
boy

and
it
's
not
going
to
get
out

ex-

yeah

e-
exactly
it
's
uh

there
's
no
secrets
in
the
government
uh
i
do
n't
think
anymore

uh-huh

uh-huh

uh-huh

sure

uh-huh

uh-huh

oh
sure

i
think
i
i
do
n't
think
uh

thomas

uh-huh

does
n't
wisconsin
have
a
uh
state
uh
medicare
program
or
health
program

right

well
i
i
think
the
one
of
the
biggest
problems
that
uh
we
see
in
government
today
is
a
reflection
of
society
in
and
of
itself

and
that
is
uh
uh
we
become
so
debt
ridden
and
credit
oriented
instead
of
uh
cash
and
carry
or
debt
free

and
therefore
uh
that
puts
a
lot
of
undue
pressure
on
municipalities
state
and
federal
governments

right

well
what
is

see
the
thing
is
is
when
a
lot
of
things
become
acceptable
practice
uh
it
's
hard
to
discern
the
bor-
what
has
become
muddy
as
to
what
is
ethical
and
what
is
not
ethical

and
then
someone
blows
the
whistle
and
says
oh
this
is
not
ethical
and
yes
i
did
it
too

yeah

we
just
had

uh

right

the
mayor
of
dallas
is
uh
bartlett
steve
bartlett

he
also
uh
was
a
congressman
uh
to
the
uh
to
congress

and
he
had
been
in
that
position
for
years

and
uh
he
was
elected
mayor
of
dallas
overwhelmingly

however
if
the
vote
was
taken
today
the
whole
thing
might
change
because
he
was
part
of
that
uh
check
kiting
scam

what
do
you
usually
wear
to

uh-huh

oh
i
see

uh-huh

well
that
's
nice
comfortable
stuff

wow

wow

that
's
nice

well
actually
right
now
i
'm
a
full
time
college
student

so
my
dress
code
is
very
very

yeah

i
usually
wear
jeans
and
stuff
to
classes
or
shorts
in
the
summertime

but
over
the
summers
i
've
had
a
job
internships
with
the
newspaper

and
that
's
so

generally
then
i
dress
you
know
nicer

usually
nice
summer
slacks
or
more
sometimes
skirts
stuff
like
that

so
then
it
's
still
you
know
the
emphasis
is
on
comfort
a
lot
because
it
's
a
lot
of
walking
and
coming
in
out
of
the
office

but
you
still
have
to
have
a
professional
imagine
kind
of
thing
to
go
out
to
meet
people
and
interview
people
and
stuff
like
that

so

oh
really

uh-huh

wow

that
must
be
nice
atmosphere
then

oh

uh-huh

wow

that
's
interesting

it
's
like
a
mini
little
study
there

that
's
really
interesting

right

huh

that
's
interesting

uh-huh

that
's
neat

that
's
neat

uh-huh

oh

uh-huh

oh
well
that
's
nice

that
's
good
for
the
clothes
budget
i
would
imagine

because
here
gosh
we
had
uh

the
winter
has
n't
been
bad
this
winter

it
's
it
it
's
only
snowed
maybe
once
or
twice

but
it
's
been
cold

low
twenties
let
's
say

and
then
the
summer
gets
up
to
eighties
nineties

so

well
let
's
see

it
turns
out
that
uh
tek-

i
work
at
tektronix

and
it
's
a
very
uh
low
key
place
as
far
as
dress
goes

you
just
wear
uh

let
's
see

when
i
first
came
here
i
wore
suits

but
after
a
while
i
got
uh
found
out
that
that
was
n't
all
that
important

i
'm
an
engineer

and
uh
so
i
get
to
wear
just
uh
how
shall
i
say
it
uh
walking
shoes
as
opposed
to
dress
shoes
and
well
walking
how
shall
i
say
it
kind
of
like
avia
uh
walking
shoes
uh

yes

open
shirt
open
at
the
neck
you
know
no
tie

and
uh
just
uh
reasonable
looking
how
shall
i
say
it
uh
sports
clothes
or
some
guys
wear
some
people
even
wear
levis

now
being
from
philadelphia
i
do
n't
expect
your
dress
code
to
be
quite
that
relaxed
right

oh
okay

uh-huh

yes

yeah

well
i
uh
i
just
recently
applied
for
a
different
job
in
the
company
here

and
so
i
decided
well
i
'd
wear
a
suit

and
it
it
was
very
interesting

uh
like
i
said
most
of
the
people
at
at
this
company
do
n't
wear
suits

uh
most
of
the
engineers
and
technical
people
are
just
very
casual
almost
the
same
clothes
that
that
you
'd
wear
to
school

well
it
has
been

although
the
new
president
and
c
e
o
of
the
company
is
from
a
much
more
formal
eastern
uh
background

and
so
the
result
is
that
uh

so
anyway
i
wore
this
suit

and
i
went
over
to
uh
uh
to
one
of
the
buildings
that
has
a
lot
more
of
the
financial
people
in
it

and
it
and
i
i
was
almost
converted
because
uh
the
effect
of
that
suit
on
the
way
people
res-
reacted
and
responded
to
me
as
opposed
to
the

uh
just
to
kind
of

how
shall
i
say
it

they
know
you
're
there

but
they
do
n't

uh
you
do
n't

there
's
no
notice
at
all

but
when
i
wore
a
suit
that
day
uh
it
was
obvious
that
people
did
n't
know
whether
i
was
a
worker
bee
or
a
manager

so
people
uh
how
shall
i
say
it
made
a
made
much
more
effort
to
notice
you
acknowledge
your
presence
say
hello
and
uh
things
like
that

so

yeah

and
so
this
dress
for
success
thing
i
think
is
uh

by
and
large
i
've
i
'm
kind
of
uh
convinced
that
uh
by
that
just
that
one
uh
uh
experience
and
then
having
talked
to
several
other
people
that
that
uh
unless
you
're
in
a
an
environment
where
they
're
going
to
make
fun
of
of
of
better
clothes
that
better
clothes
always
pay
off

does
n't
mean
they
have
to
be
uh

how
shall
i
say
it

th-
they
do
n't
have
to
be
the
the
most
uh
the
absolute
best

but
uh
a
little
dressing
a
little
bit
above
the
standard
i
think
would
uh
pay
off

so
i
'm
in
the
process
of
telling
my
wife
we
got
to
go
shopping
for
clothes
again

and
uh
i
i
do
n't
know

now
i
i
know
eastern

now
the
other
thing
we
do
here
of
course
is
a
single
not
quite
a
single
climate

we
have
uh
we
do
have
some
snow
in
the
wintertime

and
it
can
be
quite
warm
in
the
summertime

not
hot
like
uh

i
lived
in
the
midwest
for
a
while

and
i
know
that
uh
you
know
it
can
be
freezing
cold
in
the
wintertime
and
hot
and
uh
sticky
in
the
summertime

we
do
n't
have
that
much

it
's
uh
it
's
a
very
mild
climate

yes

it
is

you
interested
in
woodworking

um
what
kind
of

pine

uh-huh

i
guess
he
's
young

oh
he
'll
be
delighted

did
you
do
it
with
a
jigsaw

or
do
you
have
powered
you
know
a

um

well
i
'm
i
am
interested
in
woodworking

i
do
n't
have
lots
of
tools

our
local
schools
have
adult
education
in
the
evening

uh
and
i
use
their
tools
m-
a-
an-
and
some
of
their
guidance

i
'm
an
artist

and
i
'm
very
handy

and
you
know
if
i
touch
it
it
turns
into
something
us-
usually

i
'm
uh
well
actually
i
'm
very
you
know

i
have
a
master
's
degree

and
and
my
projects
had
to
do
with
acrylic
painting

but
i
'm
really
interested
in
the
crafts

i
make
stain
glass

i
've
done
some
silver
jewelry
making

and
i
kind
of

once
i
get
so-
you
know
really
pretty
good
at
something
i
want
to
try
something
else

yeah

well
no

actually
i
get
good
enough
to
sell
it
or
have
people
say
oh
wow

you
did
n't
buy
it

you
made
it

and
then
i
it
's
like
well
the
thrill
is
gone

so
let
's
do
something
else

well
yeah

i
i
'm
signed
up
for
a
class
in
pottery
making
because
i
've
never
tried
that
yet

but

well
i
i
actually
have
a
masters
of
art

and
it
's
in
art
education

so
i
'm
a
licensed
teacher

but
jobs
being
what
they
are
i
substitute
teach

and
that
way
i
have
time
for
my
kids
too

and
i
've
been
fortunate
that
i
can
afford
to
work
part-time

i
do
n't
know
how
long
that
's
going
to
last

and
uh
they
're
cutting
back

so
i
do
n't
go
in
all
that
often

but
i
've
been
real
interested
in
some
of
those
cute
country
country
kind
of
things

uh
i
see
stuff
in
craft
galleries
for
five
hundred
dollars

and
i
say
oh
no

and
and
i
go

and
i
make
it

that
's
how
i
started
jewelry
making

i
i
love
to
cook

and
i
saw
a
silver
necklace
that
had
these
little
teeny
weeny
silver
spatulas
and
and
and
knife
and
and
a
fork
and
all
kinds
of
stuff

and
i
went

and
i
signed
up
for
class
because
then
again
you
get
you
know
get
someone
to
guide
you

and
you
get
the
tools
you
do
n't
feel
like
buying

and
i
made
a
necklace
that
i
saw
in
a
gallery
for
three
hundred
twenty
dollars

it
took
me
a
lot
of
time

but
it
did
n't

but
if
it
cost
me
twenty
dollars
you
know

and
then
i

yeah

then
i
saw
a
one
of
these
country
looking
wood
watermelons

it
was
a
solid
watermelon
with
a
wedge
cut
out
of
it

oh
yeah

uh-huh

i
went
there

we
have
home
depot
out
here

i
do
n't
know
if
you
've
heard
of
it

i
went

and
i
got
two
six
foot
inch
thick
boards
turned
into
a
watermelon

i
had
to
cut
into
slabs
and
build
up
this
big
square
and
turn
it
on
the
lath

and
cutting
that
wedge
out
was
no
joke

we
did
it
on
a
i
had
a
uh
i
did
it
through
adult
ed
again

i
did
it
through
adult
ed
again

and
the
teacher
was
one
of
these
negative
people

oh
that
's
dangerous

we
ca
n't
do
that

we
just
ca
n't
do
that

and
i
'm
going
well
how
about
this
way

i
i
want
to
do
that

that
was
the
plan
here

so
we
did
get
the
wedge
cut
out
by
building
some
kind
of
a
cradle
for
it

well
it
the
instructions
in
the
book
i
had
said
use
a
coping
saw

but
there
's
no
coping
saw
big
enough
to
for
a
fourteen
inch
wide
watermelon
that

and
he
wanted
me
to
do
it
by
hand
with
a
regular
saw

i
said
i
'm
not
that
steady

it
's
not
going
to
happen

so
we
built
a
cradle
for
it

and
we
got
th-
once
it
was
turned
we
got
one
s-
one
cut
out
on
the
table
saw
on
the
radial
saw

by
getting
the
other
one
out
without
the
slice
now
flying
in
your
face
was
something
you
had
to
think
about

so

uh
i
'd
say
it
's
about
an
eighth

you
know
jus-

yeah

actually
i
uh
i
guess
i
am

um
it
just
seems
kind
of
funny
that
this
is
a
topic
of
discussion

uh
i
do
uh
some
uh
woodworking
myself

uh
in
fact
i
'm
in
the
middle
of
a
project
right
now
making
a
bed
for
my
son

it
's
uh
it
's
uh
it
's
uh
plywood
uh
face
i
guess

but
i
cut
it
out
in
the
shape
of
a
crayon
box

and
then
i
painted
uh
about
eight
different
uh
colors
uh
you
know

the
crayons
that
are
sticking
up
it
will
be
the
headboard

and
then

yes

he
's
about
five
and
a
half
years
old

oh
yeah

uh-huh

now
i
just
have
to
finish
it
though

i
got
uh
it
got
delayed
for
a
little
bit
and
uh
because
of
work

and
now
uh
i
've
got
to
jump
back
in
and
finish
the

because
i
've
got
it
all
cut
out

it
's
all
uh

i
've
done
most
of
the
coloring

but
i
've
got
to
go
a
second
layer
with
the
yellow

uh
yeah

uh
i
did
uh
jigsaw
uh
and
the
uh
regular
straight
saw
for
some
of
it

so
yeah

to
do
the
uh
th-
the
turn
cut

uh
how
about
yourself

oh

oh
okay

that
's
great

what
what
type
of
art
do
you
focus
on

huh

yeah

kind
of
jack
of
all
trades
master
of
none

that
's
great

right

you
want
to
uh
e-
explore
a
new
field

or
or

huh
so
you
have
a
m
f
a
in
in
what
division
of
art

oh
okay

yeah

oh
yeah

huh
yeah

yeah

oh
that
's
great

huh
yeah

exactly

oh
yeah

and
your
time

then
you
're
that
much
farther
ahead

right

i
've
seen
them

and
then
the
watermelon
the
red
with
the
with
the
seeds
painted
in

and

that
's
neat

yes

we
have
one

huh

oh
i
'm
i
'm
sure

a
band
saw

what

uh-huh

right

a
cradle
for
it

yeah

so
you
can
steady
it

and
then
you
used
a
handsaw
or
a
backsaw

right

right

yeah

right

now
did
you
cut
a
quarter
wedge
in
this

well
i
i
'm
envisioning
uh
uh
a
water-
a
watermelon
like
a
log

and
then
uh
what
i
've
seen
of
this
kind
before
is
you
have
the
uh
the
uh

it
's
uh

if
you
're
looking
at
adding
on
you
have

up
here
in
rochester
uh
we
're
the
second
cleanest
metropolitan
city
as
far
as
air
pollution

i
think
grand
rapids
was
number
one

uh
we
really
do
n't
have
too
much
of
a
problem
as
far
as
uh
industry
since
we
're
pretty
technologically
based
as
far
as
our
industry
in
the
city
here

but
we
do
have
the
same
problem
a
lot
of
ar-
other
areas
up
here
in
the
northeast
have

and
that
is
the
effects
of
acid
rain
com-
coming
basically
from
coal
plants
in
ohio
and
illinois
and
indiana

yeah

i
've
i
've
uh
was
in
los
angeles
once

and
that
was
quite
a
difference
as
far
as
pollution
goes

i
mean
you
could
n't
really
see
that
much

every
once
in
a
while
we
have
these
air
inversions
the
weather
inversions

and
then
it
gets
hazy
around
here

but
they
're
really

we
do
n't
have
a
big
problem
with
it

i
think
that
uh
what
most
of
the
people
here
in
new
york
state
are
going
after
right
now
is

it
's
it
's
the
uh
ongoing
acid
rain
problem

especially
out
in
the
uh
uh
adirondack
areas
where
you
know
the
lakes
are
becoming
uh
changing
the
acidity
of
the
lakes

and
we
're
having
problems
now
because
the
fish
are
dying
and
certain
acidic
loving
plants
uh
or
alkaline
liking
plants
are
j-
not
lasting
anymore
because
the
soil
levels
the
p
h
is
changing
as
this
acid
rain
continues
to
fall

and
i
know
that
there
's
been
battles
over
the
states
up
here

uh
you
know
governor
mario
going
after
you
know
governors
of
ohio
and
il-
and
indiana
to
fix
what
's
going
on
down
there

i
remember
when
i
was
in
florida

the
only
problem
was
that
it
seemed
like
it
may

it
was
n't
really
pollution
just
the
steamy
weather

yeah

it

oh
yeah

i
you
know
i
was
in
boston
once

and
i
remembered
seeing
some
of
these
things
coming
through
at
rush
hour
even
with
the
tee

uh
just
this
it
looked
like
billions
of
cars
massing

and
if
they
sit
there
and
then
there
's
nowhere
for
the
air
to
go

i
mean
yeah
that
's
what
's
in
you
know
los
angeles
is

i
think
that
's
biggest
problem

because
when
i
was
in
los
angeles
for
a
time
it
's
all
you
know
from
los
angeles
to
san
diego
it
's
like
all
city

and
there
's
really
there
's
nowhere
for
this
to
be
absorbed
really

uh
tree
planting
sometimes
can
handle
you
know
stopping
some
of
the
air
pollution
and
that
and
help

but
if
you
have
nowhere
to
do
anything

yeah

i
you
know
florida
does
n't
seem
to
be
at
least
maybe
miami

but
i
i
uh
you
know

fort
lauderdale
i
i
do
n't
know
what
the
big
industries
are
down
there
uh

but
you
know
up
here
we
have
kodak

and
that
's
the
worst
polluter

they
put
uh
uh

you
can
smell
ether
in
the
air
sometimes

it
keeps
the
neighborhoods
happy
i
guess

uh
cause
they
clean
the
uh
the
lenses
for
cameras

and
they
they
make
film
here

and
they
're
the
worst
offender

but
it
's
you
know
it
's
under
so
much
control

you
know
sulphur
dioxide
is
the
big
emittant
from
them

but
that
's
really
getting
under
control
now

be
interesting
to
see
when
as
mexico
develops
industrially
whether
you
know
without

right

well
tha-
that
's
true

actually
down
here
we
do
n't
have
a
big
problem
with
uh
with
air
pollution

mainly
because
we
do
n't
have
anybody
to
th-
to
either
side
of
us

uh
which
helps
out
a
lot
as
far
as
that
goes

i
would
n't
even
necessarily
thought
of
that
except
when
i
lived
up
in
boston
and
up
in
uh
you
know

debates
would
come
up
up
there
in
massachusetts
and
you
know
in
that
area
over
uh
air
pollution

and
their
attitude
's
basically
well
prevailing
ins
winds
are
to
the
east

so
why
should
we
have
to
worry

oh
yes

nothing

right

oh
absolutely

yeah

just
muggy

so
yes

i
think

yeah

i
think
you
're
right

our
most
pollute
substance
down
here
is
just
water

but
i
i
i
i
think
you
know
the
biggest
causes
even
then
a
lot
of
times
are
uh
uh
like
when
i
was
up
in
boston
just
all
the
cars
you
know
just
all
over
the
place

you
just
got
a
lot
of
you
know
a
lot
of
pollution
from
those

and
uh
you
know
if
you
do
n't
have
a
wind
it
sticks
around

absolutely

right

that
's
that
's
very
true

uh
you
know
of
course
then
when
when
you
're
not
recycling
you
've
got
these
incendiary
plants
and
stuff
that
can
give
you
some
pretty
disgusting
stuff
going
up
in
the
atmosphere

but
i
you
know
you
've
got
you
've
got
the
industry

you
've
got
that

and
you
got
the
cars

i
think
the
cars
are
where
where
it
's
at
right
now
as
far
as
pollution
goes
air
pollution
i
mean

right

i
guess
so

right

i
you
know
i
do
n't
know
in
the
air
what
they
do

uh
i
i
have
n't
run
across
any
major
pollutants
down
there
that
i
've
i
've
really
seen
a
lot
of
you
know
upsettedness
about

uh
i
i
know
i
've
seen
like
uh

my
grandparents
live
in
corpus
christi
texas

and
i
know
they
've
there
's
a
lot
of
refineries
down
there

and
that
that
's
some
pretty
potent
stuff
they
put
up
in
the
air

i
but
i
do
n't
know
how
uh
you
know

there
's
a
difference
in
what
you
can
smell
and
what
you
uh
you
know
what
's
bad
