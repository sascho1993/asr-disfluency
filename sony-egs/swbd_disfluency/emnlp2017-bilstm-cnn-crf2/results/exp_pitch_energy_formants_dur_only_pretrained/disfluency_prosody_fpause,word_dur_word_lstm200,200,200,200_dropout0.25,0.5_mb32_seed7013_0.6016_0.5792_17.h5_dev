a	O

both	O
my	O

and	O
i	O
uh	O
grew	O
up	O
in	O
uh	O
families	O
of	O
rather	O
modest	O

and	O
uh	O
our	O
family	O
income	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
is	O
comfortable	O
upper	O
middle	O
class	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
might	O
say	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
're	O
both	O
so	O
uh	O
frugal	O
that	O
um	O
we	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
a	O
budget	O
you	O
know	O

we	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O
invest	O
the	O
money	O
and	O
go	O
on	O
vacations	O
and	O
always	O
never	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
any	O

problems	O
which	O
i	O

is	O
a	O
comfortable	O
thing	O

well	O
we	O
stay	O
within	O
our	O
means	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
uh	O
by	O
conscious	O
effort	O

it	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O
happens	O
automatically	O

although	O
we	O
just	O
moved	O
to	O
california	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
living	O
here	O
in	O
california	O
is	O
um	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
rather	O
pathological	O

uh	O
housing	O
prices	O
are	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
from	O
four	O
to	O
ten	O
times	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
um	O
um	O
they	O
were	O
where	O
i	O
came	O
from	O
in	O
uh	O
dallas	O

yeah	O

so	O
uh	O
uh	O
that	O
presents	O
um	O
a	O
real	O
shock	O

actu-	O
actually	O
our	O
standard	O
of	O
living	O
has	O
gone	O
down	O
somewhat	O
since	O
we	O
've	O
moved	O
to	O
california	O

but	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
god	O
's	O
country	O

uh	O
and	O
one	O
way	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
is	BE_IP
that	C
only	O
god	O
can	O
afford	O
it	O

um	O
so	O
budget	O
is	O
not	O
a	O

for	O
us	O

uh	O

it	O
has	O
n't	O
been	O

it	BE
may	IP
it	C
may	C

at	O

but	O
uh	O
up	O
until	O
this	O

it	O
really	O
has	O
n't	O

when	BE
i	IP
uh	C
was	C
in	C
uh	O
undergraduate	O
school	O
a	O
long	O
long	O
time	O
ago	O
i	O
uh	O
noted	O
that	O
the	O
monthly	O
salary	O
starting	O
average	O
monthly	O
salary	O
salary	O
for	O
engineers	O
that	O
in	O
my	O

was	O

oh	O
six	O
hundred	O
and	O
ten	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
noted	O
at	O
that	O
point	O
that	O
i	BE
was	IP
you	C
know	C
if	C
that	C
's	C
what	C
my	C
salary	O
was	O
that	O
i	O
drew	O
then	O
i	O
would	O
be	O
making	O
almost	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
my	O
father	O
made	O
during	O
his	O
best	O

ever	O

so	O
i	O
stopped	O
worrying	O
about	O
money	O

and	O
uh	O

never	O
have	O
worried	O
about	O
money	O
since	O
then	O

sometimes	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
problem	O
you	O
know	O
because	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
manage	O
my	O
money	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
should	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
suppose	O
i	O
've	O
lost	O
money	O
on	O
not	O
taking	O
good	O
advantage	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
uh	O
investments	O

but	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
both	O
lucky	O
in	O
that	O
regard	O
then	O

uh	O
how	O
big	O
is	O
your	O
family	O

i	O
see	O

so	O
how	O

do	O
you	O
and	O
when	BE_IP
once	C
you	C
get	C
ten	O
children	O
though	O
you	O
may	O
have	O

oh	O
all	O
right	O

i	O
have	O
two	O
kids	O

uh	O
one	O
nine	O
and	O
one	O
thirteen	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
are	C
beginning	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
budget	O
problem	O
but	O
uh	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
really	O
up	O
until	O
this	O
up	O
to	O
this	O
point	O

i	BE
give	IE
them	IP
uh	C
i	C
give	C
them	C
an	O
allowance	O

and	O
they	O
um	O

i	O
basically	O
give	O
my	O
son	O
ten	O
dollars	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
i	O
put	O
half	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
bank	O

and	O
i	O
give	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
other	O
half	O
in	O
cold	O
cash	O

and	O
uh	O
he	O
has	O
a	O
teller	O
card	O
so	O
he	BE
can	IP
uh	C
do	C
what	C
he	O
wi-	O
do	O
what	O
he	O
wishes	O
with	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
i	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
bank	O

but	O
at	O
least	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
burning	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
his	O
pocket	O

if	O
he	O
wants	O
to	O
use	O
it	O
he	O
has	O
to	O
go	O
get	O
it	O

and	O
that	O
usually	O

oh	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
start	O

okay	O

well	O
uh	O
we	O
keep	O
a	O
budget	O
to	O
an	O
extent	O

um	O
and	O
really	O
i-	O
i-	O
we	O
were	O
really	O
forced	O
into	O
keeping	O
a	O
budget	O
because	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
paid	O
once	O
a	O
month	O
which	O
sort	BE
of	IP
sort	C
of	C
forces	O
some	O
uh	O
uh	O
restrictions	O

and	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
all	O
your	O
bills	O
are	O
paid	O

uh	O
how	O
about	O
yourself	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
really	O
is	O
sort	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
keeping	O
a	O
budget	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
stay	O
within	O
your	O
uh	O
within	O
your	O
means	O

yeah	O

yes	O

oh	O
you	O
moved	O
from	O
dallas	O
to	O
san	O
francisco	O

that	O
is	O
a	O
huge	O
difference	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
have	O
good	O
sour	O
dough	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
beautiful	O
place	O
to	O
live	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

well	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
system	O
too	O

well	O
then	O
again	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
said	O
you	O
you	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
take	O
trips	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
obviously	O
have	O
enough	O
to	O
live	O
on	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
're	O
indirectly	O
budgeting	O
uh	O
just	O
by	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
you	O
said	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
both	O
very	O
frugal	O
uh	O
in	O
spending	O
the	O
money	O

so	O
i	O
mean	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
form	O
of	O
budgeting	O
i	O
would	O
think	O

it	O
's	O
kind	BE
of	IE
a	IP
kind	C
of	C
a	C
strange	O
topic	O
to	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
for	O
two	O
people	O
who	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
have	O
a	O
budget	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
budgeting	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
manage	O
their	O
money	O

yeah	O

uh	O
well	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
have	C
one	O
on	O
the	O
way	O

um	O
my	O
wife	O

and	O
then	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
having	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
in	BE_IP
uh	C
in	C
uh	O
september	O

no	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
one	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

oh	O

do	O
they	O
budget	O
at	O
all	O

i	O
mean	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
them	O
on	O
an	O
allowance	O

or	BE_IP
yeah	C

yeah	O

well	O
actually	O
uh	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
think	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
the	O
uh	O
uh	O
majority	O
of	BE_IP
in	C
in	O
texas	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
i	O
agree	O
with	O

no	O

uh	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
say	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
that	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
ago	O

when	O
i	O
was	O
younger	O
i	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
sign	O
of	O
a	O
civilized	O
society	O
if	O
you	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
uh	O
capital	O
punishment	O

but	O
um	O
uh	O
maybe	O
slowly	O
changing	O
my	O
opinion	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
thoroughly	O
opposed	O
to	O
it	O

i	O
still	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
true	O
that	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
more	O
civilized	O
society	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
use	O
capital	O
punishment	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
beginning	O
to	O
believe	O
this	O
is	O
less	O
civilized	O
society	O
than	O
i	O
thought	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
certainly	O
do	O
n't	O
uh	O
advocate	O
turning	O
people	O
like	O
that	O
loose	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
executing	O
them	O
uh	O
does	O
anymore	O
than	BE_IP
keeping	C
them	O
in	O
jail	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
factor	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O

the	O
cost	O
is	O
something	O

but	O
it	BE
's	IP
i	C
think	C
it	C
's	C
relatively	O
unimportant	O
compared	O
to	BE_IP
what	C
's	C
the	O
most	O
effective	O
way	O
of	O
dealing	O
with	O
crime	O

and	O
i	BE
guess	IP
uh	C
i	C
would	C
like	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

the	O
european	O
countries	O
certainly	O
uh	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
have	O
capital	O

and	O
they	BE
do	IE

a	IP
they	C

either	O

no	O

you	O

they	O

anybody	O

and	O
i	O

either	O

and	O
they	O

the	O

we	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
relationship	O
between	O
the	O
two	O

i	O
guess	O
what	O
worries	O
me	O
about	O
capital	O
punishment	O
is	BE_IP
uh	C
when	C
i	O
see	O
people	O
enthusiastic	O
about	O
it	O
and	O
uh	O
uh	O
sort	O
of	O
bloodthirsty	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
brings	O
out	O
the	O
worst	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
people	O
who	O
do	O
the	O
punishing	O

and	BE
the	IP
that	BE_IP
that	C
bothers	O
me	O

but	O
it	O

but	O
uh	O

hum	O

yeah	O

huh	O

well	O
actually	O
i	O
wha-	O

the	O
other	O
thing	O
that	O
bothers	O
me	O
is	O
when	O
it	O
becomes	O
a	O
political	O
issue	O
because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
think	O
it	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
s-	BE_IP
um	C
very	C
important	O
aspect	O
of	O
fighting	O
crime	O
or	O
law	O
and	O

or	O
anything	O
else	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
just	O
becomes	O
a	BE_IP
uh	C

i	C
'm	C
tougher	O
than	O
you	O
are	O
type	O
of	O
emotional	O

for	O

so	O
i	O
would	O

for	O
it	O
to	O
be	O

uh	O

uh	O
uh	O

i	O

i	O

there	O
's	O

for	O

in	O
the	O

now	O
i	BE

i	C

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C_IP
i	C
would	O

my	O

you	O
sound	O
a	O

a	O

of	O
mine	O
a	BE_IP
a	C

i	O

she	BE_IP
she	C

you	O

but	C
i	O

i	BE

i	C
would	C
rather	O
a	O

the	O

i	O

or	O
a	BE_IP
a	C

a	O

touch	O
my	O

i	O
still	O
feel	O
very	O

that	O

is	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	BE_IP
to	C

who	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
absolutely	O
no	O

for	BE_IP
what	C
they	O

and	O
we	O
see	O
that	O
more	O
and	O
more	O

like	O
in	O
our	O

right	O
now	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
fourteen	O

a	O
seven	O

you	O

what	O

when	O

an	O

no	O

it	O
does	O

it	O

they	O
're	O

it	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
pretty	O
heavy	O
state	O
compared	O
to	O
georgia	O

i	O
mean	O
you	O
guys	O
are	BE_IP
are	C_IP
a	C
lot	O
more	O
uh	O
for	O
to	O
each	O
his	O
own	O
even	O
than	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
georgia	O

but	O
even	O
in	O
georgia	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
attitude	O
for	O
the	O
most	O

if	O
i	O
work	O
and	O

my	O

you	O
work	O
and	O
pay	O
your	O

oh	O
really	O

yeah	O

you	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'd	C
hate	O
to	O
be	O
the	O

to	IP
pull	C
the	C

you	O

i	O
would	O
never	O
in	O
a	O
million	O

want	O
that	O
job	O
but	O
i	O
do	O
believe	O
it	O
's	O
necessary	O

and	O
i	O

on	O
the	O
one	O
hand	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
guess	O
i	O
admire	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
has	O
the	O
guts	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
because	O
i	BE
could	IP
n't	C
i	C
could	C
n't	O
stand	O
behind	O
a	O

and	O
shoot	O
somebody	O
for	O
nothing	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O

the	O

but	O
i	O

yeah	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

what	BE_IP
what	C
's	C
making	O
you	O
become	O
more	O
convinced	O
that	O
it	O
might	BE
be	IE
a	IP
good	C
way	C
of	C
punishing	O

yeah	O

oh	O
gosh	O

yeah	O
oh	O
yeah	O

if	BE_IP
it	C
ever	O
touched	O
my	O
fam-	O

i	O

you	O
know	O
actually	O
in	O
this	O
modern	O
day	O
and	O
age	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
uh	O
uh	O
we	O
have	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
leisure	O
time	O
because	O
uh	O
we	O
have	O
so	O
many	O
uh	O
convenience	O
appliances	O
and	O
whatnot	O

and	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
have	O
to	O
cook	O

anymore	O

uh	BE_IP
but	C
i	BE_IP
uh	C_IE
i	C_IE
've	C_IE
heard	C_IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
know	O
this	O
for	O
a	O
fact	O
but	O
i	O
've	O
heard	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
families	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
spend	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
together	O

that	BE_IP
ki-	C
the	O
kids	O
maybe	O
on	O
the	O
average	O
get	O
uh	O
something	O
like	O
thirty	O
seconds	O
of	O
quality	O
time	O
with	O
the	O
parents	O

it	O
seems	O
bizarre	O
to	O
me	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
quite	O
understand	O
it	O
although	O
i	O
think	O
probably	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
worst	O
thing	O
that	O
's	O
happening	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
modern	O
world	O
today	O
is	O
television	O

not	O
so	O
much	O
because	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
bad	O
per	O
se	O
although	O
there	O
is	O
some	O
pretty	O
crappy	O
programming	O

and	O
i	O
thin-	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
some	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
um	O
poorer	O
lifestyles	O
illustrated	O
but	O
simply	O
because	O
it	O
dominates	O
so	O
much	O
discussionary	O
time	O

it	O
's	O
so	O
darned	O
easy	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
thing	O
on	O

so	O
i	O
refuse	O
to	O
have	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
house	O

yeah	O

um	O

well	O
i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O

television	O
sure	O
makes	O
child	O
rearing	O
easy	O
on	O
you	O

i	O
mean	O
the	O
kids	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
real	O
pest	O
uh	O

and	O
turning	O
the	O
t._v.	O
on	O
is	O
almost	O
like	O
magic	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
uh	O
like	O
sticking	O
uh	O
an	O
electrode	O
into	O
their	O
pleasure	O
center	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
them	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
too	O
good	O

um	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
take	O
advantage	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
to	O
spend	O
with	O
the	O
kids	O

but	O
i	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
um	O
dinner	O
time	O

we	O
always	O
eat	O
together	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
whenever	O
you	BE
're	IP
with	C
your	C
kids	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
interact	O
with	O
them	O
rather	O
than	O
just	O
ignore	O
them	O

uh	O
i	O
guess	O
our	O
big	O
outlet	O
is	O
music	O
um	O
our	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
son	O
plays	O
violin	O

and	O
our	O
nine	O
year	O
old	O
daughter	O
plays	O
cello	O
and	O
uh	O
when	O
our	O
son	O
started	O
playing	O
violin	O
i	O
took	O
up	O
violin	O

and	O
when	O
our	O
daughter	O
started	O
playing	O
cello	O
i	O
took	O
up	O
cello	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
plenty	BE
of	IP
plenty	C
of	C
interactive	O
time	O
in	O
uh	O
practicing	O
although	O
neither	O
kid	O
likes	O
to	O
practice	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
big	O
surprise	O

but	O
i	BE
mea-	IP
i	C
imagine	C
with	O
infants	O
you	O
are	O
most	O
of	O
your	O
time	O
is	O
sort	O
of	O
spent	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
rather	O
than	O
interacting	O
with	O
them	O
although	O

y-	BE_IP
oh	C
you	O
know	O
reading	O
is	O
so	O
good	O

i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C
took	O
great	O

my	O

when	O
they	O
were	O

and	O
i	O
still	O

to	O
them	O
although	O
our	O

uh	O
but	O
i	O

you	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
've	O
put	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
emphasis	O
on	O
that	O
on	O
my	O

oh	O
i	O

or	O
two	O

my	O

so	O
she	O
's	O

a	O

and	O
so	O
i	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O

with	O
them	O

they	O
're	O
two	O
and	O
one	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

so	O
uh	O
what	O
things	O
do	O
you	O

an	O

oh	O
i	BE

i	O

they	BE_IP
they	C

that	BE

uh	O
uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
um	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O

a	O

should	O
be	O
more	O

by	O
you	O

and	O
if	BE_IP
they	C_IE

with	O
a	BE_IP
you	C

you	O

the	O

uh	C

yeah	O
that	BE

that	C

be	O

i	O

i	O

i	O

n't	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
what	O
about	O
the	O
required	O
drug	O
testing	O
uh	O
as	O
a	BE_IP
uh	C
condition	C
of	C
employment	O

it	O
a	O
subtle	O
thing	O
actually	O

um	O
i	O
uh	O
have	O
worked	O
at	O
texas	O
instruments	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O
instituted	O
a	O
drug	O
policy	O
there	O
drug	O
testing	O
policy	O
where	O
they	O
randomly	O
would	O
test	O
uh	O
employees	O
and	O
actually	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
truth	O
i	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
much	O
about	O
it	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
had	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
relate	O
to	O
me	O

but	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
things	O
that	O
people	O
brought	O
up	O
like	O
well	O
what	O
happens	O
if	O
they	O
they	O
get	O
a	O
false	O
positive	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
recourse	O
do	O
you	O
have	O

and	O
also	O
um	O
uh	O
this	O
is	O
against	O
the	O
law	O
for	O
the	O
government	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
big	O
brother	O
activity	O

and	O
yet	O
uh	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
these	O
large	O
corporations	O
such	O
as	O
texas	O
instruments	O
although	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
admit	O
to	O
it	O
it	O
's	O
actually	O
oh	O
a	O
drug	O
testing	O
policy	O
comes	O
about	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
government	O
pressure	O

so	O
what	O
that	O
means	O
is	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
really	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
government	O
that	O
's	O
requiring	O
this	O

although	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
actually	O
e-	O
execute	O
it	O
themselves	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
the	O
government	O
's	O
that	O

so	O
in	O
that	O
sense	O
a-	O
at	O
least	O
uh	O
philosophically	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
borderline	O
legal	O

well	O
what	O
about	O
this	O
uh	O
aids	O
epidemic	O
now	O

where	O
you	O
find	O
that	O
uh	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
certain	O
people	O
are	O
actually	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
criminal	O
in	O
their	O
disregard	O
for	O
others	O

yeah	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
uh	O
of	O
course	O
the	O
ultimate	O
solution	O
is	O
to	O
operate	O
on	O
their	O
brain	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O

get	O
uh	O
it	O
destroys	O
their	O
libido	O

now	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
ever	O

so	O
what	O
about	O
that	O
as	O
an	O
invasion	O
of	O
privacy	O

yeah	O
so	O
really	O

it	O
i-	O
gets	O
to	O
balancing	O
uh	O
personal	O
freedom	O
against	O
uh	O
the	O
general	O
welfare	O
of	O

well	O
are	O
it	O
's	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O

now	O

it	O

a	O
growing	O
part	O

um-hum	O

maybe	O
chop	BE_IP
their	C
weenies	O
off	O

uh	O
well	O
you	O
know	O
um	O
i	O
think	O
public	O
service	O
is	O
a	O
worthy	O
thing	O

and	O
as	O
a	O

of	O

there	O

a	O

that	O

that	O

probably	O
the	O
most	O

one	O
but	O
uh	O
one	O
that	BE_IP

not	O

is	O
the	O

in	O
which	O

the	O
key	O
element	O

i	BE_IP
um	C
i	C
think	O
the	O
question	O
is	O
posed	O
somewhat	O
strangely	O
because	O
um	O
it	O
's	O
talking	O
about	O
uh	O
a	O

for	O

uh	O
and	O
of	O

pea-	O
the	O

is	BE
a	IP
is	C
a	C
voluntary	O

uh	O

right	O

of	O
course	O
um	O
uh	O
military	O
service	O
falls	O
under	O
the	O
category	O
uh	O
of	BE_IP
a	C
public	O
service	O

and	O
so	O
uh	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	BE_IP
would	C
fulfill	O
the	BE_IP
at	C

the	O

set	O

in	O
the	O
charge	O
is	O
military	O
service	O
or	O

uh	O

but	O
i	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O
that	O
probably	O
is	O
not	O
what	O
was	O
comprehended	O

there	O
are	O
other	O
things	O
such	O
as	O
civil	O
service	O
um	O
which	BE_IP
many	C

uh	O
are	O

i	O
suspect	O
that	O
that	O

no	O

it	O

to	BE

you	O

well	O
we	O
're	O

you	O

really	O

it	O

n't	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
wrong	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
um	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
government	O
should	O
do	O
something	O
about	O
stopping	O
it	O
completely	O
about	O
it	O
coming	O
into	O
our	O
country	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
just	O
slap	O
somebody	O
's	O
little	O
hand	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
well	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
that	O
again	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
then	C
th-	BE_IP
y-	C_IP
you	C
know	C
they	C
'll	C
get	O
out	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
right	O
back	O
at	O
it	O
again	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

but	O
uh	O
other	O
than	O
that	O
why	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

like	O
i	O
say	O
maybe	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
days	O
i	O
'll	O
get	O
a	O
job	O
because	O
i	O
am	O
looking	O
still	O
for	O
a	O
part-time	O
job	O
you	O
know	O
since	O
my	O
company	O
went	O
bankrupt	O

and	O
i	O
'll	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
like	O
i	O
say	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
would	O
n't	O
care	O
because	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
do	IE
n't	IE
s-	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
even	C
smoke	O

so	O
they	O
can	O
test	O
me	O
all	O
i	O
want	O

i	O
wonder	O
what	O
if	O
you	O
take	O
medicine	O
if	O
that	O
would	O
affect	O
it	O

yeah	O

see	O
now	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
would	O
be	O
really	O
unfair	O
then	O
huh	O

you	O
know	O

yeah	O

find	O
out	BE
what	IP
you	C
know	C
if	C
you	C
have	O
been	O
taking	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
medication	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
would	O
effect	O
it	O
and	O
everything	O

but	O
um	O
well	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
all	O
we	O
can	O
talk	O
about	O

i	O
think	O
our	O
five	O
minutes	O
is	O
about	O
up	O
anyhow	O

okay	O
lewis	O

maybe	O
i	O
'll	O
talk	O
to	O
you	O
again	O

alrighty	O

bye-bye	O

bye	O

hi	O

sort	O
of	O

i	BE
'm	IE
a	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	C
student	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
guard	O

and	BE
they	IE
do	IE
a	IP
little	C
bit	C
of	C
drug	O
testing	O

yeah	O

uh	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
do	O
it	O
before	O
you	O
go	O
in	O

and	O
occasionally	O
they	O
'll	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
random	O
urinalysis	O

yeah	O

so	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
be	O
smoking	O
marijuana	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
the	O
military	O
anymore	O

oh	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
believe	O
they	O
should	O
too	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

definitely	O

oh	O

y-	BE_IP
uh	C

but	O
actually	O
yeah	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
randomly	O
otherwise	O
people	O
will	O
cheat	O

yeah	O

they	O

i	O
know	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
doing	O
my	O
uh	O
basic	O
training	O
in	O
a._i._t.	O
there	O
's	O
guys	O
who	O
would	O
fool	O
around	O

and	O
then	O
when	O
that	O
urinalysis	O
came	O
around	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
all	O
scared	O

so	O
it	O
does	O
work	O

it	O
is	O
effective	O

the	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
if	O

in	O
the	O
house	O
um	O
the	O
development	O
that	O
we	O
live	O
in	O
which	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
reduce	O
um	O

theft	O
burglary	O
and	O
things	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
um	O
also	O
i	O
've	O

that	O
uh	O
the	O
newest	O
thing	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
are	O
specializing	O
in	O
robbing	O
people	O
during	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
're	O
home	O
like	O
on	O
the	O
weekends	O

a	O
high	O
percentage	O
of	O
uh	O
free	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
fifty	O
percent	O
of	O
most	O
people	O
's	O
free	O
time	O
is	O
uh	O
spent	O
doing	O

so	O
they	O
wait	O
while	O
you	O
're	O
outs-	O
outdoors	O

they	O
know	O
the	O
house	O
is	O
unlocked	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
just	O
slip	BE
in	IP
slip	C
in	C
slip	O
out	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
know	O
exactly	O
what	O
they	O

so	O
i	O
've	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
on	O
the	O
rise	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
new	O
type	O
of	O
crime	O

yeah	O

unfortunately	O
yes	O

yeah	O

it	O
helps	O
to	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
my	O
neighbors	O
right	O
around	O
my	O
development	O
if	O
i	O
see	O
a	O
car	O
that	O
's	O
unfamiliar	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
have	O
a	O
list	O

is	O
that	O
what	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
did	O
in	O
your	O
program	O
where	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
license	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
uh-huh	O

yeah	O
well	O

um-hum	O

i	O
mean	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
hate	O
to	O
be	O
paranoid	O

but	O
there	O
are	O
really	O
only	O
so	O
many	O
things	O
you	O
can	O
do	O

you	O
can	O
have	O
the	O
house	O
alarm	O
um	O
neighborhood	O
watch	O
program	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O
as	O
a	O
woman	O
not	O
go	O
out	O
at	O
night	O
um	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
which	O
is	O
what	O
i	O
choose	O
to	O
do	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

that	O
's	O

um-hum	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
um	O

if	O
you	O
kill	O
someone	O
in	O
your	O
home	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	BE
're	IP
in	C
your	C
home	C
it	C

self-defense	O
though	O

it	O
is	O
n't	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

hm	O

really	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
you	O
had	O
ha-	O
a	O
handgun	O
though	O
in	O
other	O
words	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
premeditated	O
you	O
had	O
a	O
handgun	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
someone	O
's	O
down-	O

well	O
um	O
minneapolis	O
is	O
n't	O
too	O
bad	O

um	O
i	O
know	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
been	O
some	O
increases	O
in	O
crime	O
lately	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
murders	O

um	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
gone	O
up	O
in	O
scale	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
some	O
other	O
things	O

um	O
i	O
personally	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
experience	O
the	O
other	O
day	O

uh	O
somebody	O
broke	O
my	O
passenger	O
window	O
and	O
stole	O
a	O
uniform	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
truck	O

but	O
actually	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
look	O
at	BE_IP
at	C
minneapolis	O
as	O
compared	O
to	O
where	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
live	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
better	O
um	O
because	O
i	O
came	O
from	O
florida	O

and	O
in	O
orlando	O
there	BE
's	IP
crime	C
is	C
getting	C
to	C
be	C
a	O
bigger	O
problem	O
than	O
ever	O

so	O

what	O
part	O
of	O
california	O
are	O
you	O
from	O

oh	O
really	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
friend	O
there	O

yeah	O

oh	O
yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
a	O
shame	O
when	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
constrain	O
your	O
activities	O
like	O

sure	O

well	O
um	O
interestingly	O
enough	O
right	O
before	O
i	O
moved	O
up	O
here	O

i	O
'm	O
an	O
intern	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
go	O
back	O
down	O
in	O
may	O

um	O
but	O
in	O
orlando	O
before	O
i	O
moved	O
up	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
real	O
problem	O
with	O
it	O

um	O
we	O
've	O
been	O
broken	O
into	O
in	O
my	O
apartment	O
about	O
four	O
times	O
in	O
like	O
two	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
weeks	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
helped	O
organize	O
was	O
a	O
neighborhood	O
watch	O
type	O
situation	O
down	O
there	O

um	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
just	O

it	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
where	O
the	O
new	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
operate	O
in	O
the	O
daylight	O
because	O
everybody	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
then	BE_IP
the	C
houses	O
were	O
left	O
unguarded	O
um	O

but	O
yeah	O

i	O
think	O
given	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
pretty	O
conscientious	O
about	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
work	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
neighborhood	O
watch	O

oh	O
is	O
that	O
right	O

oh	O

that	O
's	O
amazing	O

yeah	O

huh	O

yeah	O

it	O
almost	O
seems	O
like	O
they	O
're	O
getting	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
smarter	O

really	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

unfortunately	O
it	O
's	O
starting	O
to	O
really	O
you	O
know	O
look	O
at	O
people	O
's	O
habits	O
and	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
at	O
particular	O
points	O
of	O
the	O
day	O

like	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
guys	O
i	O
work	O
with	O
really	O
laughs	O
when	O
he	O
looks	O
at	O
minneapolis	O
because	O
he	O
's	O
from	O
detroit	O
and	O
uh	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
crime	O
level	O
there	O
of	O
course	O
is	O
quite	BE
a	IE
bit	IP
quite	C
a	C
bit	C
uh	C
more	C
pronounced	O
um	O
but	O
uh	O
yeah	O

i	O
guess	O

i	O
think	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
neighborhood	O
watch	O
program	O
here	O
in	O
minneapolis	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
sure	O
uh	O

pretty	O
much	O

yeah	O

i	BE
was	IP
i	C
was	C
basically	O
involved	O
in	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
organization	O
of	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
left	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
where	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
there	O

but	O

yeah	O

that	O
that	O
whole	O
thing	O
of	O
being	O
alert	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
noticing	O
your	O
surroundings	O
noticing	O
people	O
who	O
look	O
suspicious	O
uh	O
activities	O
like	O
that	O
sure	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
frustrating	O
things	O
about	O
that	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
really	O
are	O
limited	O
even	O
even	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
threat	O

it	O

a	O

basically	O
um	O

when	O
i	O
was	O

down	O
in	O
florida	O
i	O
was	O
really	O

case	O
about	O
two	O

where	O
a	O

he	O
was	O

and	O
essentially	O
what	O
he	O
had	O

is	O
set	O
a	BE_IP
a	C_IP
elec-	C
a	C
electrocution	C
trap	O
for	O
the	O

in	O

the	O

came	O
in	O
while	O
he	O
was	O

and	O
sure	O
enough	O
he	O
fell	O
into	O
the	O

and	O
was	O
severely	O

he	O
did	O

he	O
was	O

clarence	O
thomas	O
or	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
stayed	O
as	O
far	O
away	O
from	O
those	O
as	O
i	O
could	O

i	O
decided	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
waste	O
the	O
time	O

i	O
had	O
i	O
guess	O
five	O
years	O
ago	O
now	O
wasted	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
time	O
with	O
oliver	O
north	O
hearings	O
and	O
afterwards	O
decided	O
that	O
what	O
i	O
had	O
gotten	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
just	O
was	O
n't	O
worth	O
the	O
time	O
i	O
put	O
in	O
and	O
that	O
these	O
things	O
are	O
just	O
very	O
slow	O
ways	O
of	O
seeing	O
information	O
come	O
out	O
think	O

um	O
why	O
do	O
n't	O
you	O
go	O
ahead	O
first	O

sure	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
uh	O

similar	O
to	BE
what	IP
we	C
're	C
doing	O
is	O
um	O
budgeting	O
you	O
know	O

month	O
to	O
month	O
is	O
uh	O
kind	O
of	O
taking	O
into	O
consideration	O
what	O
the	O
bills	O
are	O
and	O
what	O
's	O
extra	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
do	O
it	O
uh	O
from	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
depending	O
on	O
what	O
insurance	O
is	O
due	O
or	O
whatever	O

um	O
long	O
term	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
easier	O
for	O
us	O
because	O
uh	O
with	BE_IP
uh	C
our	C
jobs	O
we	O
can	O
take	O
out	O
extra	O
money	O
towards	O
savings	O
401k	O
plans	O
um	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
retirement	O
plans	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

so	O
we	O
can	O
kind	O
of	O
put	O
aside	O
some	O
money	O
that	O
actually	O
is	O
better	O
for	O
us	O
not	O
to	O
see	O
versus	O
when	O
it	O
's	O
on	O
the	O
paycheck	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
take	O
out	O
some	O
of	O
that	O
money	O

you	O
always	O
find	O
something	O
a	O
little	O
extra	O
that	O
you	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
get	O
that	O
month	O

so	O
uh	O
long	O
term	O
probably	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
better	O
than	O
short	O
term	O
simply	O
because	O
um	O
it	O
's	O
automatically	O
taken	O
out	O

so	O
uh	O
that	O
works	O
out	O
much	O
better	O
for	O
us	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
do	O
it	O
anyway	O

but	O

e-	O
exactly	O

and	O
if	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
touch	O
it	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
spend	O
it	O
either	O

so	O
that	BE_IP
kind	C
of	O
works	O
out	O
where	O
you	O
get	O
into	O
uh	O
some	O
plans	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
touch	O
it	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
penalty	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

so	O
it	O
leads	O
you	BE_IP
to	C
kind	O
of	O
say	O
well	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
out	O

i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
and	O
uh	O
keep	O
it	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
let	O
it	O
grow	O
so	O
that	O
some	BE
way	IP
maybe	C
for	C
retirement	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
that	O
money	O
left	O

let	O
's	O
hope	O
anyway	O

so	O
you	O
'll	O
have	O
that	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
do	O
it	O

but	O
ours	O
is	O
more	O
like	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
too	O
uh	O

short	O
term	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
things	O
going	O

so	O
any	O
way	O
other	O
than	O
that	O
uh	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
do	O
it	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
we	O
're	O
our	O
time	O
is	O
up	O
or	O
what	O

they	O
'll	O
let	O
us	O
know	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
definitely	O

definitely	O

and	O
uh	O
it	O
grows	O
uh	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
seems	O
like	O
at	O
first	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
big	O
return	O

but	O
as	O
the	O
years	O
go	O
on	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
with	O
the	O
company	O
for	O
any	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
then	O
it	O
gets	O
much	O
better	O

and	O
uh	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
other	O

exactly	O
whatever	O
is	O
in	O
our	O
checking	O
account	O
is	O
basically	O
just	O
about	O
what	O
gets	O
spent	O

it	O
's	O
put	O
into	O
our	O
savings	O
account	O

and	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
it	O

then	O
it	O
works	O
out	BE_IP
to	C_IE
where	C_IP
you	C
know	C
you	C
do	C
n't	C
look	O
at	O
it	O

you	O
just	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
checking	O
account	O
and	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
for	O
money	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
it	O

so	O

yeah	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
easy	O
because	O
you	O
do	O
spend	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
for	O
sure	O

like	O
i	O
said	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
kind	O
of	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
uh	O

y-	O
you	O
better	O
have	O
some	O
other	O
way	O
of	O
uh	O
savings	O

otherwise	O
uh	O
checking	O
accounts	O
are	O
n't	O
the	O
best	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
long	O
term	O
type	O
of	O
planning	O

so	O
and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
return	O
on	O
it	O
anyway	O

so	O
other	O

exactly	O

right	O
now	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
bad	O
time	O
you	O
know	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
have	O
some	O
in-laws	O
uh	O
that	O
uh	O
had	O
theirs	O
in	O
some	O
money	O
market	O
certificates	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
and	O
uh	O
kind	O
of	O
took	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
because	O
they	O
got	O
so	O
low	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
it	O
drops	O

so	O
your	O
better	O
bet	O
is	O
to	O
uh	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
with	O
something	O
with	O
your	O
corporation	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
uh	O
savings	O
plan	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
to	O
where	O
they	O
kind	O
of	O
match	O
the	O
percentage	O
or	O
whatever	O
so	O
or	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
profit	O
sharing	O

so	O

sure	O

oh	O

that	O
's	O
great	O

yeah	O

okay	O

yeah	O

exactly	O

okay	O

um	O
short	O
term	O
uh	O
it	O
works	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
cover	O
expenses	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
left	O
over	O

so	O
budgeting	O
in	O
the	O
short	O
term	O
is	O
n't	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
an	O
issue	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
much	O
uh	O
extra	O
to	O
go	O
around	O

uh	O
long	O
term	O
is	O
something	O
we	O
're	O
starting	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
because	O
our	O
older	O
child	O
will	O
be	O
ready	O
for	O
college	O
in	O
about	O
uh	O
gee	O
she	O
's	O
eight	O
now	O
so	O
i	O
guess	O
about	O
ten	O
years	O

good	O
heavens	O

so	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
starting	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
long	O
term	O
considerations	O
college	O
and	O
retirement	O

but	O
with	O
not	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
discretionary	O
money	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

how	O
about	O
you	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

right	O

and	O
the	O
old	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
see	O
it	O
then	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
spend	O
it	O
uh	O
idea	O

right	O

um-hum	O

um	O
they	O
'll	O
uh	O

yeah	O

exactly	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
actually	O
do	O
have	O
some	O
money	O
in	O
a	O
401k	O

i	O
just	O
wish	O
i	O
could	O
afford	O
to	O
uh	O
put	O
more	O
away	O
each	O
week	O
because	O
i	O
agree	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
a	BE_IP
an	C
excellent	O
way	O

right	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

checking	O
account	O
's	O
a	O
very	O
dangerous	O
place	O
for	O
money	O
to	O
be	O
i	O
'm	O
convinced	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
there	O
other	O
than	O
things	O
like	O
the	O
stock	O
market	O
or	O
mutual	O
funds	O
there	O
's	O
really	O
not	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
return	O
on	O
anything	O
these	O
days	O

yeah	O

the	O
interest	O
is	O
so	O
low	O

i	O
mean	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
nice	O
for	O
people	O
buying	O
homes	O

but	O
for	O
older	O
people	O
who	O
have	O
money	O
in	O
c._d.s	O
or	O
whatever	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
awfully	O
hard	O
to	O
see	O

go	O
down	O
to	O
three	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
percent	O
or	O
whatever	O

yeah	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
with	O
a	O
small	O
company	O
now	O

and	O
i	O
hope	O
that	O
uh	O
if	O
we	O
're	O
successful	O
that	O
they	O
'll	O
go	O
in	O
for	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
profit	O

that	O
'll	O
be	O
very	O
nice	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
running	O
out	O
of	O
steam	O
on	O
this	O
topic	O
here	O

-kay	O

i	O
see	O

uh	O
a	BE
good	IP
a	C
good	C
southern	O
solution	O

uh-huh	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O

um	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
things	O
they	O
asked	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
were	O
whether	BE
the	IP
uh	C
whether	C
the	C
judge	O
should	O
be	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
does	O
the	O
uh	O
sentencing	O

and	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
that	BE
's	IP
i	C
think	C
that	C
's	C
the	O
way	O
it	O
's	O
done	O
now	O

uh	O
at	O
least	O
my	O
understanding	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
which	O
is	O
n't	O
very	O
good	O

uh	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
judge	O
does	O
it	O

and	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
all	O
right	O
in	O
that	O
they	O
you	O
know	O
maybe	O
know	O
what	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
norm	O
is	O
for	O
a	O
particular	O
thing	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
may	BE_IP
i	C
that	O
may	O
be	O
an	O
exception	O
as	O
well	O

because	O
i	O
think	O
that	O

does	O
n't	O
the	O
jury	O
decide	O
on	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
rather	O
than	BE_IP
than	C
the	O
judge	O

yeah	O

yes	O

in	O
fact	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
execute	O
somebody	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
month	O

and	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
big	O
uproar	O
going	O
on	O
right	O
now	O
uh	O
the	O
uh	O
governor	O
you	O
know	O
has	BE_IP
been	C
trying	O
to	O
decide	O
whether	O
he	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
commute	O
it	O
or	O
not	O

it	O
was	O
someone	O
who	O
had	O
uh	O
killed	O
two	O
teenage	O
boys	O
here	O
in	O
san	O
diego	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

something	O
inexpensive	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
this	O
particular	O
case	O
has	BE_IP
been	C
like	O
ten	O
or	O
fifteen	O
years	O

but	O
i	O
guess	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
several	O
cases	O
where	O
people	O
have	O
been	O
executed	O
by	O
mistake	O

and	O
you	O
'd	O
hate	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
those	O

the	O
other	O
thing	O
they	O
asked	O
about	O
was	O
whether	O
uh	O
uh	O
the	O
verdict	O
should	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
be	O
unanimous	O
which	O
again	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
that	O
all	O
that	O
all	O
verdicts	O

well	O
maybe	O
not	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

at	O
least	O
in	O
capital	O
cases	O
i	O
'd	O
think	O
they	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
unanimous	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

the	O
paper	O
here	O
tonight	O
had	O
a	O
thing	O
about	O
the	O
noriega	O
trial	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
one	O
juror	O
that	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
uh	O
different	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
eleven	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O
've	O
only	O
deliberated	O
four	O
hours	O
or	O
something	O

and	O
they	O
say	O
they	O
're	O
hopelessly	O
deadlocked	O

judge	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
hopelessly	O
deadlocked	O
yet	O

yeah	O

six	O
months	O
so	O
far	O
they	O
said	O

so	O

maybe	O
they	O
could	O
go	O
with	O
a	O
with	O
a	O
nine	O
hundred	O
number	O
and	O
have	O
people	O
dial	O
in	O
and	O
give	O
their	O
uh	O
vote	O

right	O

oh	O
really	O

that	O
's	O
interesting	O

well	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
got	O
called	O

but	O
i	O
uh	O
never	O
uh	O
got	O
selected	O
for	O
a	O
jury	O

i	O
sat	O
for	O
tw-	O
ten	O
days	O
in	O
a	O
court	O
room	O
while	O
they	O
went	O
through	O
the	O
selection	O
process	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
guy	O
that	O
was	O
uh	O
defending	O
himself	O

well	O
i	O
say	O
the	O
uh	O

probably	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
is	O
tie	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
rope	O
and	O
throw	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
water	O

if	BE
they	IE
sink	IP
they	C
're	C
innocent	C
right	O

yeah	O

uh	O
so	O
uh	O
how	BE
do	IE
you	IP
how	C
do	C
you	C
feel	O

th-	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
of	O

facetious	O

but	O

yeah	O
um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
also	O
what	O
the	O
system	O
will	O
absorb	O

they	O
're	O
probably	O
more	O
tuned	O
in	O
to	O
that	O

possibly	O
though	O
on	O
um	O
capital	O
cases	O
like	O
maybe	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
kind	O
of	O

on	O
that	O
whether	O
the	O

you	O

even	O

they	BE

uh	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C_IE

that	IE

something	O

with	O
it	O
at	O
all	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
that	O

right	O

right	O

see	O
i	O
know	O
of	O
that	O
too	O

and	O
i	O
also	O
know	O
that	O
things	O
like	O
antihistamines	O
sudafed	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
can	O
really	O
throw	O
it	O
off	O

and	O
you	O
can	O
not	O
get	O
a	O
job	O
because	O
of	O
it	O

and	O
they	O
may	O
not	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
uh-huh	O

see	BE_IP
and	C
so	C
it	O
really	O
is	O
a	O
dangerous	O
thing	O
that	O
way	O

because	O
i	O
know	O
of	O
somebody	O
that	O
tested	O
for	O
an	O
airline	O
and	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
the	O
job	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
told	O
why	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
say	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
after	O
you	O
take	O
a	O
physical	O
will	O
be	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
drug	O
testing	O

or	O
they	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O

or	O
this	O
person	O
never	O
use	O
any	O
drugs	O

but	O
um	O
you	O
should	O

because	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
given	O
another	O
chance	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
able	O
to	O
justify	O
it	O
or	O
something	O

i	O
have	O
real	O
mixed	O
feelings	O
about	O
it	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

the	O
accuracy	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
can	O
influence	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
person	O
deserves	O
a	O
second	O
chance	O
with	O
it	O
or	O
something	O
because	O
most	O
things	O
will	O
stay	O
in	O
your	O
system	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

and	O
if	O
you	O
could	O
show	O
that	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
interviewed	O
for	O
a	O
job	O
recently	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
taking	O
entex	O
and	O
my	O
doctor	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
prescription	O
for	O
it	O

and	O
he	O
said	O
this	O
way	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
drug	O
test	O
positive	O
you	O
have	O
proof	O
that	O
your	O
doctor	O
ordered	O
this	O
for	O
you	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
it	O
did	O
n't	O
come	O
up	O
that	O
i	O
needed	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

but	O
if	O
this	O
could	O
happen	O
to	O
anybody	O

and	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
just	O
say	O
oh	O
this	O
person	O
's	O
drug	O
test	O
is	O
positive	O
we	O
wo	O
n't	O
hire	O
them	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
could	O
lose	O
out	O
on	O
a	O
job	O
when	O
really	O
you	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
anything	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
either	O

the	O
only	O
way	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
really	O
suspect	O
a	O
person	O
of	O
using	O
it	O
then	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
prove	O
it	O

because	O
they	O
say	O
they	O
can	O
spot	O
check	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
sort	O
of	O
is	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
it	O

this	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
sure	O
how	O
i	O
feel	O
about	O
it	O
because	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
from	O
two	O
ways	O

you	O
know	O
as	O
a	O
health	O
professional	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
somebody	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
me	O
that	O
was	O
using	O
drugs	O

you	O
know	O
so	O
as	O
a	O
patient	O
i	O
feel	O
well	O
yeah	O
we	O
probably	O
should	O
be	O
protected	O

but	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
i	O
should	O
be	O
protected	O
from	O
it	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
test	O
my	O
patients	O
for	O
too	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
guess	O
you	BE
sort	IE
of	IP
you	C
have	C
to	C
have	C
trust	O
some	O
place	O
along	O
the	O
way	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
go	O
around	O
testing	O
everybody	O
for	O
everything	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

and	O
i-	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
used	O
to	O
hassle	O
somebody	O

if	O
someone	O
was	O
out	O
to	O
get	O
you	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
company	O
or	O
a	O
boss	O
could	O
use	O
this	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
could	O
keep	O
on	O
doing	O
this	O
to	O
you	O
or	O
something	O
i	O
guess	O

i	O
can	O
see	O
where	O
it	O
could	O
become	O
a	O
problem	O

really	O

oh	O
wow	O
but	BE_IP
maybe	C
you	O
should	O
n't	O
be	O
held	O
responsible	O
for	O
something	O
you	O
did	O
several	O
years	O
ago	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O

i	O
mean	O
a	BE
lot	IE
of	IP
a	C
lot	C
of	C
people	O
as	O
kids	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
young	O
people	O
get	O
into	O
some	O
things	O
that	O
they	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
later	O
on	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
they	O
should	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
that	O
forever	O

so	O
yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

so	O
that	O
probably	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
too	O
good	O
either	O

uh	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
tested	O
for	O
a	O
new	O
job	O
or	O
anything	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O
um	O

they	O
can	O
if	BE_IP
they	C

y-	O
oh	O
okay	O

um	O
not	O
really	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
always	O
worked	O
on	O
a	O
university	O
level	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
tested	O
before	O
they	O
got	O
summer	O
jobs	O
and	O
stuff	O

um	O
i	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
think	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
accurate	O

because	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
know	O
their	O
lifestyles	O
changed	O
p-	O
prior	O
to	O
the	O
drug	O
test	O

and	O
i	O
know	O
they	O
changed	O
afterwards	O

yeah	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
had	O
a	O
friend	O

it	O
did	O
n't	O
cause	O
her	O
any	O
problems	O
with	O
her	O
job	O

but	O
it	O
came	O
back	O
that	O
she	O
tested	O

for	O
using	O
a	O

but	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
was	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
u-	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
um	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
malaria	O
medication	O

and	O
she	O

for	O
that	O

see	O
i	O
always	O

i	O
thought	O
they	O

you	O

called	O
back	O
if	O
you	O

for	O
more	O

how	O
uh	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
how	O
wrong	O
they	O
are	O

are	BE
they	IP
i	C
mean	C
is	O
there	O
a	O
margin	O
of	O
error	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
not	O
so	O
sure	O
they	O
're	O
that	O
needed	O

i	O
mean	O
ye-	O

if	BE_IP
you	C
're	C
using	O
it	BE_IP
while	C
at	C
a	C
job	C
i	C
can	C
see	C
a	C
problem	C

but	O
the	O
occasional	O
person	O
then	O
it	BE
's	IP
almost	C
like	C
it	C
's	C
almost	C
an	O

of	O
your	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
like	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
now	O
they	O
have	O
tests	O

i	O
guess	O
they	O
can	O
test	O
your	O
hair	O

and	O
they	O
can	O
find	O
out	O
if	O
you	O
use	O
drugs	O
up	O
to	O
several	O
years	O
ago	O

so	O

i	O
know	O

yeah	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
you	O
do	O
as	O
a	O
kid	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
n't	O
do	O
as	O
an	O

but	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
say	O
it	O
was	O
wrong	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

you	O
know	O
what	BE_IP
what	C_IP
uh	C
what	C
do	O
you	O
think	O
is	O
important	O

if	O
you	O
were	O

uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	BE_IP
how	C
old	O
you	O
are	O

but	O
if	BE
you	IE

if	C
you	C
had	C
uh	O
parents	O

or	BE_IP
or	C_IP
or	C
or	O
like	O
grandparents	O
whatever	O
it	BE
is	IP
uh	C
who	C
were	C

who	BE_IP
who	C_IP
who	C
you	O

from	O
a	O

what	O

you	O

you	O
would	O
look	O

hm	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

hm	O

well	O
my	BE_IP
uh	C
uh	C
my	C
wife	O
's	O
grandmother	O
is	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
in	O
uh	O
minnesota	O

and	O
we	O
go	O
there	O
uh	O
once	O
a	O
year	O

we	BE
see	IP
we	C
tend	O
to	O
see	O
her	O
there	O
cause	O
we	O
're	O
in	O
boston	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
pretty	O
far	O
away	O

when	O
we	O
visit	O
minnesota	O
though	O
we	O
go	O
to	O
see	O
her	O

and	O
it	O
seems	O
um	O

i	O
mean	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
environment	O
there	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
it	O

but	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
seems	O
nice	O
enough	O

uh	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
hard	O

at	O
least	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
residents	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
are	O
not	BE_IP
not	C
mentally	O
sound	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
tell	O
how	O
much	O
of	O
that	O
rubs	O
off	O
on	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
struggling	O
to	O

to	O

um	O
clarity	O
say	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
y-	O
yeah	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C_IE
don-	C_IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C

we	BE_IP
we	C
also	O
uh	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
i	O
uh	O
uh	O
volunteer	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
uh	O
nursing	O
home	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
just	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
our	O
house	O

we	BE_IP
um	C
she	C
goes	O
more	O
often	O
than	O
i	O

we	O
used	O
to	O
go	O
maybe	O
once	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
once	O
every	O
two	O
months	O
to	O
visit	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

there	O

and	O
we	O
'd	O
take	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
two	O
year	O
old	O
son	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
sometimes	O
we	O
'd	O
take	O
him	O
with	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
there	C
i	O
would	O
say	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O

it	BE
's	IE
a	IP
it	C
's	C
a	C
nice	O
uh	O
is	O
relatively	O
nice	O
environment	O

but	O
again	O
um	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
depressing	O
for	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
who	BE
are	IP
who	C_IP
who	C
are	C
just	O
too	O
old	O

essentially	O
not	O

certainly	O

all	O

uh	O

so	O
on	O

it	O
's	O
must	O
be	O
depressing	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
walk	O
walk	O
the	O

all	O

i	O

they	O
're	O

and	BE_IP

that	O
in	O
as	O

as	O
they	O

be	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
sometimes	O
you	O

i	O
've	O

uh	O
people	O

uh	O
some	O

uh	O

so	O
a-	O
at	O
some	O

the	BE_IP
the	C_IP
the	C

i	O

uh	C
the	C

what	O

um	O
some	O

um	O
gone	O
through	O
this	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
'd	O
look	O
for	O
a	O

where	O
they	O
got	O
a	O

of	O

um	O
where	O
they	O
did	O
some	O

to	O
and	O
try	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
um	O
mentally	O
alive	O
and	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
um	O

and	O

where	O
there	O
were	O

and	O

people	O
uh	O

do	O
you	O
have	O
any	O

with	O
this	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

from	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O

you	O

do	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
you	O
've	O
actually	O
had	O
some	O
experience	O
with	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
operate	O
it	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
what	O
you	O
'd	O
perceive	O
of	O
as	O
genuine	O
concern	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
possible	O

i	O
was	O
thinking	O
also	O
that	BE
there	IE
'd	IE
be	IP
there	C
could	C
be	C
a	O
fair	O
um	O
burn	O
out	O
factor	O
um	O
in	O
just	O
having	O
to	O
respond	O
to	O
people	O
's	O

where	O
the	O
needs	O
are	O
sometimes	O

on	O
the	O

what	O
we	O
would	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

so	O
it	O
gives	O
them	O
a	O

of	O

yeah	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
're	O

matches	O
what	O
i	O
h-	O
have	O
read	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
initially	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
only	O
people	O
who	O
went	O
into	O
such	O

were	O
people	O
who	BE_IP
um	C
were	C
adequately	O

in	O
their	O

um	O

or	O

that	O
they	O

but	O
i	O
also	O
know	O
a	O

of	O
people	O
whose	O

have	O
gone	O

the	BE_IP

the	O

for	O
me	O
i	O

that	O
every	O

or	O
um	O
without	O
even	O
i	O

maybe	O
once	O
a	O
month	O

i	O

you	O
buy	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
tenderloin	O
steak	O
it	O
costs	O
outrageous	O
like	O
twelve	O
dollars	O
a	O

you	O
buy	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
less	O
than	O
half	O
a	O
pound	O
so	O
it	O
's	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
dollars	O

to	O
me	O
i	O
realize	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
eight	O
kids	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
run	O
out	O

but	C
i	BE
'm	IE

i	C
'm	C
just	C

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O

so	O
if	O
you	O

on	O
how	O
you	O
buy	O

it	O
does	O

that	BE

i	C

one	C

the	C

because	O

it	O
because	O
i	O

how	O
are	O
you	O

you	O

that	O

about	O
the	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
even	O
even	O

uh	O
we	O

it	BE

when	C

you	O

you	O
were	O
out	O

and	O
we	O
did	O
that	O
pretty	O
successfully	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
months	O

and	BE_IP
then	C
we	O
started	O

and	O
in	O

we	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O

with	O
the	O

i	O

that	O
what	O

uh	O

so	O
we	BE

we	C_IE
're	C_IE

we	C
're	C
actually	C

it	O
's	O
very	O
much	O
the	O

kind	O
of	O

and	O
a	O
technical	O

uh	O

uh	O
some	O

the	O
uh	O
the	O

uh	O
the	O

what	BE

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

now	O
how	O
do	O
you	O

that	O

i	O
know	O
it	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
think	O
it	O
's	O
better	O

the	O

or	O

t-	O
hm	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
heard	O
of	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
companies	O
that	O
have	O
done	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
uh	O
back	O
about	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
ago	O
when	O
things	O
were	O
tough	O
hewlett	O
packard	O
did	O
that	O
for	O
awhile	O

they	O
went	O
to	O
a	BE_IP
uh	C
uh	C
a	C
four	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
day	O
work	O
week	O
rather	O
than	BE
cut	IP
yeah	C
just	C
cut	O
everybody	O
back	O
ten	O
percent	O
and	O
uh	O
have	O
gave	O
everybody	O
a	O
half	O
day	O
a	O
week	O
off	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
while	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O

yeah	O

uh	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
georgia	O
tech	O

yes	O
sir	O

i	O
work	O
for	O
the	O
research	O

um	O
and	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
small	O
in	O
a	O

but	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
does	O
have	O
about	O
uh	O
i	O
guess	O
two	O
thousand	O
civil	O
employees	O

and	O
on	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
scale	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
still	O

it	O
just	O

a	O

the	O

right	O
uh	O

um-hum	O

right	O

well	O
those	O
and	O
probably	O
the	O

of	O
it	O

because	O
a	O

nowadays	O
even	O

you	BE

uh	C
you	C

in	O

in	O
a	O

you	O

more	O

a	O

instead	O
of	O
a	BE_IP
a	C

because	O
when	O
it	O

down	O
to	O

they	O

really	O

and	O
you	O

how	O
they	O

they	O

about	O
this	O

uh	O

i	O
think	O
the	O

exists	O

what	O
they	O
used	O
to	O

is	O
they	O
used	O
to	O

the	O

for	O
everybody	O
as	O

you	O

that	O

that	O
you	O

one	O

one	O

at	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O

i	O
think	O
if	O
they	O

that	O

to	O

that	O

a	O

better	O
you	O
know	O
other	O
than	O
s-	O
you	O
know	O
something	O
like	O

unemployment	O
is	O
good	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
the	O
company	O
as	O
a	O
whole	O

because	O
you	O
as	O
an	O

even	O
though	O
the	O

is	O
making	O
money	O

they	O
paying	O
you	O
a	O

but	O
you	O
are	O

for	O
that	O

you	O
're	O

to	O
the	O
par-	O
point	O
that	O
it	O

at	O
at	O

so	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
something	O
in	O
there	O
or	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O

that	O

you	O

uh	O

or	O
something	O

that	O

you	O

it	O
's	O

a	O

you	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

now	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

a	O

so	O
oh	O
you	O
do	O

you	O
read	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
then	O

yeah	O
um-hum	O

sure	O

oh	O
sure	O

to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
it	BE
or	IP
if	C_IP
they	C
uh	O
criticize	O
you	O
or	O
put	O
something	O
in	O
there	O
wrong	O

sure	O

sure	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

sure	O

exactly	O

uh-huh	O

sure	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
kind	O

like	O
you	O
said	O
then	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
are	O
kind	O

on	O
the	O

where	O
i	O
get	O

uh	O
while	O
i	O
'm	O
cooking	O

the	O

uh	O

a	O

when	O
we	O

everybody	O
was	O

the	O

no	O

it	O
's	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

sure	O

yep	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
brought	O
kind	BE
of	IP
more	C
of	C
a	O
vivid	O
uh	O
look	BE
at	IP
what	C
was	C
going	O
on	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
dropping	O
the	O
bombs	O
and	O
just	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
different	O
things	O

but	O
um	O
yeah	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

you	BE
know	IP
you	C
know	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
read	O
the	O

to	O

to	O
get	O
the	O

what	O

uh	O
other	O
people	O
that	O
you	O

do	O
it	O
differently	O
or	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
watch	O
any	O

at	O
all	O

so	O
but	O

exactly	O
happens	O

sure	O

sure	O

that	O
's	O

oh	O
sure	O

a	BE
clip	IP
you	C
know	C
a	C
sentence	C
or	O
two	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
it	O
of	O
what	BE_IP
went	C
on	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O
have	O
so	O
much	O
other	O
information	O
to	O
cover	O
in	O
just	O
a	O
short	O
period	O
of	O
time	O

sure	O

makes	O
sense	O

yeah	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
right	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
line	O

you	O
're	O
not	O
uh	O
further	O
up	O

you	O
're	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

sure	O

i	O
suppose	O
you	O
watch	O
for	O
hurr-	O
hurricanes	O
coming	O
in	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

sure	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
the	O
only	O
time	O

in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
summer	O
um	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
watching	O
t._v.	O
for	O
the	O
weather	O
even	O
though	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
predict	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
they	O
'll	O
kind	O
of	O
say	O
well	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
thunderstorm	O
warning	O
or	O
whatever	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
what	O
is	O
expected	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
times	O
things	O
happen	O
and	O
change	O
here	O
so	O
drastically	O
uh	O
so	O
fast	O
you	O
know	O
where	O
movement	O
that	O
was	O
coming	O
in	O
has	O
shifted	O
or	O
whatever	O

so	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

to	O
take	O
off	O

sure	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
sounds	O
pretty	O
good	O

so	O
anyway	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
our	O
time	O
is	O
getting	O
up	O
here	O

or	BE_IP
it	C
's	C

to	O
be	O
fairly	O
close	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
any	O

kind	O
of	O
the	O

you	O

i	O
get	O
all	O

so	O
we	BE

we	C

two	O

yeah	O

two	O

in	O
the	O

and	O
uh	O
i	BE

what	O
uh	O
what	O

and	O
uh	O
that	BE

that	C
's	C
a	O
problem	O
that	O

is	O
not	O
it	O
's	O
getting	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
brief	O
uh	O
idea	O
of	O
what	O
's	O
happening	O

but	O

right	O

but	O
i	O
like	O
the	O
weather	O
report	O

so	O
i	O
-way-	O

i	BE
always	IP
i	C
always	C
turn	O
that	O
on	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
part	O
i	O
watch	O
because	O
uh	O
of	O
uh	O
i	O
go	O
surfing	O
down	O
here	O

and	O
i	O
always	O
want	BE
to	IP
watch	C
the	C
weather	O
for	O
when	O
the	O
waves	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
good	O

yeah	O

no	O

right	O
on	O
south	O
florida	O
coast	O
where	O
the	O
weather	O
is	O
still	O
warm	O
here	O

yeah	O

yep	O

weather	O
channel	O
's	O
good	O

but	O
yeah	O

i	O
mostly	O
look	O
for	O
the	O
storms	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
ocean	O
uh	O
hundreds	O
of	O
miles	O
out	O

so	O
i	O
can	O
predict	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
week	O
and	O
where	O
i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

so	O
i	O
can	O
be	O
at	BE
the	IP
at	C
the	C
beach	O
when	O
the	O
waves	O
start	O
coming	O
in	O
how	O
much	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
five	O

right	O

well	O
five	O
are	BE_IP
i	C
mean	O
four	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
grown	O

they	O
're	O
in	O
college	O
or	O
just	O
out	O
of	O
college	O

so	O
i	O
really	O
have	O
just	O
a	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
at	O
home	O

well	O
i	O
work	O
at	O
it	O

i	O
try	O
to	O
fool	O
everybody	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
right	O

because	O
i	O
was	O
an	O
only	O
child	O
too	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
reason	O
i	O
have	O
so	O
many	O
because	O
i	O
really	O
i	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
big	O
family	O

and	O
my	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
is	O
pretty	O
separate	O
from	O
her	O
brother	O
and	O
sisters	O

and	O
so	O
she	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
like	O
an	O
only	O
child	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
same	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O
um	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
exactly	O
how	O
it	O
is	O
you	O
know	O

she	O
's	O
got	O
all	O
these	O
sisters	O
and	O
her	O
brother	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
her	O

when	O
things	O
do	O
n't	O
go	O
right	O
she	O
just	O
calls	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
um	O
yeah	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
little	O
bit	O
difficult	O
though	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
easier	O
when	O
they	O
all	O
had	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
could	O
entertain	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
i	O
was	O
home	O
more	O

and	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
really	O
did	O
not	O

my	O
next	O
oldest	O
daughter	O
that	O
's	O
in	O
college	O
in	O
california	O
is	O
a	O
world	O
twirling	O
champion	O

she	O
twirls	O
a	O
baton	O

and	O
we	O
did	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
together	O

she	O
and	O
i	O
did	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
together	O
and	O
flew	O

we	O
've	O
flown	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
world	O
for	O
her	O
to	O
compete	O
and	O
to	O
perform	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun	O

but	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
i	O
guess	O
you	O
could	O
consider	O
that	O
organized	O

i	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
competition	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

we	O
were	O
very	O
heavy	O
into	O
that	O

other	O
than	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
much	O

and	O
maybe	O
dancing	O
school	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
or	O
mainly	O
school	O
sports	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
afford	O
to	O

right	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
know	O
i	O
spent	O
hours	O
in	O
the	O
gym	O
everyday	O
with	O
my	O
daughter	O

and	O
my	O
little	O
one	O
also	O
competed	O
because	O
really	O
she	O
had	O
no	O
choice	O

she	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
me	O

so	O
the	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
just	O
spent	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
traveling	O
and	O
and	O
competing	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
the	O
competing	O
itself	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
matter	O
what	O
it	O
was	O

it	O
was	O
making	O
the	O
friends	O
and	O
going	O
all	O
the	O
places	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
really	O
neat	O
experience	O

but	O
it	O
took	O
our	O
total	O
time	O

i	O
did	O
not	O
work	O
um	O
when	O
i	O
did	O
this	O

now	O
i	O
do	O
work	O
full	O
time	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
my	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
and	O
myself	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
together	O
to	O
get	O
just	O
her	O
activities	O
in	O
and	O
still	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
spend	O
with	O
each	O
other	O

yeah	O

really	O

well	O
things	O
cost	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
georgia	O
and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
our	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
is	O
particularly	O
bad	O
compared	O
to	O
some	O

is	O
it	O

really	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
've	O
heard	O

hm	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
surprised	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O

i	O
've	O
heard	O
very	O
positive	O
things	O
about	O
atlanta	O
everybody	O

how	O
many	O
children	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
now	O

you	O
have	O
five	O

well	O
you	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
hard	O
time	O
finding	O
time	O
then	O
do	O
n't	O
you	O

um-hum	O

you	O
sound	O
so	O
young	O

to	O
have	O
them	O
uh	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
doing	O
a	O
good	O
job	O

i	O
just	O
have	O
one	O
child	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
um	O

well	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
much	O
i	O
can	O
do	O
about	O
it	O

my	BE_IP
my	C
wife	O
and	O
i	O
are	O
uh	O
in	O
our	O
forties	O
you	O
know	O

so	BE_IP
uh	C
but	C
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
raise	O
one	O
child	O
without	O
them	O
thinking	O
they	BE
're	IE
the	IP
they	C
're	C
the	C
pivot	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
universe	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
younger	O
brother	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
'm	O
in	O
my	O
forties	O
like	O
i	O
say	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
brother	O
in	O
his	O
twenties	O

and	O
i	BE
was	IP
i	C
was	C
the	O
youngest	O

so	O
i	O
understand	O
how	O
that	O
worked	O

and	O
he	O
was	O
treated	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
five	O
fathers	O
or	O
something	O

yeah	O

did	O
y'	O
all	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
organized	O
things	O
like	O
uh	O
little	O
league	O
uh	O
soccer	O

an-	O
uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
true	O
the	O

if	O
you	O
have	O
one	O
child	O
or	O
fewer	O
you	O
get	O
involved	O
in	O
organized	O
events	O
or	O
activities	O

and	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
large	O
number	O
of	O
children	O
or	BE_IP
then	C
you	O
do	O
n't	O

no	O

you	O
c-	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
enough	O
time	O
um	O
like	BE_IP
my	C
son	O
is	O
in	O
uh	O
little	O
league	O
this	O
year	O

he	O
's	O
ten	O

and	O
they	O
practice	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
game	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
uh	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
child	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
there	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
one	O
parent	O
go	O
in	O
one	O
direction	O

and	O
i	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
the	O
other	O

and	O
we	O
could	O
only	O
cover	O
two	O
at	O
that	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
although	O

i	O
think	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
more	O
than	O
one	O
child	O
probably	O
three	O
children	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
ideal	O
to	O
me	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
i	O
could	O
afford	O
three	O

i	O
most	O
certainly	O
could	O
n't	O
educate	O
three	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
parents	O
did	O
it	O

i	O
mean	O
there	O
were	O
five	O
of	O
us	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
recall	O
you	O
know	O
wanting	O
anything	O
in	O
particular	O

uh	O
but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	BE_IP
my	C
father	O
did	O
it	O

he	O
worked	O
at	O
a	O
truck	O
line	O

and	O
he	O
just	O
did	O
n't	O
make	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
money	O
with	O
five	O
children	O

but	O
we	O
did	O
okay	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
house	O
and	O
a	O
home	O
and	O

but	O
now	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
i	O
both	O
work	O

and	O
we	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
believe	O
we	O
have	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
my	O
parents	O
did	O

and	O
we	O
only	O
have	O
one	O
child	O

um-hum	O

um	O

atlanta	O
's	O
horrible	O

yes	O

ha-	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
moving	O
here	O
from	O
boston	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
different	O
areas	O

and	O
from	O
talking	O
to	O
them	O
they	O
're	O
shocked	O

wha-	O

and	O
they	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
housing	O
so	O
cheap	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
boston	O
that	O
they	O
jump	O
on	O
it	O

they	O
sell	O
their	O
house	O

they	O
stash	O
away	O
a	O
good	O
bit	O
of	O
money	O
and	O
come	O
down	O
here	O

and	O
i	O
work	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
them	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
think	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
've	C
really	O
done	O
something	O

then	O
when	O
they	O
get	O
down	O
here	O
they	O
realize	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
living	O
is	O
outrageous	O
compared	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
where	O
they	O
came	O
from	O

the	O
housing	O
's	O
cheaper	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
it	O

i	O
uh	O
try	O
to	O
stay	O
away	O
from	O
cars	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
repair	O

actually	O
uh	O
that	O
is	O
really	O
a	O
sore	O
spot	O
with	O
me	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
perhaps	O
the	O
automotive	O
industry	O
is	O
improving	O

but	O
uh	O
like	O
ten	O
years	O
ago	O
um	O
the	O
reliability	O
of	O
automobiles	O
at	O
least	O
u._s.	O
automobiles	O
was	O
pretty	O
dismal	O

and	O
not	O
only	O
that	O
but	O
the	O
uh	O
repair	O
capability	O
of	O
uh	O
service	O
departments	O
and	O
dealerships	O
was	O
equally	O
dismal	O
and	O
uh	O
it	O
seemed	O
that	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
i	O
could	O
reliably	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
my	O
car	O
was	O
to	O
repair	O
it	O
myself	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
my	O
cup	O
of	O
tea	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O

pardon	O

well	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
actually	O
i	O
had	O
a	O
volkswagen	O
rabbit	O
and	O
um	O
it	BE
was	IE
i-	IP
it	C
was	C
a	O
real	O
lemon	O

uh	O
subsequently	O
i	O
got	O
a	O
uh	O
buick	O
century	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
as	O
bad	O

but	O
uh	O
last	O
year	O
i	BE
bought	IP
a	C
honda	C
accord	O

and	O
i	O
take	O
it	O
in	O
once	O
every	O
seventy	O
five	O
hundred	O
miles	O
for	O
its	O
periodic	O
maintenance	O

and	O
that	O
is	BE_IP
it	C

and	O
it	O
's	O
wonderful	O

an-	O
hm	O

hm	O

hm	O

so	BE
what	IE
do	IE
you	IP
what	C
do	C
you	C
have	O

all	O
the	O
more	O
reason	O
to	O
uh	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
honda	O

s-	BE_IP
so	C
you	O
bought	O
a	O
pontiac	O

now	O
thi-	O

wha-	BE_IP
how	C
old	O
is	O
the	O
car	O

hm	O

hm	O

hm	O

so	O
apparently	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
on	O
there	O

oh	O
we	O
just	O
uh	O
refi-	BE_IP
re-	C
uh	O
probably	O
filled	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
brake	O
fluid	O
up	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
it	O

so	O
what	O
's	O
the	O
solution	O
to	O
that	O
i	O
guess	O
find	O

and	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
was	O

so	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
my	O
church	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
mechanic	O

and	O
i	O

so	O
he	O

trying	O
to	O

but	O
it	O

just	O
you	O

leak	O
leak	O
leak	O
everywhere	O

but	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
hate	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
repair	O
place	O
because	O
they	O
'll	O
tell	O
me	O
something	O
's	O
wrong	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
charge	O
me	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O

the	O
last	O
time	O
i	O
took	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
repair	O
shop	O

the	O
man	O
told	O
me	O
i	O
needed	O
a	O
master	O
cylinder	O

so	O
i	O
said	O
okay	O

and	O
he	O
charged	O
me	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
thirty	O
something	O
dollars	O

and	O
then	O
um	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
later	O
a	O
man	O
was	O
looking	O
at	O
my	O

and	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O

you	O
know	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
not	O
a	O
repair	O
man	O
but	O
just	O
a	O
friend	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
telling	O
him	O
that	O
i	O
just	O
had	O
a	O
new	O
master	O
cylinder	O
put	O
on	O

and	O
he	O
s-	O
looked	O
at	O

and	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
new	O
master	O
cylinder	O
and	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
even	O
know	O
what	O
one	O
was	O

and	O
um	O
he	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
me	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
old	O
rusty	O
just	O
awful	O

it	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
new	O
than	O
nothing	O

oh	O
more	O
than	O
likely	O

that	O
was	O
it	O
probably	O

it	O
was	O
ver-	O

i	O
was	O
so	O
irritated	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
happened	O
to	O
me	O
more	O
than	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
jus-	O
jus-	O
just	O
about	O
every	O
time	O
i	O
've	O
went	O
in	O
somewhere	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
you	O
ju-	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
hardly	O
find	O
one	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
guy	O
that	O
's	O
doing	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
my	O
car	O
now	O
um	O
goes	O
to	O
my	O
church	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
go	O
to	O
him	O
because	O
i	O
know	O
him	O

and	O
i	O
know	O
he	O
will	O
tell	O
me	O
the	O
truth	O

because	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
even	O
charge	O
me	O
for	O
for	O
doing	O
it	O

so	O
he	O
's	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
take	O
me	O

yeah	O
i	O
just	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
parts	O

and	O
he	O
does	O
it	O
so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
am	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
solution	O
to	O
that	O
is	O
because	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
you	O
buy	O
your	O
car	O
they	O
're	O
usually	O
the	O
worst	O
one	O
of	O
all	O

we	O
took	O
our	O
honda	O
to	O
the	O
honda	O
dealership	O

and	BE_IP
they	C
ended	O
up	O
telling	O
us	O
we	O
needed	O
a	O
brand	O
new	O
engine	O
for	O
our	O
car	O

yeah	O

and	O
so	O
idiots	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
neither	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
knew	O
much	O
about	O
cars	O

we	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
they	C
told	O
us	O
we	O
just	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
one	O

and	O
we	O
bought	O
one	O

we	O
did	O
n't	O
no	O
more	O
need	O
no	O
new	O
engine	O

give	O
me	O
a	O

you	O

so	O
it	BE

it	C
was	C
not	O
good	O

and	O
um	O

well	O
um	O
preferred	O
benefits	O
um	O

i	O
worked	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
corporation	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
large	O
corporations	O
can	O
give	O
better	O
benefits	O
than	O
small	O
corporations	O
because	O
right	O
now	O
i	O
'm	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
corporation	O
where	O
the	O

is	O
right	O
there	O

and	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

that	O
's	O
coming	O
in	O

but	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
uh	O
small	O
corporations	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
pocket	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
quick	O
quickly	O
or	O
whatever	O
or	O
however	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
it	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
benefits	O
are	O
n't	O
as	O
great	O
as	O
when	O
i	O
worked	O
for	O
a	O
big	O
corporation	O
because	O
the	O
big	O
corporations	O
seem	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
its	O
employees	O
and	O
say	O
okay	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
this	O

of	O

let	O

tha-	BE_IP
that	C

big	O

you	O

they	BE

so	O
i	O

i	O
've	O

for	O

even	O
hate	O
to	O

out	O

at	O

and	O
now	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
the	O
framingham	O
school	O
tea-	O
uh	O
school	O
system	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
have	O
much	O
better	O

you	O

the	O

we	O
have	O
a	O
good	O

me	O
see	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
profit	O

to	O
a	O

right	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
eye	O

the	O
health	O

and	O
the	O
whole	O
kit	O
and	O
caboodle	O
because	O
what	O
they	O
did	O
is	O
they	O
threw	O
the	O
all	O
the	O
town	O
employees	O
in	O
together	O

yeah	O

really	O

oh	O

right	O

the	O
only	O
trouble	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
here	O
in	O
massachusetts	O
is	O
the	O
town	O
and	O
state	O
employees	O
have	O
run	O
into	O
problem	O
especially	O
the	O
retired	O
ones	O

my	O
father	O
's	O
retired	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
framingham	O
and	O
he	BE
said	IE
that	IP
they	C
have	C
n't	C
gotten	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
cost	O
of	O
living	O
raise	O
in	O
over	O
five	O
years	O

and	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
really	O
stinks	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
being	O
retired	O

an-	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
hear	O
that	O
bill	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
senate	O
right	O
now	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
hopefully	O
will	O
go	O
through	O

but	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
schools	O
are	BE
at	IP
where	C
the	C
schools	O
is	O
n't	O
just	O
the	O
school	O
system	O
and	O
not	O
just	O
the	O
teachers	O

they	O
took	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
town	O
plus	O
all	O
you	O
know	O

uh	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
teachers	O
union	O
which	O
helps	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O

but	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
framingham	O
pays	O
the	O
benefits	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
the	O
town	O
workers	O
water	O
and	O
sewer	O
and	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
town	O

it	O
's	O
actually	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
city	O

but	O
they	O
kept	O
it	O
a	O
town	O

um	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
extremely	O
large	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
offer	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
which	O
was	O
really	O
great	O
because	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
a	O
mayor	O

right	O

because	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
town	O
employees	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
uh	O
electoral	O
positions	O
are	O
part	O

so	O
it	O
works	O
out	O
good	O
because	O
we	O
reap	O
the	O
benefits	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
um	O
but	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
shopping	O
for	O
a	O
job	O
i	O
'd	O
rather	O
shop	O
for	O
the	O
benefits	O
than	O
the	O
salary	O

right	O

right	O

uh	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
anyone	O
that	BE_IP
uh	C_IE
has	C_IP
is	C
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
or	O
has	O
ever	O
been	O
in	O
one	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
trying	O
to	O
think	O

my	BE_IP
uh	C
uh	C
wife	C
's	O
grandmother	O
had	O
alzheimer	O
's	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
put	O
her	O
into	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
nursing	O
home	O

and	O
uh	O
they	BE_IP
when	C
they	C
put	O
her	O
in	BE_IP
she	C
had	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
trouble	O

and	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
made	O
them	O
come	O
and	O
take	O
her	O
back	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
being	O
a	BE_IP
a	C_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
a	C_IP
a	C
nuisance	O
or	O
worse	O
than	O
a	O
nuisance	O

i	O
mean	O
sh-	BE_IP
she	C
sort	O
of	O
went	O
you	O
know	O
bananas	O

and	O
they	O
could	BE
n't	IP
could	C
n't	C
deal	O
with	O
her	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
uh	O
know	O
whether	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
you	O
know	O
no	O
deposit	O
no	O
return	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
whether	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

my	O
grandmother	O
actually	O
was	O
in	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
nursing	O
home	O
that	O
um	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
retirement	O
hotel	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
uh	O

there	O
was	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
full-time	O
care	O
place	O
that	O
was	O
also	O
associated	O
with	O
it	O

so	O
for	O
um	O
the	O
first	O
few	O
years	O
she	O
had	O
her	O
own	O
apartment	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
made	O
her	O
own	O
meals	O
sometimes	O
but	O
could	O
could	O
also	O
go	O
and	O
eat	O
someplace	O
else	O

and	BE_IP
then	C
um	O
as	O
she	O
became	O
less	O
able	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
herself	O
then	O
she	O
moved	O
into	O
this	O
other	O
part	O
that	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
um	O
provide	O
full-time	O
care	O

and	O
um	O
she	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O
anymore	O

but	O
my	O
experience	O
has	O
been	O
that	O
most	O
people	O
that	O
move	O
into	O
nursing	O
homes	O
die	O
very	O
quickly	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
some	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
whether	O
that	O
's	O
because	O
they	O
you	O
know	O
sort	O
of	O
give	O
up	O
hope	O
once	O
they	O
get	O
in	O
there	O
or	BE_IP
what	C_IE
the	C_IP
what	C
the	C
reason	O
is	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
average	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
that	O
somebody	O
lives	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
is	O
only	O
like	O
six	O
months	O
or	O
something	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

if	BE_IP
if	C
you	O
can	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
yourself	O
at	O
all	O
or	O
have	O
someone	O
that	O
can	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
you	O
then	O
you	O
stay	O
where	O
you	O
are	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
only	O
go	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
last	O
resort	O

or	O
people	O
send	O
you	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
last	O
resort	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

right	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O

right	O

when	O
you	O
need	O
it	O
you	O
need	O
it	O
i	O
guess	O

right	O

yeah	O

sure	O

and	O
you	O
probably	O
if	BE_IP
it	C
were	O
you	O
you	O
probably	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
someone	O
choosing	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
live	O
based	O
on	O
lowest	O
price	O

yeah	O

well	O
maybe	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
is	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
go	O
someplace	O
where	O
they	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
worth	O
continuing	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O

i	O
've	O
known	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
um	O
gone	O
to	O
retirement	O
communities	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
them	O
back	O
there	O

but	O
here	O
in	O
california	O
and	O
in	O
ariz-	O

no	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
my	C
grandparents	O
were	O
looking	O
into	O
it	O
before	O

so	O
i	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
've	O
said	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
they	BE
thought	IP
it	C
was	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
bother	O

right	O

if	O
they	O
're	O
equipped	O
too	O
to	O
handle	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
patients	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
you	O
know	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
there	O
too	O

because	O
i	O
know	O
my	O
grandparents	O
wanted	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
independence	O
still	O

they	O
wanted	O
someplace	O
they	O
can	O
go	O
and	O
have	O
their	O
meals	O
and	O
a	O
nurse	O
on	O
staff	O
just	O
in	O
case	O
they	O
needed	O
her	O

but	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
be	O
independent	O
as	O
well	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
room	O

um-hum	O

well	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
people	O
go	O
to	O
it	O
because	O
they	O
need	O
help	O

they	O
need	O
health	O
care	O

so	O
they	O
're	O
already	O
ill	O
before	O
they	O
go	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
large	O
factor	O

um-hum	O

right	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
my	O
grandparents	O

it	O
was	O
just	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
relatives	O
would	BE_IP
have	C
peace	O
of	O
mind	O
knowing	O
that	O
if	O
anything	O
happened	O
there	O
was	O
somebody	O
there	O
for	O
them	O

so	O
that	O
was	O
their	O
thinking	O

somebody	O
who	O
would	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
an	O
emergency	O

and	O
also	O
so	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
someplace	O
they	O
enjoyed	O
while	O
they	O
still	O
had	O
choices	O
to	O
make	O
so	O
they	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
stuck	O
going	O
into	O
just	O
whatever	O
nursing	O
home	O
was	O
available	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
problem	O
too	O
for	O
people	O
wait	O
lists	O
and	O
all	O

that	O
um	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
always	O
get	O
in	O
when	O
you	O
want	O
to	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
just	O
sit	O
around	O
and	O
wait	O

yeah	O

and	O
the	O
money	O
is	O
also	O
another	O
issue	O
how	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O

at	O
that	O
stage	O
of	O
life	O
you	O
only	O
have	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
left	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
exactly	O
fair	O
for	O
the	O
younger	O
family	O
members	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
their	O
savings	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
fair	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
also	O
not	O
fair	O
because	O
they	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
children	O
to	O
raise	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
another	O
problem	O

right	O

right	O

so	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
just	O
so	O
complicated	O
anymore	O
i	O
think	O

people	O
outlive	O
their	O
savings	O

and	O
with	O
medicine	O
being	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
you	O
're	O
extending	O
life	O
where	O
sometimes	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
living	O
has	O
gone	O
down	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
necessarily	O
enjoying	O
life	O
anymore	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
shame	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
be	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
retirement	O
home	O
idea	O
's	O
a	O
nice	O
idea	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
find	O
older	O
people	O
and	O
with	O
similar	O
interests	O
and	O
someplace	O
to	O
stay	O

and	O
because	O
uh	O
like	O
if	O
your	O
spouse	O
died	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
you	O
be	O
all	O
alone	O
it	O
'd	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
go	O
someplace	O
people	O
similar	O
to	O
you	O
and	O
have	O
friends	O

um	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
uh	O
three	O
boys	O
through	O
i	O
guess	O
uh	O
some	O
child	O
care	O
each	O
one	O
of	O
them	O

an-	O
now	O
they	O
're	O
in	O
school	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
over	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
find	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
most	O
parents	O
would	O
want	O

is	O
that	O
right	O

i	O
guess	O
uh	O
the	BE_IP
um	C
the	C
only	O
rule	O
i	O
can	O
think	O
of	O
is	O
that	O
uh	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
fi-	O
look	O
for	O
places	O
with	O
uh	O
good	O
respectable	O
nonprofit	O
behind	O
them	O
like	O
a	O
university	O
or	O
a	O
hospital	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

if	O
they	O
're	O
associated	O
with	O
a	O
college	O
or	O
a	O
university	O
they	O
're	O
usually	O
pretty	O
good	O
bet	O

um	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
the	O
opposite	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
would	O
want	O
when	O
you	O
buy	O
car	O
or	O
refrigerator	O
something	O

you	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
from	O
some	O
good	O
cutthroat	O
capitalist	O
company	O
but	O
not	O
with	O
child	O
care	O

i	O
yeah	O

for	O
profit	O
places	O
i	O
would	O
really	O
look	O
at	O
them	O
awfully	O
carefully	O

but	O
uh	O
when	BE
i	IE
was	IP
when	C
my	C
kids	O
were	O
young	O
i	O
was	O
teaching	O
at	O
a	O
university	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
child	O
care	O
center	O
associated	O
with	O
our	O
university	O
was	O
quite	O
good	O

so	O
i	O
felt	O
confident	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
the	O
right	O

thing	O
oh	O
you	O
mean	O
uh	O
learning	O
type	O
uh	O
yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
actual	O
experiments	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
your	O
permission	O

but	O
yeah	O

i	O
suppose	O
um	O
if	BE
you	IE
're	IP
if	C_IP
there	C
's	C
a	O
psychology	O
department	O
or	O
an	O
education	O
department	O
around	O
you	O
might	O
find	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
pushing	O
one	O
form	O
of	O
education	O
or	O
another	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
bad	O
experience	O
in	O
that	O
respect	O

of	O
course	O
you	O
also	O
tend	O
to	O
get	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
associated	O
with	O
the	O
university	O
and	O
the	O
hospital	O
as	O
the	O
parents	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
you	O
know	O

pretty	O
good	O
people	O

um-hum	O

i	O
yeah	O

i	O
never	O
really	O
worry	O
very	O
much	O
about	O
it	O

i	O
tend	O
to	O
think	O
those	O
are	O
very	O
rare	O
but	O
quickly	O
exploited	O
and	O
made	O
public	O

so	O
i	O
never	O
really	O
worried	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
that	O
being	O
uh	O
uh	O
the	O
case	O
with	O
my	O
boys	O

um	O
i	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
think	O
those	O
things	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
headlines	O
immediately	O
when	O
somebody	O
finds	O
out	O
about	O
them	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
as	O
common	O
as	O
uh	O
the	O
newspapers	O
would	O
make	O
you	O
believe	O

oh	O
yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
that	O

right	O

well	O
in	O
our	O
case	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
decision	O
that	O
my	O
wife	O
would	O
stay	O
home	O
until	O
the	O
boys	O
were	O
um	O
in	O
school	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
really	O
happy	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
although	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
very	O
difficult	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
right	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

when	O
we	O
were	O
um	O
we	O
just	O
decided	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
it	O

and	O
we	O
went	O
ahead	O

but	O
um	O
not	O
everybody	O
can	O
make	O
that	O
choice	O

and	O
even	O
even	O
though	O
my	O
wife	O
was	O
n't	O
working	O
we	O
did	O
have	O
um	O
one	O
or	O
another	O
of	O
the	O
boys	O
in	O
uh	O
child	O
care	O
for	O
part	O
ti-	O
just	O
for	O
uh	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
um	O
or	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
days	O
a	O
week	O
just	O
so	O
that	O
uh	O
other	O
things	O
could	O
get	O
done	O
around	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
so	O
on	O

so	BE_IP
so	C
we	O
did	O
look	O
around	O

i	O
think	O
my	O
wife	O
is	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
i	O
am	O
at	O
just	O
walking	O
into	O
a	O
place	O
and	O
getting	O
a	O
feeling	O
for	O
whether	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
loving	O
and	O
caring	O
place	O
or	O
not	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
so	C
i	O
would	O
always	O
trust	O
her	O
judgment	O
on	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

there	O
's	O
absolutely	O
no	O
question	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
child	O
care	O
provider	O
for	O
that	O
kid	O

so	O
yeah	O
do	O
it	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
you	O
can	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
y-	BE_IP
you	C
have	C
to	O
look	O
through	O
a	O
place	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
feel	O
for	O
um	O
how	O
they	O
treat	O
the	O
kids	O
and	O
uh	O
uh	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
staff	O
members	O
they	O
have	O
and	O
how	O
much	O
turnover	O
they	O
have	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
before	O
you	O
uh	O
commit	O
your	O
child	O
to	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
main	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
determine	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
perfectly	O
open	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
welcome	O
anytime	O
without	O
notice	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O

and	O
if	BE_IP
they	C_IE
're	C_IP
at	C
all	C
queasy	O
about	O

um-hum	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
really	O
think	O
the	O
news	O
reports	O
are	O
uh	O
tend	O
to	O
sensationalize	O
the	O
problems	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
problems	O
are	O
more	O
ones	O
of	O
cost	O
and	O
resources	O
and	O
um	O
pay	O
and	O
exhaustion	O
and	O
human	O
things	O
like	O

rather	O
than	BE_IP
these	C
um	O
uh	O
really	O
wi-	O
wild	O
abuse	O
cases	O
that	O
you	O
read	O
about	O
because	O
it	O
make	O
good	O
copy	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
right	O
uh-huh	O
well	O

well	O
i	O
can	O

this	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O

n-	O

i	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

some	O
such	O
thing	O

yes	O

um	O
well	O
the	O
thing	O
i	O
really	O
worry	O
about	O
is	O
um	O
the	O
sexual	O
abuse	O
cases	O
you	O
read	O
about	O

and	O
i	O
mean	O
you	O
just	O
feel	O
awful	O
if	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
happened	O

um-hum	O

oh	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

and	O
another	O
thing	O
is	O
cost	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
know	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
school	O
with	O
who	O
are	O
having	O
babies	O
right	O
now	O

and	O
they	O
finding	O
some	O
cases	O
they	O
're	O
finding	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
not	O
worth	O
it	O
to	O
work	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
going	O
out	O
in	O
day	O
care	O

hm	O

hm	O

hm	O

hm	O

hm	O
well	O
i	O
'm	O
just	O
thanking	O
heaven	O

my	O
husband	O
just	O
got	O
a	O
new	O
job	O

his	O
last	O
company	O
he	O
was	O
only	O
working	O
four	O
days	O
a	O
week	O

so	O
it	O
's	O

and	O
he	O
just	O
got	O
a	O
new	O
job	O

he	O
's	O
getting	O
lots	O
of	O
overtime	O

he	O
got	O
a	O
pay	O
raise	O

and	BE_IP
so	C
i	O
'm	O
just	O
grateful	O
that	O
we	BE_IP
do	C
n't	C
have	C
to	C
worry	O
so	O
much	O
about	O
my	O
working	O
or	O
not	O

i	O
suppose	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
start	O
wondering	O
if	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O

yes	O

hm	O

um	O
i	O
have	O
one	O

but	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
had	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
her	O
about	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
while	O

um-hum	O

this	O
is	O
true	O

current	O
affair	O
can	O
get	O
several	O
shows	O
with	O
those	O
cases	O

okay	O

well	O
i	O
'll	O
just	O
briefly	O

um	O
i	O
worked	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
know	O
from	O
way	O
back	O
uh	O
how	O
things	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
run	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
's	O
been	O
definite	O
changes	O
of	O
nursing	O
homes	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
if	O
i	O
personally	O
had	O
to	O
put	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
parents	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
bad	O
off	O
to	O
where	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
all	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
something	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
would	O
certainly	O

if	O
they	O
're	O
forgetting	O
things	O
or	O
whatever	O
i	O
'd	O
prefer	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
at	O
home	O
or	O
have	O
them	BE
in	IP
what	C
they	C
call	O
now	O
home	O
care	O
where	O
somebody	O
comes	O
in	O

and	O
they	O
cook	O
meals	O

and	O
they	O
clean	O
their	O
house	O
for	O
them	O

that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

so	O
they	O
still	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
independence	O

and	O
not	O
reliable	O
you	O
know	O

they	BE
do	IE
n't	IE
have	IE
to	IP
be	C
in	C
a	C
nursing	O
home	O
situation	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O

the	O
nursing	O
homes	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
working	O
in	O
them	BE_IP
were	C
very	O
much	O
understaffed	O
very	O
much	O
uh	O
in	O
need	O
of	O
good	O
personnel	O
um	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
patients	O
were	O
n't	O
given	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
care	O
that	O

i	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
and	O
say	O
thank	O
god	O

i	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
situation	O

but	O
uh	O
they	BE_IP
they	C_IP
were	C
not	O
given	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
given	O
the	O
money	O
basically	O
to	O
staff	O
appropriately	O
people	O
to	O
help	O

and	O
i	O
can	O
remember	O
lifting	O
a	O
patient	O
all	O
by	O
myself	O
simply	O
because	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
another	O
person	O
to	O
help	O

it	O
's	O
either	O
let	O
leave	O
the	O
patient	O
in	O
bed	O
all	O
day	O
long	O
or	O
get	O
them	O
up	O

and	O
i	O
would	O
have	O
preferred	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
up	O
than	O
-an	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
in	O
bed	O
all	O
day	O

but	BE_IP
uh	C
um	C
so	C
i	O
think	O
nursing	O
homes	O
are	O
have	O
changed	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
quite	O
sure	O

but	O
hopefully	O
they	O
have	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

sure	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

yeah	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
can	C
happen	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
that	O
i	O
worked	O
for	O

i	O
was	O
n't	O
quite	O
sure	O
of	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
patients	O
were	O
uh	O
given	O
medication	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
uh	O
quiet	O

and	BE_IP
and	C

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
they	O
would	O
just	O
lay	O
all	O
day	O
long	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
ones	O
tha-	O

they	O
also	O
put	O
mentally	O
ill	O
patients	O
in	O
the	O
same	O

they	O
were	O
not	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
you	O
know	O
ward	O

but	O
they	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
that	O
these	O
mentally	O
ill	O
patients	O
could	O
walk	O
into	O
where	O
the	O
other	O
uh	O
older	O
people	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
there	O
for	O
reasons	O
of	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
age	O
uh	O

the	O
mentally	O
ill	O
patients	O
could	O
walk	O
right	O
in	O
into	O
the	O
rooms	O
or	O
do	O
whatever	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
basically	O

because	O
if	O
you	O
were	O
n't	O
there	O
to	O
watch	O
them	O
and	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
wing	O
they	BE
could	IP
they	C
had	C
freedom	O
to	O
just	O
walk	O
around	O

and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
couple	O
that	O
were	O
schizophrenic	O

and	O
i	O
remember	O
one	O
time	O
watching	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
uh	O
schizophrenic	O
patients	O
actually	O
go	O
out	O
on	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
it	O
a	O
binge	O
or	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
it	O
but	O
she	O
grabbed	O
a	O
hold	O
of	O
this	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
funny	O
when	O
i	O
look	O
back	O
at	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
remember	O
the	O
patient	O
getting	O
very	O
upset	O

that	O
p-	O
woman	O
actually	O
pulled	O
uh	O
the	O
other	O
person	O
's	O
hair	O

i	O
mean	O
she	O
just	O
came	O
up	O
right	O
behind	O
him	O
and	O
pulled	O
his	O
hair	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
guy	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
really	O
upset	O

i	O
mean	O
he	BE
's	IE
what	IE
the	IE
hell	IP
are	C
you	C
think	C
you	C
're	C
doing	O
you	O
know	O

and	BE_IP
i	C
laughed	O
at	O
it	O
then	O

but	BE_IP
then	C
i	O
'm	O
thinking	O
god	O
you	O
know	O

if	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
put	O
my	O
parents	O
in	O
that	O
nursing	O
home	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
them	O
there	O

so	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
's	O
laws	O
now	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
protect	O
that	O
nursing	O
homes	O
either	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
mentally	O
ill	O
totally	O
away	O
from	O
these	O
people	O
and	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
type	O
of	O
facilities	O

even	O
though	O
they	O
're	O
aging	O
mentally	O
ill	O
they	O
are	O
still	O
mentally	O
ill	O

and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
these	O
older	O
people	O
have	O
their	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
insane	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
these	O
tendencies	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
lash	O
out	O

but	O
seeing	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
made	O
me	O
think	O
twice	O
about	O

jeez	O

i	O
would	O
n't	O
put	O
my	O
mother	O
father	O
in	O
that	O
nursing	O
home	O
at	O
all	O

a	O
small	O
town	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
this	O
way	O

i	O
think	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
big	O
city	O
area	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
's	O
more	O
people	O
to	O
keep	O
watch	O
on	O
it	O

and	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
more	O
competition	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
nursing	O
homes	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
when	O
there	O
's	O
one	O
nursing	O
home	O
for	O
a	O
whole	O
community	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
back	O
in	O
nineteen	O
seventy	O
seven	O
that	O
i	O
worked	O
there	O
and	O
i	O
look	O
back	O
at	O
it	O
and	O
say	O
jeez	O
you	O
know	O

i	BE_IP
it	C
would	C
have	O
to	O
be	O
awfully	O
bad	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
put	O
my	O
parents	O
in	O
there	O

but	O
my	O
grandmother	O
uh	O
later	O
on	O
got	O
cancer	O
and	O
uh	O
could	O
no	O
longer	O

well	O
actually	O
she	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
the	BE_IP
i	C
guess	C
i	C
have	O
n't	O
had	O
that	O
much	O
experience	O

i	O
've	O
only	O
seen	O
like	O
my	O
great	O
grandparents	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
but	O
i	O
have	O
an	O
aunt	O
who	O
lived	O
on	O
her	O
own	O
-til	O
she	O
was	O
well	O
in	O
her	O
nineties	O
and	O
then	BE
she	IP
she	C
got	C
sick	O

and	O
she	O
ended	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
and	O
my	O
parents	O
went	O
to	O
visit	O
her	O

and	O
it	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
the	O
nur-	O
it	O
seemed	O
like	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
her	O
anymore	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
gave	O
her	O
drugs	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O
asleep	O

nice	O
sedative	O
state	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

be	O
violent	O

was	O
this	O
in	O
a	O
big	O
town	O
or	O
a	O
little	O
town	O

oh	O
really	O

it	O
seem	O
like	O
the	O
small	O
town	O
nursing	O
homes	O
i	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
personal	O
attention	O

uh-huh	O

you	O
have	O
more	O
options	O

uh-huh	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O

uh	O

oh	O
i	O
can	O
be	O

but	O
go	O
ahead	O

right	O

right	O

we	O
fax	O
everything	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
mail	O
anymore	O

right	O

right	O

um-hum	O

right	O

right	O

you	O
're	O
expected	O
to	O

exactly	O

and	O
i	O
recently	O
read	O
an	O
article	O
on	O
just	O
this	BE_IP
that	C
said	O
stress	O
today	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
worse	O

it	O
should	O
be	O
less	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
microwave	O

and	O
our	O
grandmother	O
's	O
had	O
to	O
bake	O
brownies	O

and	O
we	O
can	O
throw	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
microwave	O
for	O
two	O
minutes	O

but	O
the	O
more	O
conveniences	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
more	O
that	O
's	O
expected	O
of	O
us	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
downtime	O

like	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
stop	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
things	O
to	O
happen	O
because	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O

so	O
we	O
keep	O
moving	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
stop	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
things	O
to	O
bake	O
and	O
this	O
to	O
happen	O
and	O
that	O
to	O
happen	O

we	O
just	O
hit	O
buttons	O
and	O
keep	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
thing	O

so	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
relaxation	O
time	O
in	O
between	O
so	O
they	O
say	O
that	O
's	O
really	O
a	O
bad	O
thing	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
learn	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
ways	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
deal	O
with	O
that	O
and	O
get	O
your	BE_IP
your	C
time	O
in	O
between	O
things	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

that	O
's	O
an	O
interesting	O
point	O

but	O
i	O
just	O
think	O
our	BE_IP
our	C
family	O
lives	O
have	O
changed	O
drastically	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
jus-	O

of	O
course	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
technology	O

i	O
mean	O
our	O
kids	O
where	O
would	O
they	O
be	O
without	O
nintendo	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
their	O
t._v.	O
shows	O

and	O
that	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
that	O
is	O
really	O

yeah	O

well	O
you	O

it	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
just	O
garbage	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
i	O
'm	O
concerned	O
you	O

but	O
i	O
just	O
like	O
the	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
daily	O
news	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
uh	O
especially	O
the	O
weather	O

i	O
like	O
that	O

although	O
they	O
're	O
usually	O
wrong	O

uh-huh	O

but	O
uh	O
like	O
i	O
say	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
that	O
's	O
actually	O
listening	O
to	O
the	O
news	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
t._v.	O
five	O
o'clock	O
to	O
six	O
thirty	O

oh	O
that	O
seems	O
like	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
for	O
news	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
long	O
it	O
is	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
seems	C
like	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
local	O
news	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
world	O
news	O

and	O
then	O
uh	O
my	O
morning	O
paper	O
i	O
can	O
hardly	O
wait	O
for	O
it	O
to	O
come	O

and	O
um	O

oh	O

yeah	O

right	O

once	O
you	O

's	O
why	O
i	O
watch	O

at	O
five	O
o'clock	O

but	O
anyhow	O
well	O

oh	O
really	O

i	O
was	O
born	O
and	O
raised	O
in	O
uh	O
near	O
miami	O
and	O
uh	O
spent	O
the	O
last	O
twenty	O

in	O

uh	O
where	O
the	O

and	O
uh	O
for	O
the	O

uh	O
what	O

the	O

i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C
do	O
my	O
duty	O
and	O
watch	O
the	O

on	O
uh	O
the	O

have	O
to	O
sports	O

um-hum	O

well	O
yeah	O

sure	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
uh	O
san	O
francisco	O
giants	O
and	O
the	O
oakland	O
a.	O
's	O
were	O
like	O
the	O
leading	O
teams	O
a	O
couple	O
years	O

well	O
i	O
thin-	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

we-	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
sort	O
of	O
what	O
i	O
gather	O

um	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

what	O
is	O
the	O
prognosis	O
for	O
uh	O
this	O
year	O

oh	O
good	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
assume	O
that	O
means	O
good	O
for	O
the	O
minnesota	O

yep	O

i	O
think	O
a	O
train	O
went	O
by	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
a	O
train	O
went	O
by	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
noise	O
was	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
probably	O
was	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
train	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP

as	O
the	O
uh	O
san	O
francisco	O
giants	O
and	O
the	O
oakland	O
a.	O
's	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
both	O
won	O
their	O
opener	O

i	O
sort	O
of	O
gathered	O
that	O
in	O
my	O
uh	O
subliminal	O
memory	O

hm	O

um-hum	O

i	O
guess	O
they	O
're	O
in	O

is	O
that	O
right	O

the	O
a.	O
's	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

eighty	O

that	O
was	O
the	O

i	O
do	O

you	BE_IP
you	C

all	O
that	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
i	O

okay	O

oh	O
really	O

okay	O

well	BE_IP
well	C
i-	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
know	O
uh	O
the	O

actually	O
i	BE
'm	IE

like	C
i	C

i	C
'm	C
in	C
minneapolis	O

and	O
the	O
big	O
thing	O
up	O
here	O
of	O

is	O
the	O
twins	O

um	O

no	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
pretty	O
pervasive	O

it	O
kind	O
of	O
goes	O
into	O
about	O
all	O
aspects	O
of	O
society	O
i	O
think	O
up	O
here	O

but	O
um	O
actually	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
series	O
you	O
caught	O
last	O
year	O

but	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun	O

well	O
to	O
be	O
honest	O
with	O
you	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
from	O
minneapolis	O

in	O

i	O
've	O

a	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
exactly	O
a	O
real	O

from	O

or	O
anything	O

but	O

oh	O
yeah	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

oh	O
okay	O

y-	BE_IP
yeah	C

i	O
have	O
n't	O
followed	O
it	O
real	O
closely	O
at	O
all	O

um	O
except	O
like	O
i	O
said	O
last	O
year	O
when	O
the	O
world	O
series	O
rolled	O
around	O
i	BE
did	IP
i	C
did	C
follow	O
that	O
pretty	O
religiously	O

went	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
bars	O
you	O
know	O
drank	O
a	O
beer	O
watched	O
the	O
game	O
sat	O
a	BE
gir-	IP
a	C
good	C
time	O
that	O
way	O

but	O
uh	O

is	O
that	O
right	O

um-hum	O

uh	O
real	O
good	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
i	O
can	O
tell	O

people	O
are	O
pretty	O
excited	O
about	O

well	O
yeah	O

sorry	O
about	O
that	O

yeah	O

uh	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
twins	O
are	O
concerned	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
real	O
good	O

um	O
my	O
roommate	O
went	O
and	O
saw	O
them	O
play	O
um	O
their	O
season	O
opener	O
uh	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
nights	O
ago	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
won	O
that	O
one	O
seven	O
to	O
one	O

so	O
um	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
i	O
guess	O

it	O
looks	O
like	O
they	O
'll	O
be	O
doing	O
pretty	O
well	O

are	O
you	O
still	O
there	O

okay	O

i	O
heard	O
some	O
noise	O
on	O
the	O
line	O

did	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
happened	O

oh	O
okay	O

all	O
right	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
maybe	O
that	O
has	O
has	O
good	O
tidings	O
for	BE
their	IP
uh	C
for	C
their	C
season	O
coming	O
up	O

i	O
've	O
actually	O
got	O
a	O
friend	O
that	O
's	O
living	O
in	O
san	O
francisco	O
right	O
now	O

uh	O
he	O
's	O
doing	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
i	O
'm	O
doing	O
which	O
is	O
basically	O
uh	O
an	O
internship	O

we	O
were	O
both	O
doctoral	O
students	O

and	O
he	O
's	O
doing	O
his	O
with	O
i._b._m.	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
doing	O
mine	O
with	O
honeywell	O

but	O
um	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
he	O
kind	O
of	O
follows	O
the	O
sports	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
he	BE
's	IE
mentioned	IP
um	C
the	C
oakland	C
a.	C
's	C
a	O
couple	O
times	O

uh	O
he	O
may	O
have	O
watched	O
them	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
good	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
i	O
know	O

yeah	O

and	BE_IP
in	C_IE
the	C_IE
major	C_IE
leagues	C_IP
i	C
guess	C
there	C
's	C
a	O
couple	O
of	O
different	O
divisions	O

and	O
then	O
of	O
course	O
there	O
's	O
the	O
minors	O

um	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
guess	O
i	O
'm	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
that	BE_IP
if	C
i	O
really	O
made	O
a	O
concentrated	O
effort	O
i	O
could	O
really	O
probably	O
get	O
into	O
baseball	O

um	O
but	O
i	O
was	O
talking	O
to	O
my	O
roommate	O
a	O
couple	O
nights	O
ago	O
right	O
after	O
that	O
game	O

and	O
he	BE_IP
offered	C
you	C
know	C
to	C
take	O
me	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
games	O
because	O
apparently	O
he	O
'd	O
bought	O
uh	O
he	O
and	O
four	O
other	O
people	O
from	O
honeywell	O
had	O
bought	BE
a	IE
seat	IP
or	C
a	C
row	C
of	C
seats	O
actually	O
for	O
the	O
home	O
games	O

but	O
th-	BE_IP
the	C
thing	O
is	BE_IP
there	C
's	C
like	O
eighty	O
six	O
home	O
games	O
per	O
year	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
no	O
way	O
you	O
can	O
ever	O
use	O
them	O
all	O

eighty	O
six	O

i	O
was	O
amazed	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
the	O
home	O
games	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
thought	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
mistake	O

but	O
he	O
goes	O
no	O

see	O
eight	O
yeah	O

well	O
j-	O
just	O
about	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
that	BE
's	IP
you	C
know	C
yeah	C
that	C
's	C
almost	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
baseball	O

well	O
you	BE_IP
you	C_IP
if	C_IE
you	C_IP
if	C
you	C
consider	O
it	BE_IP
the	C
season	O
starts	O

well	O
it	O
's	O

the	O
season	O
started	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
ago	O

and	O
it	O
ends	O
with	O
the	O
world	O
series	O
which	O
usually	O
takes	O
place	O
i	O
believe	O
in	O
december	O
or	O
january	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
so	O

it	O
did	O
last	O
wee-	O
year	O
did	O
n't	O
it	O

or	O
was	O
it	O
november	O

maybe	O
it	O
was	O
november	O
i	O
'm	O
thinking	O
about	O

i	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
doggone	O
cold	O
up	O
here	O

um	O

well	O
i	O
know	O
for	O
sure	O
it	O
was	O

i	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
after	O
september	O

because	O
that	O
's	O
when	O
i	O
got	O
up	O
here	O

and	O
i-	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
months	O
after	O
i	O
got	O
up	O
here	O

yeah	O

so	O
it	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
november	O
anyway	O

okay	O

do	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
budget	O
that	O
you	O
go	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
my	O
bills	O
i	O
usually	O
know	O
approximately	O
how	O
much	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

each	O
month	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
just	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
you	O
know	O

uh	O
very	O
seldom	O
are	O
they	O
any	O
different	O

and	O
then	O
uh	O
like	O
for	O
groceries	O
and	O
everything	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
put	O
like	O
two	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
dollars	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
can	O
in	O
the	O
kitchen	O
and	O
then	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
we	O
use	O
to	O
buy	O
the	O
groceries	O
with	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
put	O
our	O
receipts	O
in	O
there	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
usually	O
that	O
's	O
enough	O

and	BE_IP
um	C
but	C
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
you	O
know	O
small	O
children	O
to	O
have	O
anything	O
extra	O
come	O
up	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
uh	O
running	O
to	O
the	O
doctor	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
with	O
them	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

right	O

in	O
fact	O
i	O
did	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
dog	O
to	O
the	O
vet	O
the	O
other	O
day	O

yeah	O

that	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
worse	O
than	O
having	O
a	O
kid	O
huh	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O

worked	O
for	O
p.	O
i	O
e.	O

and	O
then	O
uh	O

went	O
bankrupt	O

so	O
i	O
just	O
went	O
ahead	O
and	O
took	O
my	O
early	O
pension	O

but	O
i	O
only	O
get	O
that	O
once	O
a	O
month	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

so	O

yeah	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
budget	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
go	O
over	O
that	O
amount	O
you	O
know	O
each	O
month	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

right	O

um-hum	O

and	O

oh	O
yeah	O

right	O
now	O
it	O
's	O
terrible	O
is	O
n't	O
it	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
also	O
like	O
belong	O
to	O
a	O
christmas	O
club	O
be-	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
belong	O
to	O
a	O
christmas	O
club	O

last	O
year	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O

then	O
so	O
then	O
naturally	O
christmas	O
comes	O
along	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
puts	O
you	O
behind	O
too	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
this	O
year	O
now	O

dollars	O
a	O
month	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
checking	O
account	O
for	O
my	O
christmas	O

's	O
going	O
to	O
help	O
some	O

yeah	O

right	O
you	O
know	O

lessons	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
learn	O
how	O
to	O
sew	O
better	O
than	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
learned	O
everything	O
to	O

i	O
figure	O
that	O
will	O
help	O
me	O
save	O
you	O
know	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
see	O
some	O

some	IE

and	O
none	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
write	O
down	O
all	O
my	O
bills	O
how	O
much	O
i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
it	O
per	O
paycheck	O
for	O
me	O
which	O
is	O
every	O
other	O
week	O

uh	O
i	O

car	O
payments	O
to	O
credit	O
card	O
payments	O
you	O
know	O
everything	O

and	O
it	O
tends	O
to	O
work	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O
that	O
way	O

i	O
can	O
anticipate	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
little	O
better	O

i	O
usually	O
try	O
to	O
guesstimate	O

and	O
then	O
when	O
the	O
bill	O
actually	O
comes	O
in	O
i	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
fill	O
in	O
the	O
actual	O
amount	O

that	O
way	O
i	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
pocket	O
change	O
i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
left	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
month	O
or	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
paycheck	O
anyway	O

so	O
that	O
works	O
okay	O
for	O
me	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

same	O
here	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O
oh	O
okay	O

um-hum	O

right	O

luckily	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
either	O

i	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
maybe	O
my	O
cat	O
would	O
get	O
sick	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
usually	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
throw	O
me	O
off	O

but	O
you	BE
so	IP
you	C
know	C
what	C
i	C
'm	C
saying	O

yeah	O

i	O

sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
be	O

sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
be	O

i	O
guess	O
the	O
worst	O
thing	O
i	O
've	O
ever	O
had	O
come	O
out	O
is	O
like	O
car	O
maintenance	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
try	O
to	O
build	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
extra	O
money	O
each	O
month	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O

so	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
uh-huh	O

ooh	O
that	O
's	O
tough	O

my	O
roommate	O
only	O
gets	O
paid	O
once	O
a	O
month	O

and	O
that	O
last	O
week	O
's	O
pretty	O
lean	O
generally	O
speaking	O

so	O

right	O

i	O
for	O
for	O
years	O
got	O
paid	O
once	O
a	O
month	O

and	O
and	O
in	O
ways	O
i	O
liked	O
it	O
because	O
i	O
could	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
pay	O
all	O
my	O
bills	O
at	O
once	O

there	O
's	O
always	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
stragglers	O
that	O
usually	O
they	O
were	O

for	O
me	O
it	O
worked	O
out	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
smaller	O
ones	O
but	O
i	O
would	O
pay	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
one	O
sitting	O

and	O
i	O
would	O
know	O
okay	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
spend	O
this	O
much	O
on	O
groceries	O
now	O
and	O
you	O
get	O
this	O
much	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
it	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
that	O
worked	O
okay	O
for	O
me	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

right	O
now	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
in	O
the	O
mode	O
of	O
trying	O
to	O
dig	O
out	O
of	O
debt	O
i	O
think	O
as	O
everybody	O
is	O

and	O
so	O

it	BE
's	IP
yeah	C
it	C
's	C
really	O
bad	O

but	O
um	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
pretty	O
well	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
real	BE_IP
good	C
plan	O
mapped	O
out	O
here	O

so	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O

yeah	O

that	O
'll	O
cover	O
your	O
gifts	O
come	O
christmas	O
time	O

that	O
'll	O

yeah	O

that	O
'd	O
be	O
good	O

because	O
yeah	O

most	O
people	O
are	O
spending	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
months	O
di-	O
you	O
know	O
at	O
least	O
digging	O
out	O
after	O
christmas	O

so	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
was	O
pretty	O
fortunate	O
this	O
christmas	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
in	O
debt	O

so	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
uh-huh	O

it	O
's	O
so	O
rare	O

you	O
hear	O
anybody	O
doing	O
that	O
any	O
longer	O

yeah	O

my	O
um	O
roommate	O
does	O
sew	O
some	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
um	O
i	O
she	O
has	O
n't	O
sewed	O
anything	O
in	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
sure	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O
again	O

my	O
mother	O
always	O
sewed	O

she	O
tried	O
to	O
teach	O
me	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
young	O
but	O
not	O
interested	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
real	O
good	O
way	O
to	O
save	O
money	O
though	O
by	O
doing	O
that	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
make	O
a	O
little	O
extra	O
money	O

well	O
this	O
is	O
another	O
way	O
that	O
i	O
'm	O
making	O
a	O
little	O
extra	O
money	O

so	O
that	O
was	O
you	O
know	O
nice	O
that	O
i	O
tripped	O
over	O
this	O
opportunity	O

and	O
you	O
're	O
actually	O
my	O
first	O
call	O

yeah	O

i	O
had	O
not	O
um	O
done	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
guess	O
today	O
's	O
today	O
's	O
my	O
first	O
day	O
that	O
i	O
could	O
even	O
do	O
it	O

yeah	O

you	O
beat	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
punch	O
here	O

i	BE
was	IP
i	C
was	C
about	O
to	O
call	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
i	O
could	O
get	O
on	O
with	O
somebody	O

so	BE_IP
so	C
that	O
was	O
great	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
take	O
have	O
some	O
money	O
taken	O
out	O
and	O
put	O
in	O
a	O
401k	O

why	O
do	O
n't	O
you	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
start	O

so	O
you	O
think	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
trials	O
were	O
held	O
by	O
judges	O
or	O
experts	O
that	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
would	O
tend	O
not	O
to	O
uh	O
admit	O
or	O
not	O
to	O
convict	O
people	O
on	O
circumstantial	O
evidence	O

you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
attended	O
a	O
trial	O
in	BE_IP
uh	C
in	C
germany	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
a	O
student	O

and	O
uh	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
system	O
they	O
have	O

the	O
trials	O
are	O
held	O
by	O
a	O
panel	O
of	O
three	O
uh	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
judges	O
who	O
are	O
well	O

they	O
're	O
like	O
lawyers	O
i	O
guess	O

they	O
're	O
experts	O
in	O
the	O
law	O
and	O
uh	O
there	O
there	O
really	O
is	O
n't	O
a	O
jury	O

and	O
uh	O
uh	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
questioning	O
also	O

the	O
judges	O
do	O
the	O
questioning	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O

uh	O
it	O
's	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
harder	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
on	O
technicalities	O
also	O
because	O
they	O
uh	O
uh	O
the	O
judge	O
is	O
also	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
jury	O
uh	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
i	O
like	O
that	O

i	BE
think	IP
i	C
prefer	C
the	O
jury	O
system	O
myself	O

uh	O
well	O
actually	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
most	O
criminal	O
cases	O
it	O
would	O
n't	O
make	O
any	O
difference	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
a	BE_IP
couple	C
of	C
judges	O
or	O
a	O
jury	O

what	BE
i	IP
what	C
i	C
worry	O
about	O
is	O
cases	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
government	O
against	O
the	O
individual	O

that	O
's	O
where	O
you	O
really	O
need	O
a	O
jury	O
of	O
peers	O
because	O
uh	O
anytime	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
government	O
um	O
is	O
the	O
government	O
against	O
the	O
individual	O
you	BE
need	IE
some	IE
k-	IP
yeah	C
they	C
need	C
the	O
protection	O
of	O
ordinary	O
citizens	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
really	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
guess	O
where	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
s-	BE_IP
system	C
change	O
is	O
uh	O
um	O
there	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
uh	O
um	O
well	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
um	O
juries	O
need	O
to	O
decide	O
sentencing	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

i	O
think	O
maybe	O
the	BE_IP
a	C
judge	O
is	O
a	O
better	O
judge	O
of	O
that	O

or	O
um	O

yeah	O

well	O
if	O
you	O
drag	O
twelve	O
people	O
into	O
a	O
courtroom	O
i	O
trust	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
right	O
decision	O
as	O
to	O
whether	O
someone	O
's	O
guilty	O
or	O
innocent	O

that	O
's	O
usually	O
a	O
matter	BE
of	IP
who	C
to	C
believe	O
and	O
what	O
facts	O
to	O
believe	O

but	O
people	O
who	BE
do-	IP
who	C
do	C
n't	C
have	O
day	O
in	O
and	O
day	O
out	O
life	O
long	O
experience	O
with	BE_IP
what	C
prison	O
's	O
really	O
like	O
and	O
what	O
the	O
options	O
are	O
to	O
ask	O
them	O
to	O
decide	O
for	O
one	O
case	O
on	O
one	O
person	O
based	O
on	O
what	O
they	O
see	O
i	O
think	O
that	BE_IP
is	C
maybe	O
uh	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
naive	O

in	O
texas	O
here	O
people	O
tend	O
to	O
get	O
whipped	O
up	O
into	O
a	O
frenzy	O
and	O
slap	O
long	O
sentences	O
on	O
people	O

um	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
um	O
hanging	O
jury	O
atmosphere	O

but	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
places	O
i	O
think	O
people	O
bend	O
over	O
the	O
other	O
way	O

but	O
i	BE
guess	IP
i	C
guess	C
i	O
like	O
the	O
system	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
where	O
the	O
defendant	O
gets	O
to	O
choose	O
whether	O
he	O
's	O
goes	O
before	O
a	O
jury	O
for	O
sentencing	O
or	O
whether	O
the	O
judge	O
gets	O
to	O
choose	O
it	O

some	O
ca-	O
some	O
cases	O
in	O
some	O
jurisdictions	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
that	O
system	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

right	O

and	O
lawyers	O
blow	O
sand	O
in	O
their	O
eyes	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
most	O
civil	O
cases	O
tried	O
before	O
a	BE_IP
panel	C
of	C
experts	O
instead	O
of	O
ordinary	O
juries	O

insurance	O
cases	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

where	O

and	O
um	O
there	O
'd	O
be	O
more	O
honest	O
settlements	O
instead	O
of	O
this	O
um	O
uh	O
tugging	O
of	O
people	O
's	O
heart	O
strings	O
and	O
um	O
making	O
them	O
cry	O
and	O
feel	O
like	O
they	O
're	O
doing	O
somebody	O
good	O
by	O
giving	O
them	BE_IP
or	C
giving	O
them	O
two	O
million	O
dollars	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
pain	O
and	O
suffering	O

so	O
in	BE_IP
i	C_IE
think	C_IE
in	C_IP
in	C
criminal	O
trials	O
you	O
need	O
the	O
jury	O
as	O
a	O
defense	O
against	O
the	O
government	O

but	O
in	O
civil	O
trials	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O

okay	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
court	O
systems	O
could	O
stand	O
some	O
improvement	O

uh	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
is	O
good	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
it	O
i-	BE_IP
in	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cases	O
uh	O
is	O
circumstantial	O
evidence	O
that	O
that	O
convicts	O
a	O
person	O
which	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
is	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
good	O
because	O
sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
get	O
all	O
the	O
facts	O
and	O
to	O
prove	O
a	O
person	O
innocent	O
i	O
mean	O
prove	O
a	O
person	O
guilty	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
or	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
have	O
a	O
eyewitness	O

and	O
how	O
can	O
you	O
convict	O
somebody	O
on	O
circumstantial	O
evidence	O
is	O
beyond	O
me	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
so	O

um-hum	O

right	O

um-hum	O

you	O
think	O
you	O
prefer	O
the	O
jury	O

you	O
think	O
your	O
chances	O
are	O
better	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

um-hum	O

well	O
so-	BE_IP
sometimes	C
the	O
sentencing	O
is	O
still	O
is	O
not	O
fair	O

i	O
mean	O
even	O
if	O
well	O
the	O
jury	O
i	O
guess	O
they	O
do	O
decide	O
that	O

but	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
'm	O
like	O
you	O

in	O
a	O
case	O
like	O
that	O
most	O
time	O
its	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

maybe	O
i	O
'm	O
too	O
too	O
uh	O
uh	O
conservative	O
when	O
it	O
come	O
to	O
that	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
sentencing	O
is	O
really	O
light	O
compared	O
to	O
what	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cases	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O

right	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

right	O

oh	O
really	O

yeah	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
not	O
a	O
bad	O
system	O

but	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
think	O
it	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
shaken	O
up	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O

but	O
the	O
thing	O
is	O
too	O
maybe	O
they	O
need	O
more	O
of	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
expert	O
types	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
be	O
on	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
jury	O
cases	O
because	O
most	O
time	O
you	O
just	O
pick	O
you	O
know	O
joe	O
blow	O
or	O
whoever	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
citizen	O
or	O
whoever	O
an-	BE_IP
and	C
call	O
them	O
in	O

exactly	O

righ-	O
right	O

exactly	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O
putt-	O
putting	O
on	O
a	O
act	O
or	O
whatever	O

um-hum	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

um	O
taxes	O

you	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O

um-hum	O

i	O
agree	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
i	O
look	O
at	O
um	O
all	O
the	O
things	O
that	O

a	O

and	O
the	O

and	O
she	O
was	O
sitting	O
in	O
school	O
on	O
a	O
carpet	O

and	O
when	O
she	O
stood	O
up	O
it	O
caught	O
and	O
broke	O

and	O
we	O
took	O
it	O
back	O

and	O
they	O
said	O
oh	O
this	O
was	O
just	O
obviously	O
yanked	O

this	O
was	O
yanked	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
rude	O
about	O
it	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
wanted	O
a	O
different	O
kind	O
of	O
catch	O

and	O
she	O
said	O
well	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
guaranteed	O

and	O
i	O
said	O
well	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
because	O
apparently	O
nothing	O
's	O
guaranteed	O

so	O
do	O
it	O
anyway	O

so	O
we	O
got	O
the	O
kind	O
we	O
wanted	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
really	O
disappointed	O
with	O
that	O

i	O
felt	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
company	O
that	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
reliable	O
and	O
i	O
happened	O
to	O
need	O
a	O
birthday	O
present	O
for	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
friends	O

and	O
i	O
called	O
there	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
it	O

and	O
the	O
lady	O
was	O
very	O
nice	O

and	O
i	O
said	O
my	O
goodness	O

i	O
said	O
you	O
've	O
been	O
very	O
nice	O
what	O
's	O
your	O
name	O

and	O
she	O
told	O
me	O

and	O
i	O
said	O
well	O
i	O
really	O
appreciate	O
it	O

i	O
said	O
there	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
big	O
attitude	O
problem	O
in	O
that	O
store	O

and	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
she	O
was	O
the	O
assistant	O
manager	O

so	O

right	O

so	O
i	O
felt	O
kind	O
of	O
good	O
about	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
even	O
know	O
the	O
person	O
's	O
name	O
that	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
the	O
hard	O
time	O
or	O
anything	O
but	O
i	O
just	O
felt	O
like	O
well	O
at	O
least	O
i	O
did	O
something	O

maybe	O
they	O
'll	O
fix	O
it	O

they	O
might	O
work	O
on	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
i	O
find	O
attitudes	O
are	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O

service	O
is	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O

really	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
great	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
good	O

it	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
that	O

but	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
most	O
places	O
are	O

that	O
anymore	O

recently	O
i	O

i	O

about	O
um	O
about	O
a	O

um	O
i	O

a	O

from	O
some	O

one	O

these	O

which	O
actually	O
ended	O
up	O

after	O

even	O
you	O

our	O
cowboys	O
here	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

anybody	O
roots	O
differently	O

but	O
i	O

a	O
boyfriend	O
that	O
lives	O
in	O
fresno	O

and	O
he	BE_IP
is	C

l._a.	O
raiders	O

so	O

well	O

this	O
year	O
because	O
of	O
these	O
silly	O
raiders	O
that	O

little	O
more	O
than	O
i	O
used	O
to	O

i	O
never	O
knew	O
very	O
much	O
at	O
all	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
trying	O

yeah	O

so	O
i	O
should	O
n't	O
even	O
try	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

really	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
think	O
we	O
have	O
that	O
in	O
texas	O

but	O
we	O
might	O

do	O
we	O

i	O
mean	O
no	O

you	O
probably	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

nobody	O
talks	O
about	O
it	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
we	O
do	O

no	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
soccer	O
team	O
that	O
comes	O
and	O
goes	O

we	O
do	O
n't	BE_IP
even	C
have	O
that	O
very	O
much	O

so	O

um-hum	O

like	O
to	O
watch	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
to	O
watch	O
anything	O

so	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
annoys	O
me	O
when	O
people	O
just	O
lay	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
a	O
t._v.	O
and	O
watch	O
all	O
this	O
stuff	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
an	O
excuse	O
to	O
do	O
nothing	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
can	O
see	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
saying	O
about	O
the	O
male	O
bonding	O

and	O
the	O
guys	O
get	O
together	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
cool	O

that	O
's	O
fun	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
it	O
can	O
get	O
really	O
overdone	O

yeah	O

i	O
have	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
have	O

uh	O
no	O

actually	O
no	O

um	O
i	O
've	O
done	O
that	O
for	O
college	O
football	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

right	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
thing	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
in	O
high	O
school	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
every	O
football	O
game	O

and	O
well	O
i	O
twirled	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
did	O
n't	O

i	O
still	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
much	O
about	O
football	O
obviously	O

but	O
i	O
still	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
time	O
you	O
know	O
i	O

oh	O
so	O

well	O
it	O

let	O
's	O
put	O
it	O
this	O
way	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
the	O
new	O
england	O
patriots	O
up	O
here	O

so	O

they	O
've	O
had	O
some	O
serious	O
problems	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
couple	O
years	O

yeah	O

um	O
well	O
uh	O
partly	O
due	O
to	O
ownership	O

you	O
know	O
uh	O
victor	O
kiam	O
owned	O
the	O
uh	O
the	O
patriots	O
uh	O
for	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
years	O

and	O
he	O
always	O
had	BE
this	IP
uh	C
this	C
wonderful	O
quality	O
of	O
qua-	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
put	O
his	O
foot	O
in	O
his	O
mouth	O
every	O
time	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
say	O
something	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O
've	O
had	O
some	O
financial	O
problems	O
with	O
the	O
team	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O

and	O
it	O
recently	O
was	O
sold	O
to	O
uh	O
some	O
other	O
people	O

so	O
hopefully	O
this	O
ownership	O
can	O
set	O
up	O
new	O
direction	O
and	O
uh	O
keep	O
uh	O
the	O
patriots	O
in	O
the	O
new	O
england	O
area	O
anyways	O

oh	O
yeah	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
to	O
a	O
couple	O
o-	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
to	O
a	O
few	O
games	O
before	O

now	O
you	BE_IP
you	C_IE
're	C_IP
you	C
're	C
from	O
texas	O

so	O
you	O
've	O
got	O
two	O
football	O
teams	O
down	O
there	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
i	O

there	O
's	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
segregation	O
huh	O

wow	O

uh-huh	O

do	O
you	O

um-hum	O

do	O
you	O
follow	O
professional	O
sports	O
at	O
all	O

yeah	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
good	O
past	O
time	O
you	O
know	O

particularly	O
football	O

they	O
say	O
uh	O
i-	BE_IP
football	C
attracts	O
more	O
men	O
because	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
y-	C_IP
the	C_IP
you	C
see	O
the	O
the	O
physical	O
aggression	O
on	O
the	O
field	O

and	O
supposedly	O
psychologists	O
say	O
that	BE_IP
uh	C
that	C
um	O
men	O
take	O
out	O
their	O
frustrations	O
by	O
watching	O
football	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
get	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
guys	O

and	BE
they	IP
um	C
uh	C
and	C
they	C
have	O
a	O
good	O
time	O
and	O
everything	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
suppose	O
to	O
be	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
uh	O
male	O
bonding	O
and	BE
the	IP
and	C_IE
the	C_IP
uh	C
the	C
male	O
instincts	O
i	O
guess	O
or	O
something	O
about	O
uh	O

well	O
no	O

it	BE
's	IE
a	IP
it	C_IE
's	C_IE
good	C_IP
as	C
in	C
terms	C
of	BE_IP
in	C
terms	C
of	C
uh	C
of	C
a	C
contest	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O

i	O
personally	O
like	O
hockey	O
better	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
contact	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
contact	O
sport	O

it	O
has	O
the	O
speed	O

and	O
the	O
hand	O
eye	O
coordination	O

and	O
it	O
takes	O
a	O
certain	O
skill	O
to	O
play	O
hockey	O

not	O
everybody	O
can	O
play	O
hockey	O

so	O
we	O

and	O

that	O
's	O

we	O
're	O
a	O
big	O
hockey	O
area	O
up	O
here	O

as	O
well	O
as	BE_IP
you	C

what	O

no	O

there	O
's	O
no	O

there	O
's	O
no	O

there	O
's	O
no	O

in	O
in	O

it	O
just	O
it	O
's	O
yeah	O

i	O
think	O
though	BE_IP
that	C

is	O

so	O
diluted	O
now	O

like	O

you	O

yep	O

well	O
foot-	O

well	O
th-	BE_IP
the	C
question	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
the	O

and	BE_IP
um	C
one	C
of	O
the	O
things	O
i	O
thought	O
about	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
drunk	O
cases	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
having	O
that	O
especially	O
for	O

that	O
um	O

maybe	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
stiffer	O
penalties	O
for	O
those	O
people	O
who	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
and	O
again	O

um	O
so	O
that	O
um	O
a	O
judge	O
i	O
think	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
appropriate	O
person	O
to	O
uh	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
sentence	O
somebody	O
since	O
they	O
do	O
it	O
over	O

over	O
again	O
every	O

right	O

right	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

see	O
i	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O

um	O
one	O
thing	O
i	O
heard	O
was	BE_IP
this	C
where	O
they	O
have	O
instead	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
regular	O
court	O
they	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
mock	O

i	O

it	O
's	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
legal	O
and	O
everything	O

uh	O
you	O
go	O

and	O
you	O
present	O
your	O

the	O

you	O
're	O

right	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O
because	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
uh	O
the	O
jury	O
may	O
not	O
even	O
have	O
the	O
information	O
about	O
other	O
crimes	O
the	O
person	O
has	O
committed	O

uh	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
that	O
's	O
considered	O
to	O
prejudice	O
the	O
current	O
case	O
so	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
judge	O
you	O
're	O
right	O
should	O
have	O
the	O
whole	O
dossier	O
of	O
the	O
criminal	O
there	O

and	O
if	BE_IP
they	C
're	C
judged	O
guilty	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
better	O
pri-	O
position	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
appropriate	O
uh	O
sentencing	O

um-hum	O

in	O
other	O
words	O
not	O
not	O

there	O
would	O
be	O
some	O
types	O
of	O
crimes	O
for	O
which	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
guaranteed	O
a	O
jury	O
trial	O

i-	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O

uh	O
th-	BE_IP
there	C
's	C
a	O
point	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
agree	O

i	O
would	O
tend	O
myself	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
continue	O
to	O
guarantee	O
a	O
jury	O
trial	O
for	O
criminal	O
cases	O
anytime	O
a	O
anytime	O
a	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
parties	O
wants	O
one	O

and	O
i	O
usually	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
defendant	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
wants	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
jury	O
hear	O
the	O
case	O

so	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
not	O
out	O
for	O
streamlining	O
things	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
we	O
uh	O
take	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

that	O
would	O
require	O
a	O
change	O
in	O
the	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	O
i	O
believe	O

and	O
so	O

oh	O
oh	O
okay	O

right	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
ready	O
possible	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
waive	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
a	O
jury	O
trial	O
uh	O

yeah	O
so	O
i	O
agree	O
that	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
encouraged	O

you	O
know	O
people	O
should	O
know	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
option	O
just	O
in	O
case	O
they	O
feel	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
jury	O
trial	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
most	O
lawyers	O
do	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
job	O
of	O
making	O
that	O
evident	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
clients	O
unless	O
they	O
feel	O
they	O
can	O
you	O
know	O
tweak	O
a	O
jury	O
into	O
per-	O
giving	O
a	O
different	O
sentence	O
or	O
possibly	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
civil	O
case	O
giving	O
higher	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
awards	O
of	O
money	O
or	O
something	O
since	O
usually	O
the	O
lawyers	O
get	O
a	O
percentage	O
of	BE_IP
the	C_IP
the	C
award	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
suspect	O
it	O
in	O
cases	O
like	O

i	O
guess	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
criminals	O
though	O
rather	O
than	O
civil	O

is	O
that	O
right	O

yeah	O

well	O
uh	O
um	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
c-	O
civil	O
uh	O
things	O
i	O
think	O
maybe	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
use	O
of	O
the	O
jury	O
is	O
very	O
often	O
to	O
the	O
lawyer	O
's	O
advantage	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
where	O
jury	O
use	O
is	O
overdone	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
mean	O
there	O
are	O
cases	O
where	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
settled	O
maybe	O
out	O
of	O
court	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
efficiently	O

but	O
the	O
lawyers	O
are	O
really	O
uh	O

it	O
's	O
to	O
their	O
advantage	O
to	O
play	O
to	O
as	O
big	O
an	O
audience	O
as	O
possible	O
so	O
uh	O
i	O
was	O
wondering	O
too	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
thinking	O
about	O
the	O
judge	O
making	O
awards	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
not	O
just	O
sentencing	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
a	O
criminal	O
cases	O

uh	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
so	O
sure	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
am	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
criminal	O
cases	O

so	O
there	BE
's	IE
a	IP
difference	C
of	C
my	O
view	O
there	O
for	O
those	O
two	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
had	O
to	O
serve	O
jury	O
duty	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i-	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O

sort	O
of	O
amazed	O
me	O
they	O
first	O
caught	O
up	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
uh	O

that	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
about	O
uh	O
twenty	O
years	O
too	O
um	O
uh	O
just	O
last	O
year	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
case	O
i	O
heard	O
was	O
a	O
criminal	O
case	O

and	O
it	O
seemed	O
it	O
really	O
trivial	O

it	O
involved	O
two	O
bicycles	O

we	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
the	O
sentencing	O

the	O
judge	O
did	O

so	O
we	O
'd	O
we	O
uh	O
rendered	O
a	O
verdict	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
judge	O
was	O
the	O
one	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
sentencing	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
here	O
in	O
wisconsin	O

so	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O

if	O
that	O

from	O

actually	O

a	O

uh	O

and	O
i	O

about	O
a	O

a	O

i	O

at	BE_IP
wo-	C_IP

uh	O
i	O

a	C

uh	O

and	O
i	O
in	O

the	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O

a	O

i	O

my	O

's	O

on	O
uh	O
a	O

uh	O
i	O
rented	O
an	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
pretty	O

yeah	O

it	BE_IP
uh	C_IE
well	C_IE
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
it	C_IE
's	C_IE
just	C_IP
it	C
was	C
just	O
a	O
completely	O

then	O

i	O
like	O
it	O

yeah	O

i	O
like	O
it	O
from	O
a	O
distance	O
really	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
see	O
the	O
packages	O
on	O
it	O
uh	BE_IP
that	C
are	C
available	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
nice	O

i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
use	O
it	O
myself	O

um	O
i	BE_IP
when	C
i	C
come	O
home	O
from	O
work	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
like	O
to	O
stay	O
far	O
away	O
from	O
computers	O
and	O
electronic	O
things	O

uh	O
so	O
i	O
let	O
my	O

do	O
it	O

and	O
uh	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
there	BE
's	IP
uh	C
there	C
's	C
an	O
intellectual	O
evolution	O
taking	O
place	O
where	O

i-	BE
i-	IP
it	C
's	C
sort	O
of	O
a	O
joke	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
true	O

the	O
old-timers	O
even	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
technologists	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
operate	O
these	O
electronic	O
things	O
like	O
v._c._r.	O
's	O
and	O
whatnot	O

and	O
the	O
kids	O
they	O
just	O
take	O
to	O
it	O
like	O
candy	O

oh	O
yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

i	BE
've	IP
i	C
'm	C
currently	O
in	O
school	O

so	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
had	O
an	O
i._b._m.	O
clone	O
i	O
guess	O
for	BE
a	IP
couple	C
of	C
years	O
now	O
which	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
trying	O
continually	O
upgrading	O
i	O
guess	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
've	O
found	O
i	O
've	O
found	O
that	O
i	O
pretty	O
much	O
become	O
addicted	O
to	O
it	O

and	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
really	O

i	O
've	O
found	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
homework	O
assignments	O
um	O
at	O
the	O
level	O
i	O
'm	O
at	O
really	O
require	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
computer	O
uh	O
simulation	O
or	O
analysis	O

so	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
pr-	O
very	O
essential	O
for	O
me	O

schools	O
have	O
them	O

um	O
but	BE_IP
lot	C
of	O
times	O
it	O
so	O
difficult	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
them	BE_IP
at	C
school	O

it	O
's	O
very	O
easy	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
much	O
more	O
convenient	O
to	O
have	O
one	O
at	O
home	O

at	O
georgia	O
tech	O

yeah	O

so	O

yes	O
actually	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
uh	O

um	O
sure	O

i	O
have	O
some	O
games	O
of	O
course	O
which	O
i	O
play	O
on	O
there	O

and	O
uh	O
um	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
program	O
which	O
allows	O
me	O
to	O
access	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
weather	O
data	O
bank	O

so	O
i	O
can	O
like	O
check	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
weather	O
around	O
the	O
country	O
or	O
whatever	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
hobby	O

so	O
i-	BE_IP
it	C
provides	O
other	O
means	O
other	O
than	O
just	O
strict	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
computations	O
and	O
so	O
on	O

so	O
have	BE
you	IP
do	C
you	C
have	O
a	O
computer	O
for	O
yourself	O
at	O
home	O

oh	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

tha-	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

do	O
you	O
use	O
e-mail	O
and	O
like	O
that	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C_IP
uh	C
i	C
have	O
a	O
modem	O
in	O
my	O

so	O
i	O
can	O
log	O
into	O
the	O
sys-	O
the	O
uh	O

at	O
georgia	O
tech	O
and	O
access	O
my	O

through	O
there	O
which	O
is	O
which	O
can	O
be	O
useful	O

but	O
um	O
yeah	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
and	C
word	O
processing	O
is	O

while	O
i	O
tend	O
to	O

i	O
mean	O
obviously	O
i	O
do	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
almost	O
all	O
of	O
my	O
report	O
writing	O
on	BE_IP
on	C
my	O

uh	O
whether	O
it	O
's	O
term	O
papers	O
or	O
even	O
some	O
smaller	O
homework	O
assignments	O

so	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C_IE
's	C_IE
really	C_IE
become	C_IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
know	C
really	C
-come	O
a	O
mainstay	O
i	O
guess	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
even	O
remember	O

actually	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
i	O
've	O
ever	O
used	O
a	O
typewriter	O
in	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
to	O
do	BE
a	IP
um	C
do	C
a	C
report	O
because	O
my	O
family	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
growing	O
up	O
we	O
got	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
basic	O
computer	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
t._r._s.	O
eighty	O
when	O
they	O
first	O
came	O
out	O

and	O
i	O
even	O
used	O
that	O
to	O
do	O
my	O
first	O
reports	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
junior	O
high	O

so	O

oh	O
yeah	O

oh	O

yeah	O

i-	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
tough	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
strange	O
for	O
me	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
did	O
my	O
master	O
's	O
thesis	O
uh	O
last	O
year	O

and	O
i	O
did	O
that	O
all	O
on	O
a	O
computer	O

and	O
it	O
s-	O
seems	O
like	O

i	O
just	O
ca	O
n't	O
imagine	O
how	O
people	O
did	O
it	O
before	O

it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
just	O
so	O
much	O
so	O
much	O
work	O

yeah	O

so	BE_IP
um	C
so	C
you	BE_IP
you	C_IP
you	C_IE
used	C_IP
uh	C
your	C
son	C
's	O
macintosh	O
then	O

uh	BE
do	IE
you	IP
do	C
you	C
find	O
it	O
do	O
you	O
like	O
that	O
s-	O
kind	O
of	O
computer	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

hm	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
if	C_IP
if	C_IE
th-	C_IP
if	C
the	O

is	O
there	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
fun	O
to	O
use	O
and	O
the	O
challenge	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
kids	O
tha-	O

okay	O

well	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
in	O
certain	O
cases	O
where	BE
it	IP
might	C
be	C
uh	O
somebody	O
's	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
that	O
uh	O
perhaps	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
lives	O
are	O

like	O
maybe	O
um	O
pilots	O
that	O
um	O
uh	O
you	O
you	O
know	O
fly	O

and	O
uh	O
maybe	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

over	O
a	O
large	O
mass	O
of	O
people	O

i	O
could	O
certainly	O
see	O
it	O
being	O
done	O

but	BE_IP
in	C
general	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
whether	O
companies	O

i	O

a	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
they	O

have	O

the	O
idea	O
that	O
let	O

them	O
and	O
let	O
's	O
put	O
them	O
through	O

there	O
's	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
a	O
limitation	O

do	O
we	O
drug	O
test	O
everybody	O
that	O
comes	O
in	O

or	O
do	O
we	O
kind	O
of	O
say	O
well	O
you	O
can	O
be	O
drug	O

and	O
you	O
look	O
okay	O

you	O

this	O

you	BE

you	C

and	BE_IP
and	C
there	O
's	O
just	O
no	O
way	O
that	O
we	O

that	O
you	O

the	O

that	O

uh	O
when	O

the	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
decision	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
dumb	O
decision	O
on	BE_IP
our	C

because	O
countries	O

do	O
perfectly	O

with	O
a	O
uh	O

for	BE

with	C
the	C

uh	O
i	O

that	BE

uh	C
that	C
's	C
the	O
way	O
the	O
americans	O

to	O
interpret	O
it	O

i	O

that	O

i	O

if	O

uh	O

when	O

the	O

that	O

you	BE

i	C
do	C

thi-	O
yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

i	BE
think	IE
in	IE

i	C

in	C

like	O
california	O
people	O
are	O
beginning	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
areas	O
that	O
are	O
fairly	O
well	O
off	O
if	O
you	O

that	O

um	C
um	C

a	O

i	O

to	BE_IP
be	C
willing	C
to	C
ante	O
up	O
for	O
the	O

they	O

right	O

yeah	O

people	O
would	O
rather	O
um	O
increase	O
the	O
fire	O

and	O
cut	O
down	O
the	O

because	O
it	O

i	O

i	O
hate	O
the	O
eight	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
percent	O
sales	O
tax	O

but	O
then	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
mind	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
only	O
on	O
you	O
know	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
n't	O
like	O
groceries	O
and	O
that	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
on	O
them	O

oh	O
yeah	O

they	O
do	O

in	O
arizona	O

um-hum	O

we	O
have	O
a	O
pretty	O
low	O
income	O
ta-	O
i	O
mean	O
pretty	O
low	O
tax	O
rate	O
here	O

oh	O
i	O
think	O
tha-	BE_IP
the	C
sales	C
tax	O
they	O
just	O
got	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
about	O
it	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
politicalness	O
of	O
trying	O
to	O
not	O
create	O
any	O
new	O
taxes	O

well	O
and	O
i	O
still	O
think	O
having	O
lived	O
in	O
europe	O
for	O
awhile	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
difference	O
in	O
living	O
conditions	O
are	O
certainly	O
well	O
worth	O
uh	O
what	O
we	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O

well	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
think	O

i	O
was	O
in	O
germany	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
several	O
years	O
and	O
i	BE
'd	IP
a	C
lot	C
rather	O
pay	O
taxes	O
here	O
and	O
have	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
than	O
have	O
to	O
live	O
there	O

higher	O
taxes	O

yeah	O

still	BE
is	IP
that	C
way	C
to	O
some	O
extent	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
other	O
problem	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
easy	O
to	O
complain	O
about	O
taxes	O
because	O
they	O
're	O
something	O
you	O
theoretically	O
can	O
do	O
something	O
about	O

but	O
i	O
look	O
for	O
example	O

and	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
're	C
not	O
in	O
the	O
quite	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
situation	O

but	O
like	O
school	O
taxes	O
for	O
me	O
biggest	O
bargain	O
in	O
the	O
world	O

i	O
wish	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
any	O
more	O
fo-	O
fo-	O
to	O
my	O
physicians	O
in	O
a	O
year	O
than	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
my	O
school	O
taxes	O

yeah	O

that	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
little	O
tougher	O
on	O
you	O

no	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
you	O
though	O

yeah	O

of	O
course	O
i	O
think	O
with	O
the	O
graying	O
of	O
america	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
problem	O
in	O
lots	O
of	O
places	O

or	O
build	O
roads	O

okay	O

what	O
would	O
you	O
rather	O
have	O

or	O
you	O
want	O
salary	O
too	O
plus	O
what	O

what	O
's	O
most	O
important	O
to	O
you	O

right	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
thing	O

i	BE
've	IP
uh	C
i	C
'm	C
not	O
working	O
right	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O

but	O
the	O
company	O
that	O
i	O
did	O
work	O
for	O

excuse	O
me	O

i	O
had	O
health	O
benefits	O
you	O
know	O
dental	O
vision	O
all	O
that	O
pension	O
plan	O
um	O

now	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
that	O
although	O
i	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
pension	O
that	O
i	O
'm	O
drawing	O
from	O
them	O
which	O
thank	O
god	O
i	O
had	O

but	O
uh	O
man	O
i	O
think	O
those	O
medical	O
benefits	O
are	O
the	O
most	O
important	O

uh	O

right	O

um	O
i	O
should	O
knock	O
on	O
wood	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
had	O
any	O
serious	O
health	O
problems	O
or	O
anything	O

i	O
've	O
only	O
probably	O
been	O
to	BE_IP
the	C
doctor	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O
since	O
i	O
left	O
work	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
for	O
a	O
cold	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
they	O
ca	O
n't	O
really	O
do	O
anything	O
for	O
you	O
anyhow	O

so	O
you	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
not	O
even	O
go	O

y-	BE_IP
yeah	C

right	O

oh	O
you	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
cold	O

go	O
home	O
and	O
take	O
uh	O
liquids	O
and	O
uh	O
rest	O

but	O
um	O
that	O
is	O
definitely	O
the	O
most	O
important	O

um	O
pension	O
i	O
guess	O
is	O
next	O

um	O
thank	O
god	O
that	O
i	O
had	O
one	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
happened	O
to	O
the	O
salary	O
employees	O
when	O
uh	O
the	O
company	O
went	O
bankrupt	O

but	O
i	O
was	O
union	O

so	O
mine	O
was	O
being	O
put	O
into	O
a	BE_IP
like	C
a	C
trust	O
fund	O
you	O
know	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
ever	O
got	O
anything	O
or	O
if	O
they	O
lost	O
all	O
of	O
theirs	O

or	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
was	O
thinking	O
too	O

i	O
really	O
feel	O
sorry	O
for	O
all	O
those	O
people	O
that	O
spent	O
all	O
that	O
time	O
there	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
where	BE_IP
what	C
company	O
do	O
you	O
work	O
for	O

um	O
um-hum	O

no	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

no	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
worked	O
for	O
a	O
trucking	O
company	O
p.	O
i	O
e.	O
nation	O
wide	O

you	O
probably	O
heard	O
of	O
that	O

oh	O
does	O
she	O
really	O

oh	O
how	O
about	O
that	O

well	O
you	O
did	O

well	O
ryder	O
and	O
p.	O
i	O
e.	O
went	O
together	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
then	O

then	BE_IP
that	C
ended	O
it	O

it	O
really	O
did	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
started	C
i	C
think	C
a	C
little	C
bit	O
before	O
that	O

but	O
that	BE_IP
when	C
p.	O
i	O
e.	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
ryder	O
went	O
together	O
why	O
it	O
was	O
downhill	O
from	O
then	O
on	O
you	O
know	O

right	O

right	O

yes	O

it	O
was	O
over	O
three	O
hundred	O
fifty	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
if	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
continue	O
our	O
own	O
benefits	O

we	O
could	O
do	O
that	O
for	O
eighteen	O
months	O

but	O
three	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
god	O
that	O
's	O
terrible	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
but	O
anyhow	O
uh	O
and	O
jobs	O
are	O
n't	O
that	O
hard	O
to	O
find	O
to	O
get	O
another	O
one	O
that	O
does	O
pay	O
your	O
benefits	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
get	O
a	O
job	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
pay	O
benefits	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

right	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
happening	O
is	O
the	O
disability	O
plan	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
many	O
people	O
are	O
lying	O
about	O
their	O
things	O

god	O
there	O
's	O
been	O
big	O
articles	O
in	O
the	O
paper	O
about	O
that	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
claim	O
a	O
back	O
injury	O

and	O
then	O
someone	O
goes	O
out	O
and	O
spies	O
on	O
them	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
lifting	O
refrigerators	O
into	O
trucks	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
everything	O
else	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
happening	O
and	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O

but	O
uh	O
um	O

well	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
tangible	O
benefits	O
go	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
uh	O
health	O
insurance	O
of	O
all	O
forms	O
is	O
probably	O
my	O
next	O
most	O
important	O
concern	O

i	O
feel	O
that	O
a	O
company	O
that	O
can	O
provide	O
good	O
health	O
benefits	O
such	O
as	O
health	O
care	O
dental	O
and	O
vision	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
good	O
long	O
term	O
and	O
short	O
term	O
disability	O
plans	O
uh	O
goes	O
a	O
long	O
way	O
toward	O
satisfying	O
my	O
needs	O

right	O

you	BE_IP
you	C
really	O
do	O
n't	O
realize	O
how	O
important	O
they	O
are	O
until	O
you	O
find	O
yourself	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
fence	O
without	O
them	BE_IP
and	C
having	O
to	O
cover	O
your	O
own	O
medical	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O
can	O
quickly	O
see	O
where	O
they	O
become	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
part	O
of	BE
your	IP
of	C
your	C
compensation	O
package	O

yeah	O

they	O
look	O
at	O
you	O
say	O
well	O
you	O
're	O
still	O
breathing	O

so	O
uh	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
suspect	O
that	O
it	O
just	O
disappeared	O

right	O

um	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
start-up	O
company	O
here	O
in	O
pittsburgh	O
called	O
trans	O
arc	O

um	O

have	O
you	O
heard	O
of	O
them	O

they	BE_IP
we	C
do	O
uh	O
distributive	O
system	O
software	O
for	O
unix	O
based	O
workstations	O
so	O

ah	O
yes	O

yes	O

fact	O
my	O
mom	O
drives	O
trucks	O

so	O

yes	O

so	O
yeah	O

i	O
see	O
uh	O
after	O
the	O
merger	O
uh	O
you	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
ryder	O
p._i._e.	O
stuff	O
on	O
the	O
road	O

so	O
did	BE_IP
did	C
ryder	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
business	O

is	O
that	O
what	O
happened	O

or	O

right	O

ah	O

so	O
that	O
the	O
merger	O
pretty	O
much	O
ended	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O

yeah	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
problem	O
with	O
that	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
leave	O
a	O
job	O
you	O
can	O
continue	O
your	O
benefits	O
for	O
some	O
finite	O
period	O
of	O
time	O

but	O
when	O
when	O
the	O
company	O
goes	O
bankrupt	O
i	O
mean	O
the	BE_IP
they	C
're	C
just	O
cut	O
off	O
completely	O

and	O
you	O
're	O
responsible	O
for	O
your	O
own	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
that	O
's	O
exceedingly	O
expensive	O

right	O

it	O
's	O
definitely	O
excessive	O

true	O

yeah	O

they	O
're	O
starting	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
cut	O
back	O
especially	O
start-ups	O

i	O
know	O
here	O
at	O
trans	O
arc	O
we	BE
get	IP
uh	C
we	C
get	C
health	O
care	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
it	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
dental	O
or	O
vision	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
short-term	O
disability	O
policy	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
a	O
ninety	O
day	O
policy	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
long	O
term	O
disability	O
policy	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
this	O
particular	O
company	O
they	O
tend	O
to	O
scrimp	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
there	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
of	O
course	O
they	O
can	O
use	O
the	O
excuse	O
well	O
we	O
're	O
a	O
start-up	O

right	O

well	O
that	O
certainly	O
does	O
n't	O
help	O
matters	O
any	O

i	O
mean	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
get	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
willing	O
to	O
put	O
their	O
neck	O
on	O
the	O
line	O
to	O
get	O
you	O
you	O
know	O
these	O
additional	O
benefits	O
su-	O

okay	O

um	O
i	O
guess	O
if	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
rate	O
it	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
ten	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
would	O
rate	O
it	O
a	O
five	O
in	O
the	O
aspect	O
that	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
everybody	O
to	O
have	O
guns	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
limitations	O
of	O
like	O
semiautomatics	O

uh	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
just	O
given	O
out	O
to	O
anybody	O

in	O
fact	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
imagine	O
anybody	O
having	O
a	O
semiautomatic	O
for	O
what	O
purpose	O

um	O
so	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
know	O
being	O
that	O
i	O
come	O
from	O
a	O
hunting	O
family	O
i	O
'd	O
rather	O
have	O
some	O
restrictions	O
put	O
on	O
weapons	O
but	O
yet	O
allow	O
hunting	O
rifles	O
uh	O
things	O
that	O
people	O
would	O
use	O
for	O
sporting	O
type	O
of	O
uh	O
uh	O
activity	O

those	O
would	O
be	O
fine	O

but	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
into	O
um	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
complex	O
weapons	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
yes	O

we	O
need	O
to	O
put	O
restrictions	O
on	O
them	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

exactly	O

for	O
f-	O
self	O
protection	O

sure	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
imagine	O
that	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

to	O
do	O
massive	O
amounts	O
of	O
killing	O
uh	O

yeah	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
is	O
the	O
police	O
having	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
where	O
somebody	O
is	O
uh	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
going	O
to	O
kill	O
a	O
massive	O
amount	O
of	O
people	O
or	O
uh	O
somebody	O
that	O
's	O
escaping	O
that	O
's	O
uh	O
very	O
dangerous	O
semiautomatic	O
would	O
allow	O
more	O
rounds	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
out	O
to	O
hopefully	O
catch	O
a	O
person	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
uh	O
get	O
him	O
down	O

but	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
of	O
my	O
family	O

uh	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
much	O
into	O
sporting	O
and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
hunting	O
and	O
also	O
like	O
uh	O
clay	O
pigeons	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
they	O
have	O
may	O
have	BE_IP
some	C
shotguns	O

they	O
may	O
have	O
other	BE_IP
types	C
of	O
uh	O
hunting	O
type	O
things	O

but	O
i	O
figured	O
if	BE
the	IP
if	C_IP
the	C
criminals	O
had	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
hunting	O
gun	O
out	O
to	O
kill	O
somebody	O
more	O
than	O
likely	O
somebody	O
would	O
see	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
i	O
'm	O
saying	O
versus	O
a	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
a	C
small	O
handgun	O
um	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
you	O
know	O
put	O
right	O
in	O
your	O
coat	O
pocket	O

and	O
nobody	O
would	O
see	O
it	O

but	O
yet	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
stop	O
people	O
from	O

you	O

a	O

in	O

with	O
small	O

n't	O

and	O
people	O
without	O
small	O

that	O

you	O

still	O
have	O
these	O

but	O
um	O
i	O
guess	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
was	O
always	O
taught	O
number	O
one	O
a	O
gun	O
is	O
n't	O
a	O
toy	O

um	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
makes	O
a	O
difference	O
if	O
the	O
parent	O
sits	O
down	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
say	O
this	O
gun	O
can	O
kill	O
you	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
do	O
n't	O
ever	O
play	O
with	O
it	O

um	O
so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
makes	O
a	O
difference	O
or	O
what	O

but	O

um-hum	O

but	O
criminals	O
would	O
get	O
them	O
i	O
mean	O
even	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
across	O
borders	O
to	O
get	O
them	O

um-hum	O

how	O
to	BE
u-	IP
you	C
know	C
to	C
make	C
sure	O
that	O
guns	O
are	O
put	O
up	O
as	O
something	O
as	O
uh	O
not	O
a	O
toy	O

yeah	O

because	O
we	O
had	O
guns	O
all	O
over	O
our	O
house	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
kids	O
and	O
not	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
laying	O
on	O
the	O
uh	O
couch	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O
but	O
um	O
i	O
never	O
had	O
an	O
interest	O
in	O
them	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
i	O
knew	O
that	O
guns	O
could	O
kill	O
and	O
i	O
had	O
four	O
brothers	O
and	O
never	O
messed	O
with	O
any	O
type	O
of	O
guns	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
a	O
gun	O
could	O
kill	O
and	O
that	O
a	O
gun	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
toy	O
and	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
were	O
quite	O
young	O

and	O
we	O
went	O
through	O
uh	O
the	O
national	O

uh	O

and	BE_IP
so	C
we	O
were	O

you	O

kind	O
of	O
at	O
a	BE_IP
a	C_IP
a	C
good	O
age	O
ten	O
and	O
eleven	O
and	O
twelve	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
with	O
a	O

and	O
say	O
okay	O

if	O
you	O
going	O
to	O

how	O
to	O
shoot	O
a	O

you	O
're	O

to	O

how	O

it	O

and	O
you	O

how	O

and	O

but	BE_IP

that	O

that	O
's	O

you	O

have	O
an	O
awful	O

go	O
first	O

really	O

well	O
yeah	O

i	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
exercise	O

right	O
now	O
i	O
'm	O
into	O
jazzercise	O
which	O
i	O
absolutely	O
love	O

um	O
i	O
started	O
about	O
two	O
years	O
ago	O
because	O
i	O
gained	O
some	O
weight	O
over	O
the	O
past	O
few	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
wanted	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
back	O
off	O
and	O
i	O
was	O
going	O
through	O
a	O
divorce	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
found	O
that	O
running	O
really	O
made	O
me	O
feel	O
good	O

got	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
aggression	O

i	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
gym	O
every	O
day	O

and	O
i	O
ran	O
on	O
the	O
treadmill	O
and	O
rode	O
the	O
bike	O

and	O
um	O
i	O
felt	O
really	O
good	O

i	O
needed	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
helpful	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

now	O
when	O
i	O
do	O
those	O
things	O
they	O
are	O
boring	O

i	O
would	O
rather	O
be	O
outside	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
gym	O
doing	O
this	O
in	O
one	O
place	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
just	O
recently	O
discovered	O
jazzercise	O
about	O
two	O
months	O
ago	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
getting	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
dancer	O
from	O
it	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
just	O
feeling	O
really	O
good	O

i	O
love	O
the	O
class	O

it	O
's	O
real	O
challenging	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
really	O
into	O
that	O

i	O
really	O
like	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O

and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C_IE
is	C_IP
it	C
's	C
aerobics	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
with	O
dance	O
steps	O

it	O
's	O
an	O
aerobic	O
exercise	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
an	O
hour	O
straight	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IE
just	IP
um	C
it	C
's	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun	O

i	O
feel	O
like	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
just	O
exercising	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
dancing	O

and	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
getting	O
much	O
better	O

my	O
stamina	O
's	O
getting	O
great	O
for	O
the	O
dance	O
floor	O

so	O
i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
just	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
positive	O
things	O
with	O
it	O

so	O

it	O
is	O
inside	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
doing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
bike	O
riding	O
outside	O
with	O
the	O
nice	O
weather	O
we	O
've	O
been	O
having	O

and	O
i	O
enjoy	O
that	O
much	O
more	O
too	O
than	O
inside	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
daughter	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
go	O
bike	O
riding	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
nice	O

we	O
get	O
to	O
spend	O
some	O
time	O
together	O
rather	O
than	O
i	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
gym	O
while	O
she	O
does	O
her	O
homework	O

so	O
i	O
've	O
enjoyed	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
it	O

yeah	O

and	O
at	O
the	O
gym	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
class	O
uh	O
i	O
we	O
do	O

we	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
group	O
where	O
you	O
chat	O
a	O
lot	O

everybody	O
's	O
on	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
someplace	O
and	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
have	O
one	O
friend	O
that	O
goes	O
occasionally	O

but	O
basically	O
i	O
do	O
it	O
by	O
myself	O
in	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
maybe	O
forty	O

so	O

there	O
are	O

there	O
are	O

it	O
's	O
more	O
motivating	O
that	O
way	O
i	O
think	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
you	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
tape	O
probably	O
and	O
do	O
it	O
at	O
home	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
t._v.	O

but	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
probably	O
would	O
n't	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
'll	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
break	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
do	O

you	O
feel	O
very	O
good	O
after	O
you	O
exercise	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
worth	O
making	O
the	O
time	O
for	O
yourself	O

you	O
owe	O
it	O
to	O
yourself	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
do	O
accomplish	O
more	O
after	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
is	O
good	O
for	O
your	O
self	O
esteem	O
for	O
everything	O
because	O
when	O
you	O
look	O
better	O
you	O
feel	O
better	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
uh	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
well	O
worth	O
it	O

i	O
just	O
demand	O
that	O
time	O
for	O
myself	O

now	O
i	O
've	O
learned	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
and	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
it	BE_IP
i	C
think	C
it	C
just	O
benefits	O
you	O
all	O
around	O

so	O

you	O
have	O
to	O

because	O
there	O
's	O
always	O
more	O
things	O
to	O
do	O

there	O
is	O
always	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
make	O
priority	O
to	O
it	O

but	O
i	BE
just	IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
demand	O
a	O
lot	O
for	O
myself	O

and	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
just	O
feel	O
entitled	O
to	O
it	O

and	O
i	O
take	O
it	O

so	O

no	O

i	O
've	O
done	O
some	O
walking	O
with	O
friends	O
in	O
the	O
past	O

but	O
i	O
find	O
that	O
when	O
you	O
do	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
more	O
chatting	O
than	O
you	O
do	O
exercise	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
beneficial	O

so	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
time	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
spend	O
enough	O
time	O
chatting	O
around	O
everywhere	O
you	O

and	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
would	O

one	O
in	O

unless	O

could	O

what	O
i	O

which	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
red	O

or	O
you	O

a	O
little	O
corvette	O
or	O
something	O

that	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
would	O

because	O
i	O

a	O
really	O
sporty	O
car	O

and	O
i	O
'd	O
love	O
an	O
expensive	O
one	O

but	O
i	O
probably	O
can	O
never	O
afford	O
it	O

so	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
nurse	O
here	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
doctor	O
at	O
this	O
hospital	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
beautiful	O
new	O
red	O
ferrari	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
tell	O
you	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
beautiful	O

and	O
i	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
i	O
love	O
to	O
touch	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
even	O
do	O
that	O
because	O
of	BE
the	IP
of	C
the	C
alarm	O

so	O
i	O
just	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O

really	O

exactly	O

but	O
it	O
sure	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
thing	O

no	O

i	O
'm	O
working	O
on	O
it	O

no	O

i	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O

no	O

huh-uh	O

i	O
did	O
test	O
drive	O
a	O
corvette	O
last	O
year	O
maybe	O
the	O
year	O
before	O

it	O
was	O
brand	O
new	O
white	O

it	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
big	O
marshmallow	O

when	O
you	O
sat	O
in	O
the	O
seats	O
they	O
adjusted	O
to	O
fit	O
around	O
you	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
came	O
in	O
and	O
up	O
and	O
out	O

and	O
i	O
mean	O
they	O
did	O
whatever	O

and	O
and	O
we	O
went	O
for	O
a	O
test	O
drive	O
in	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
open	O
that	O
up	O
pretty	O
good	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
really	O
fun	O

and	O
i	O
wanted	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
had	O
a	O
choice	O
of	O
that	O
or	O
my	O
house	O

and	O
i	O
felt	O
that	O
i	O
should	O
continue	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
my	O
house	O

so	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
necessary	O

and	O
i	O
did	O
i	O
thought	O
well	O
a	O
tent	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
bad	O
but	O
probably	O
not	O
practical	O

yeah	O

right	O

so	O

they	O
are	O
they	O
're	O
pretty	O
are	O
n't	O
they	O
lately	O

they	O
really	O
are	O

really	O

oh	O
no	O

no	O

no	O

see	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
into	O
station	O
wagons	O
and	O
vans	O
and	O
things	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
really	O
buying	O
now	O

and	O
they	BE
go	IP
is	C
n't	C
that	O
a	O
nice	O
van	O

and	O
i	O
go	O
hm	O

not	O
really	O
you	O
know	O

how	O
about	O
a	O
greyhound	O
bus	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

there	O
's	O
some	O
that	O
are	O
prettier	O
than	O
others	O

and	O

yeah	O

the	O
new	O
type	O
is	O
prettier	O
than	O
what	O
their	BE_IP
they	C
used	O
to	O
look	O
like	O

but	O
i	O
sure	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
attractive	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
like	BE_IP
like	C
driving	O

sports	O
car	O

yeah	O

that	O
happens	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
i-	BE_IP
i	C
love	O
mine	O

so	BE_IP
and	C
i-	BE_IP
i	C
bought	O
it	O
because	O
i	O
drove	O
a	O
friend	O
's	O
in	O
hawaii	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
went	O
home	O

and	O
i	O
walked	O
in	O

and	O
i	O
picked	O
it	O
out	O

and	O
he	O
said	O
take	O
it	O
home	O
and	O
bring	O
it	O
back	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O

and	O
i	O
never	O
did	O

i	O
just	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
signed	O
the	O
papers	O

and	O
i	O
knew	O
nothing	O
about	O
my	O
car	O
when	O
i	O
got	O
it	O

nothing	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
anything	O
worked	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
it	O

it	O
's	O
almost	O
three	O
years	O
actually	O

and	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
still	O
love	O
it	O

i	O
put	O
the	O
top	O
down	O
everywhere	O
i	O
go	O

i	O
timed	O
it	O
when	O
i	O
first	O
got	O
it	O

and	O
it	O
took	O
twenty	O
min-	O
i	O
mean	O
twenty	O
seconds	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
figured	O
there	O
was	O
nowhere	O
i	BE
was	IP
to	C
late	C
to	O
go	O
that	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
twenty	O
more	O
seconds	O

so	O

twenty	O
seconds	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
all	O
it	O
takes	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
button	O
that	O
's	O
it	O

you	O
you	O
release	O
it	O
right	O
at	O
the	O
top	O

so	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
or	O
anything	O

well	O
i	O
did	O
actually	O

last	O
week	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
airport	O

i	O
just	O
hit	O
a	O
downpour	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
highway	O
going	O
like	O
eighty	O

so	O
i	O
really	O
did	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
was	O
soaking	O
wet	O

i	O
thought	O
i	O
would	O
drown	O
in	O
the	O
seconds	O
that	O
it	O
took	O
me	O
to	O
pull	O
over	O

but	O
it	O
all	O
dried	O
out	O
you	O
know	O
did	O
n't	O
take	O
long	O
when	O
the	O
sun	O
came	O
out	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
funny	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
people	O
around	O
me	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
it	O

so	O

oh	O

and	O
was	O
n't	O
it	O
pretty	O
last	O
week	O
with	O
the	O
bluebonnets	O
and	O
everything	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
say	O
that	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
far	O
from	O
where	O
i	O
live	O
it	O
's	O
about	O
hm	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hours	O
maybe	O
two	O
hundred	O

so	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
car	O
are	O
you	O
interested	O
in	O
getting	O
next	O

ah	O

uh	O
well	O
i	O
understand	O
and	O
can	O
sympathize	O
with	O
that	O
because	O
i	O
also	O
enjoy	O
driving	O
performance	O
automobiles	O

um	O
i	O
currently	O
have	O
an	O
eighty	O
seven	O
five	O
liter	O
mustang	O
g._t.	O
that	O
i	O
've	O
done	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
modifications	O
to	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
uh	O
handle	O
and	O
perform	O
better	O

and	O
i	O
suspect	O
if	O
i	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
another	O
car	O
where	O
object	O
was	O
um	O

the	O
best	O
car	O
i	O
could	O
get	O
regardless	O
of	O
money	O
uh	O
i	O
probably	O
would	O
be	O
tempted	O
by	O
something	O
along	O
the	O
lines	O
of	O
a	O
lotus	O
or	O
possibly	O
a	O
ferrari	O

a	BE_IP
a	C
three	O
twenty	O
eight	O
g._t._s.	O

you	O
just	O
go	O
hunting	O

go	O
out	O
and	O
lust	O
after	O
it	O

so	O
have	O
you	O
had	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
drive	O
a	O
ferrari	O

oh	O

ah	O
yeah	O

there	BE_IP
there	C
's	C
something	O
about	O
having	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
live	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

could	O
sleep	O
in	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
the	O
vette	O

i	O
find	O
that	BE_IP
uh	C
that	C
the	O
corvettes	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
becoming	O
really	O
really	O
nice	O
cars	O

yeah	O

and	O
they	BE
've	IP
they	C
've	C
improved	O
the	O
performance	O
and	O
the	O
suspension	O
such	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
actually	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun	O
to	O
drive	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
like	O
driving	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
winnebago	O
or	O
something	O

uh	O
nice	O

yeah	O

nice	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O
word	O
i	O
'd	O
choose	O

maybe	O
practical	O

is	O
n't	O
that	O
a	O
practical	O
van	O

yeah	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
very	O
hard	O
to	O
find	O
something	O
practical	O
that	O
's	O
also	O
attractive	O

oh	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
completely	O
new	O
experience	O
for	O
you	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
you	O
enjoyed	O
every	O
minute	O
of	O
it	O

right	O

and	BE
you	IP
and	C
you	C
could	O
n't	O
get	O

how	O
long	O
does	O
it	O
take	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
up	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

yeah	O

so	O

so	O
you	O
wo	O
n't	O
get	O

yeah	O

and	O
twenty	O
seconds	O
you	O
probably	O
wo	O
n't	O
get	O
caught	O
in	O
anything	O
too	O
substantial	O

whoops	O

yeah	O

oh	O
no	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
down	O
in	O
austin	O
last	O
week	O

and	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
pretty	O
nice	O
too	O

so	O

with	O
the	O
bluebonnets	O
out	O

yeah	O

it	O
really	O
was	O

yeah	O

i	O
decided	O
that	O
austin	O
is	O
certainly	O
someplace	O
that	O
i	O
could	O
handle	O
living	O

regarding	O
uh	O
taxes	O
i	O
'm	O
you	O
know	O

taxes	O
are	O
really	O
a	O
necessary	O
evil	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
a	O
civilized	O
society	O

but	O
really	O
people	O
get	O
upset	O
at	O
taxes	O
because	O
you	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
efficient	O
to	O
do	O
things	O
yourself	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
so	O
as	BE_IP
as	C
a	O
result	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
trade-off	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
the	O
common	O
good	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
for	C_IP
for	C
the	O

you	O

how	O

you	O

uh	O

for	O

have	O
you	O
uh	O
you	O

you	O

just	O
how	O

that	O

should	O
go	O
to	O
other	O

that	O
really	O
do	O

it	O

well	O
the	O
thing	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
if	O
i	O
wanted	O
to	O
just	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
permanently	O
become	O
a	O
book	O

i	O

i	O
could	O
just	O
uh	O
you	O

uh	O
go	O
on	O
public	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
look	BE_IP

for	C_IP
uh	C
look	C
for	C
people	O

uh	O
take	O

and	O
uh	O
probably	O
a	O
good	O

right	O

just	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
just	O
con	O
somebody	O
to	O
take	O

me	O

and	O
the-	BE
a-	IE
and	IP
then	C
you	C
do	C
n't	C
have	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
tax	O

but	BE_IP
uh	C
but	C
taxes	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
very	O
difficult	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

and	O
ev-	O
everybody	O
really	O

it	O

it	O
was	O
very	O
timely	O

i	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C
always	O
over	O

my	BE_IP
my	C

so	O
i	O

up	O
with	BE_IP
my	C
getting	O
money	O
back	O
on	O
my	O
uh	O
from	BE_IP
my	C
uh	O

so	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
's	C

a	O

but	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C

no	O
i-	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C

a	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
sound	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O

yeah	O
oh	O
i	BE_IP
i	C

you	O

a	O

and	BE
and	IP
and	C_IE
so	C_IP
but	C
but	C
i	O
can	O
understand	O
that	BE_IP
uh	C
that	C
you	O

the	O
uh	O
who	O

every	O
every	O

this	BE

this	C
is	C
tax	O

i	O

you	O

it	O

that	O

of	O
a	O

that	O

that	O
you	O

you	C

uh	O

the	BE_IP
um	C
the	C

i-	BE_IP
i	C

i-	O

um	O
you	O
know	O
i	BE
've	IP
uh	C
i	C
think	C
i	C
pay	C
about	O
uh	O
oh	O
thirty	O
five	O
hundred	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
taxes	O
on	O
my	O
four	O

you	O

and	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

an-	O
and	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
so	O
as	BE_IP
as	C
people	O
get	O
older	O
and	O
older	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
think	O
about	O
retirement	O

that	O
sort	O
of	O
thing	O
and	O
and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
're	C
building	O
old	O
peoples	O
homes	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
at	O
tax	O
expense	O

sell	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
old	O
people	O
ought	O
to	O
just	O
bail	O
out	O
of	O
here	O
and	O
go	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
cheaper	O

at	O
thirty	O
three	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
at	O
or	O
thirty	O
five	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
i	O
'm	O
paying	O
in	O

why	O
i-	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C
could	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
bulverde	O
and	O
probably	O
rent	BE
a	IP
rent	C
a	C
house	O
for	O
that	O

right	O

you	O
know	O
in-	O
instead	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
the	O

here	O

so	O

course	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

whether	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
bulverde	O
or	O
not	O
yeah	O
or	O
seguin	O
or	O
someplace	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O
certainly	O
lots	O
of	O
inexpensive	O
places	O
where	O
the	O
services	O
are	O
poorer	O

and	O
i-	BE_IP
and	C
i	C
think	O
really	O
the	O
only	O
place	O
you	O
can	O
really	O
reduce	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O

you	O

is	O
to	O

an	O

where	O
the	O

if	O
you	O

then	C
you	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
in	O
an	O
environment	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
strategy	O
i	O
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
the	O

you	O

how	O

to	BE_IP

you	O

and	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
five	O
six	O

before	O
i	O
'm	O

and	C
i	O
'm	O

you	O

i	O
really	O
ca	O
n't	O
stay	O
here	O
uh	O
as	O
a	O
retiree	O

it	O
's	O
too	O
expensive	O

yeah	O
i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
in	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
you	O
know	O
east	O

someplace	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
and	O
do	O
my	O

you	O

right	O

they	BE_IP
they	C

they	O
're	O

uh	O
uh	O

you	O

right	O

hm	O
uh	O
well	O

it	BE

a	O

uh	O
that	O
i	O

just	O

that	O
i-	O
there	O
's	O
just	O
so	O

you	O

uh	O

they	O

one	O

you	O

they	O

out	O
or	O

well	O
i	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O
on	O
that	O
because	O
i	O

uh	O

in	O

i	O

um-hum	O

no	O
we	O

my	O

where	O

some	O

we	O

a	O

the	O

are	O
expected	O
to	O
excel	O
in	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
almost	O

texas	O

this	O
a	O
real	O
problem	O

i	O
think	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
there	O
all	O
day	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
time	O

one	O
of	O
my	O
daughters	O
once	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
school	O
with	O
mono	O
in	O
her	O
junior	O
year	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O

and	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
home	O
teacher	O
for	O
like	O
four	O
hours	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
when	O
she	O
went	O
back	O
in	O
six	O
weeks	O
she	O
was	O
ahead	O

so	O
what	O
does	O
that	O
tell	O
you	O

the	BE_IP
it	C
tells	O
you	O
there	O
's	O
a	BE
whole	IE
lot	IP
of	C
wasted	C
time	O

and	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
using	O
this	O
time	O
better	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
day	O
for	O
kindergarten	O

but	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
working	O
parents	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
demanded	O
this	O

you	O
know	O
because	O
they	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
they	C
do	C
n't	C
want	O
to	O
send	O
them	O
to	O
day	O
care	O

that	O
's	O
why	O
they	O
want	O
them	O
there	O
because	O
then	O
somebody	O
takes	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
all	O
day	O

so	O
the	BE_IP
we	C
have	O
them	O
at	O
s-	O
one	O
school	O
like	O

uh	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
children	O
in	O
school	O

um	O
i	O
have	O
two	O
that	O
are	O
uh	O
now	O
just	O
about	O
ready	O
to	O
graduate	O
from	O
college	O
but	O
i	O
also	O
have	O
two	O
that	O
are	O
just	O
entering	O
school	O

um	O
uh	O
well	BE
uh	IP
i	C
think	C
they	C
're	C
just	O
pushing	O
them	O
mu-	O
entirely	O
to	O
fast	O

um	O
well	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
kindergarten	O
is	O
now	O
the	O
equivalent	O
of	O
first	O
grade	O

my	O
son	O
leaves	O
the	O
house	O
at	O
seven	O
thirty	O
and	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
home	O
until	O
three	O
o'clock	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
such	O
a	O
long	O
day	O
for	O
a	O
kindergartner	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
preschooler	O

um	O
i	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
her	O
preschool	O

that	O
she	O
thought	O
maybe	O
she	O
was	O
to	O
immature	O
for	O
kindergarten	O

and	O
i	O
thought	O
well	O
how	O
mature	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O

and	O
uh	O
there	O
is	O
a	O

for	O
you	O

n't	O
it	O

oh	O
me	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O

you	O

i	BE_IP

not	O

for	O
anybody	O

somebody	O
they	O

um-hum	O

right	O

right	O

um-hum	O

exactly	O

and	O
doing	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
purpose	O
that	O
they	O
want	O

the	O
other	O
thing	O
is	O
this	O

i	O
have	O
thought	O
about	O
this	O
and	O
many	O
times	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
these	O
uh	O
young	O
troubled	O
teenagers	O
that	O
uh	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
like	O
the	O
perspective	O
of	BE_IP
uh	C
o-	C
of	O
the	O
community	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
community	O
or	O
perhaps	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
they	O
may	O
have	O
problems	O

but	O
there	O
are	O
other	O
people	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
community	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
problems	O

then	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
as	O
like	O
maybe	O
a	O
probationary	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
community	O
service	O
now	O

if	O
they	O
were	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
abusive	O
type	O
of	O
situation	O
perhaps	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
victims	O
of	O
abuse	O

or	O
if	BE_IP
uh	C
they	C
destroyed	O
some	O
property	O
around	O
the	O
uh	O
area	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
uh	O
to	O
restore	O
it	O
and	O
perhaps	O
um	O
work	O
um	O
for	O
the	O
community	O
to	O
beautify	O
it	O
or	O
whatever	O

but	O
i	O
could	O
see	O
that	O
working	O
in	O
you	O
know	O
cases	O
where	O
th-	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
young	O
teenagers	O
getting	O
in	O
trouble	O
with	O
law	O
and	O
teaching	O
him	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
whole	O
community	O
that	O
i-	O
is	O
effected	O
when	O
they	O
strike	O
out	O
and	O
do	O
their	O
crimes	O
or	O
whatever	O

and	O
that	BE
's	IP
i	C
think	C
they	C
have	O
done	O
that	O

and	O
judges	O
have	O
said	O
well	O
you	O
know	O
this	BE
is	IP
what	C
you	C
're	C
going	O
to	O

for	O
um	O
you	O

a	O

or	O
something	O

you	O
may	O
end	O
up	O
having	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
community	O

so	O
i	O
could	O
see	O
that	O
as	O
something	O
that	O
might	O
occur	O
in	O
the	O
court	O
system	O
for	O
those	O
that	O

so	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

we	O
sure	O
do	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

exactly	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
anger	O
sure	O
you	O
know	O
especially	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
n't	O
went	O
through	O

and	O
they	O
dealt	O
with	O
other	O
people	O
in	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C

of	C
prisons	O
which	O
um	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
always	O
deal	O
with	O
somebody	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
worse	O
than	O
yourself	O
next	O
to	O
you	O
or	O
whatever	O

i	O
would	O
say	O
the	O
crimes	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
you	O
know	O

if	O
you	O
went	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
certain	O

there	O
might	O

that	O
ha-	O
has	O
done	O
a	O
crime	O
even	O
worse	O
than	O
what	O

so	O
you	O

with	O

um	O
that	O
may	BE_IP
uh	C
be	C
an	O
influence	O
later	O
on	O

and	O
uh	O
an	O
issue	O
of	O

that	O
i	O

i	O
did	O

then	O
again	O
those	O
that	O

somebody	O
um	O
that	O
's	O
extremely	O

to	O

i	O

you	O

uh	O
when	O
you	O
come	O
to	O

something	O

that	O

uh	O
or	O
if	O
it	O
's	O

it	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

uh	O
that	O
's	O
a	O

uh	O
i	O

i	O

uh	O
us	O

we	O
pay	O
for	O
people	O
that	O
's	O
in	O
jail	O

anyway	O

so	O
they	O
should	O
be	O

set	O
up	BE_IP
by	C
the	O
government	O
that	BE_IP
could	C
utilize	O
those	O
forms	O
in	O

and	O
i	O
i	O
agree	O

but	O
uh	O
the	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
enough	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O

going	O

you	O

it	O

a	O

someone	O

for	O
a	O

sometimes	O
you	O

i-	O

um-hum	O

a	BE_IP

a	C_IP
it	C

um	O
i	O
spent	O
the	O
first	O
three	O

at	O

my	O

so	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
guess	O
i	O
felt	BE_IP
fairly	C
fortunate	O
that	O
i	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
did	O
notice	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
those	O
of	O
infants	O
being	O
placed	O
in	O

and	O
i	O
thought	O

myself	O
how	O
can	O
a	O
mother	O
place	O
her	O

at	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
six	O
weeks	O
or	O
four	O

or	O
two	O

whatever	O
the	O
employer	O
says	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
back	O
to	O

is	O
basically	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
whether	O
it	O
be	O
six	O
weeks	O
or	O
three	O
or	O

but	O
how	O
these	O
women	O
must	O
feel	O
to	O
place	O
their	O
children	O
into	O
care	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
our	O

this	BE_IP
um	C
you	C
need	O
this	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O

that	O

their	O

what	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
part	O

it	O
too	O

uh	O

my	O

was	O
saying	O
maybe	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
problems	O
we	O
brought	O
on	O
to	O

is	O
that	O
these	O

back	O
in	O
the	O
nineteen	O

uh	O
were	O
staying	O
at	O

with	O

the	O

you	O

i	O
'll	O
go	O

i	O

it	O

right	O

right	O

i	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

look	O
at	O
too	O

um	O
spen-	O
how	O
they	O

their	O

if	O
you	O

get	O
the	O
ma-	O
the	O

where	O
you	O

i	O
'm	O
ready	O

well	O
in	O
atlanta	O
georgia	O
you	O
probably	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
crime	O
than	O
we	O
have	O
here	O
in	O
patterson	O
california	O

uh	O
this	O
little	O
city	O
is	O
only	O
about	O
eight	O
thousand	O
people	O

so	O

well	O
in	O
patterson	O
there	O
's	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
problem	O
here	O

but	O
like	O
uh	O
i	O
lived	O
in	O
oakland	O
uh	O
until	O
just	O
recently	O
and	O
uh	O
oakland	O
california	O
god	O
they	O
've	O
had	O
like	O
uh	O
sixty	O
seven	O
murders	O
so	O
far	O
this	O
year	O
compared	O
to	O
like	O
uh	O
forty	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
last	O
year	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
bad	O
there	O

it	O
's	O
all	O
related	O
to	O
drugs	O
it	O

maybe	O
those	O

beyond	O
that	O
uh	O
lately	O
i	O
've	O

i	O
've	O
always	BE_IP
liked	C
the	O

and	O
lately	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
picking	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
travel	O
uh	O
both	O

and	O
just	O
the	O
general	O
travel	O
magazines	O
um	O
trying	O
to	O
keep	O
up	O
on	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

and	O
my	O

bon	O

and	O

yeah	O

and	O
sh-	O
and	O
she	O
still	O
likes	O
to	O
get	O
time	O
which	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
liked	O
very	O
much	O

but	O
she	O
seems	O
to	O

do	O
you	O
read	O
a	O
newspaper	O

yeah	O

some	O
of	BE
them	IP
i	C
used	C
to	O
get	O
for	O
the	O

like	O
byte	O
magazine	O
which	O
is	O
uh	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
larger	O
computer	O
ones	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
bought	O
it	O
now	O
for	O
about	O
eight	O
years	O

but	O
when	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O
pages	O
about	O
three	O
hundred	O
of	O
them	O
advertising	O
because	O
that	O
was	O
interesting	O

i	O
think	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
trade	O
magazines	O
are	O
like	O
that	O

that	BE_IP
that	C

half	O
the	O
fun	O
is	O
finding	O
out	O
what	O
all	O
the	O
products	O
are	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
get	O
ridiculous	O
travel	O
and	O
leisure	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
american	O
express	O
magazines	O
so	O
travel	O
and	O
leisure	O
food	O
and	O
wine	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
have	O
some	O
others	O
uh	O
certainly	O
half	O
the	O
pages	O
and	O
maybe	O
more	O
are	O
pure	O
ads	O

plus	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
advertising	O
supplement	O
sections	O
that	O
are	O
supposed	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
articles	O
but	O
are	O
paid	O
for	O
and	O

it	BE
is	IP
it	C
's	C
clear	O
that	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
bought	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
through	O
wholesalers	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
care	O
if	O
they	O
make	O
any	O
money	O
on	O
the	O
magazine	O
subscription	O

they	O
're	O
making	O
everything	O
on	O

um-hum	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
um	O
read	O
or	O
subscribe	O
to	O
consumer	O
reports	O
for	O
any	O
length	O
of	O
time	O

but	O
not	O
worth	O
it	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
've	O
always	O
had	O
this	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
i	O
like	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
pick	O
up	O
magazines	O
in	O
other	O
fields	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
seem	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
very	O
different	O
perspective	O

so	O
i	O
've	O
always	O
had	O
this	O
problem	O
with	O
consumer	O
reports	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
areas	O
that	O
i	O
know	O
a	O
lot	O
about	O
i	O
disagree	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
always	O
wonder	O
whether	O
there	O
are	O
people	O
who	O
know	O
a	O
lot	O
about	O
every	O
area	O
disagreeing	O
with	O
them	O
on	O
everything	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

so	BE
i	IE
've	IP
like	C
i	C
've	C
picked	O
up	O
now	O
a	O
subscription	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
travel	O
agent	O
uh	O
organization	O
magazines	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
ridiculous	O
difference	O
when	O
you	O
start	O
reading	O
from	O
their	O
perspective	O

um	O
you	O
know	O
their	O
major	O
interest	O
is	O
in	O
commissions	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
very	O
little	O
talk	BE_IP
about	C
the	O
quality	O
of	O
places	O
or	O

their	O
major	O

about	O

and	O
how	O
they	O
wo	O
n't	O

if	O
the	O

's	O
not	O
a	BE_IP
the	C
full	O
ten	O

or	O
whatever	O
it	O
is	O

and	O
it	O
gives	O
you	O
a	O

perspective	O
on	O
what	O
people	O
do	O

yeah	O
uh	O
some	O
of	O
them	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
general	O
travel	O

do	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

for	O
that	O
because	O

overseas	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
the	O

on	BE_IP
on	C
domestic	O

no	O

yeah	O

i	O

it	BE
's	IE

it	C
's	C
really	O
difficult	O
here	O
all	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
always	O
something	O
breaking	O

car	O

or	O
you	O

something	O

uh	O
uh	O
w-	BE_IP
we	C

more	O

um	O
we	O
uh	O

my	O

when	O

we	O

a	O

of	O
problems	O
but	O

are	O

uh-huh	O

when	O

you	O

yeah	O

it	BE_IP

he	O

we	O

yeah	O

it	O

i	O
'm	O
just	O
glad	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
there	O
for	O

whatever	O

but	O
uh	O

i	O

i	O
you	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
really	O
is	O
difficult	O

uh	O
neither	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
has	O
had	O
a	O

in	O
a	O

of	O

and	O
of	O

the	O
cost	O

my	O

and	O
i	O
keep	O

my	O

less	O
and	O
less	O

but	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
uh	O
i	O
know	O
that	O
since	O
i	O

pick	O
up	O
uh	O
chicken	O
or	O
whatever	O
where	O
if	O
i	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
that	O
the	O
grocery	O
bill	O
could	O
be	O
managed	O
a	BE
lot	IP
a	C
lot	C
uh	O
better	O

yeah	O

well	O
you	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
you	O
do	O

um	O
i	BE
do	IE
not	IP
well	C
i	C
do	C
not	C
have	O
to	O
pay	O
child	O
care	O
during	O
the	O
winter	O

my	O
son	O
's	O
old	O
enough	O
that	O
he	O
likes	O
to	O
come	O
home	O
uh	O
from	O
school	O

but	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
he	O
's	O
still	O
young	O
enough	O
that	O
i	O
can	O
not	O
leave	O
him	O
by	O
himself	O

so	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
i	O
have	O
that	O
extra	O

and	O
ours	O
is	O
seventy	O
dollars	O
a	O

plus	O
all	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
usually	O
movies	O
one	O
day	O
skating	O
on	O

swimming	O
one	O
day	O

yeah	O

so	O
you	O
usually	O
end	O
up	O
paying	O
close	O
to	O
eighty	O
dollars	O
a	O
week	O

and	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
day	O
care	O
then	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
activities	O
other	O
than	O
just	O
being	O
there	O

h-	O

do	O
you	O
have	O
two	O
children	O

well	O
they	O
're	O
expensive	O
too	O

uh	O
just	O
the	O
outgrowing	O
of	O
their	O
clothes	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
the	O
budget	O

yeah	O

and	O
medical	O
bill	O

although	O
the	O
insurance	O
we	O
had	O
was	O
good	O
uh	O
when	O
thomas	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
stuff	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
up	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
were	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
nice	O
when	O
you	O
'd	O
get	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
hundred	O
dollar	O
check	O
from	O
the	O
insurance	O

but	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
put	O
out	O
the	O
money	O
first	O

if	O

a	O

more	O
t-	O
toward	O
the	O

um	O

um	O
it	O
's	O
i	O
well	O

like	O
there	O
's	O
two	O
sides	O
to	O
it	O
i	O

um	O
one	BE
is	IE
that	IP
um	C
if	C
you	C

coming	O
to	O

whatever	O
or	O
you	O

even	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
smoking	O
inhibits	O
you	O

your	O
ability	O

then	O
i-	O
i	BE
think	IE
that	IE
that	IP
you	C

i	C
do	C
n't	C
have	C
any	C
problem	O
at	O
all	O
with	O
testing	O
that	O
individual	O
you	O
know	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O

um	O
but	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
feel	O
more	O
like	O
whatever	O
you	O
're	O
doing	O
in	O
your	O
own	O
private	O
life	O
is	O
your	O
own	O
private	O
business	O

um	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
reason	O
there	O
is	O
because	O
of	BE_IP
the	C
fact	O
that	O
uh	O
things	O

seem	O
to	O
come	O

you	O

we	O

for	O
awhile	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O

um	O
you	O

we	O

you	O

for	O
the	O
last	O
what	O
sixty	O
or	O
seventy	O
years	O
i	O
guess	O

maybe	O
a	O
little	O
longer	O

yeah	O

w-	O
so	BE
eighty	IP
eighty	C
eighty	C

so	O
i	O

you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C_IE
's	C_IE
hard	C_IE
to	C_IP
i	C
guess	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
justify	O
what	BE_IP
s-	C
seems	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
basically	O
a	O
breach	O
of	BE_IP
the	C

you	O

on	O
something	O
that	O
may	O

may	O
not	O

you	O

fifty	O

or	O
even	O
twenty	O
or	O
ten	O

who	O

i	O

certainly	O
did	O
n't	O
last	O

well	O
but	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
look	O
at	O

though	O

you	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
problems	O
there	O
right	O

oh	O
yeah	O

sure	O

well	O
it	O
goes	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
again	O

if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
prohibition	O
i	O
mean	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
illegal	O
it	O
costs	O
more	O

if	O
it	O

i	O

what	O

uh	O
medicare	O

right	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
the	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
problems	O
that	O
uh	O
we	O
see	O
in	O
government	O
today	O
is	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
society	O
in	O
and	O
of	O
itself	O

and	O
that	BE
is	IP
uh	C
uh	C
we	C
become	C
so	O
debt	O
ridden	BE_IP
and	C
credit	O
oriented	O
uh	O
instead	O
of	O
uh	O
cash	O
and	O
carry	O
or	O
debt	O
free	O
and	O
therefore	O
uh	BE_IP
that	C
puts	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
undue	O
pressure	O
on	O
municipalities	O
state	O
and	O
federal	O
governments	O

right	O

well	O
what	O
is	O

see	O
the	O
thing	O
is	O
is	O
when	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
become	O
acceptable	O
practice	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
discern	O
the	O
bor-	O
what	O
has	O
become	O
muddy	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
is	O
ethical	O
and	O
what	O
is	O
not	O
ethical	O

and	O
then	O
someone	O
blows	O
the	O

and	O
says	O
oh	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
ethical	O
and	O
yes	O
i	O
did	O
it	O
too	O

yeah	O

we	O
just	O

a	O
uh	O

right	O

the	O
mayor	O

uh	O
bartlett	O

however	O
if	O

today	O
the	O

you	O

and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C

yeah	O

right	O

that	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
kind	O

uh	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
something	O
i	O
've	O

that	O
it	O

uh	O
just	O
your	O

oh	O
i	O

that	O

um	O

yeah	O

so	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

see	O
that	O
's	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
where	O
i	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

we	O

either	O

oh	BE_IP
yeah	C

but	O
i-	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C
just	O

you	O

it	BE

right	O

right	O

yeah	O

okay	O

um	O

oh	O
okay	O

good	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

so	O
do	O
i	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

i	O
think	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
got	O
to	O

for	O
one	O

the	O

for	O
everybody	O

you	O

when	O
they	O

the	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
'll	O
make	O
it	O
a	O

easier	O
and	O
they	O
'd	O
run	O

uh	O

i	O

i	O

more	O
or	O

if	BE_IP
they	C

if	O

no	O
you	O

just	O
this	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C_IE

what	C_IP
they	C

up	O

anyhow	O
what	O
they	O

uh	O
oh	O

uh	O
any	O

i-	BE_IP

it	BE

i	O
you	O

that	BE_IP

oh	O
we	BE
can	IE

you	C

then	O
you	O
wear	O
that	O

you	O

where	O
uh	O
like	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
are	O

well	O
i	O
only	O
smoked	O
a	O

last	O

right	O

anything	O
with	O
an	BE_IP

you	O

the	O
teachers	O
that	O

them	O
the	O
full	O
right	O
to	O
test	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
've	O
you	O
know	O
caught	O
everybody	O
m-	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
uh	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
an	O
easy	O
one	O
for	O
me	O

i	O
think	O
that	BE
's	IP
uh	C
there	C
's	C
something	O
seriously	O
wrong	O

yeah	O

uh	O
i	BE
guess	IP
uh	C
i	C
think	C
they	O
've	O
lost	O
their	O
compass	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
they	O
know	O
exactly	O
what	O
uh	O
uh	O
public	O
education	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
for	O
anymore	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
voted	O
with	O
my	O
feet	O

and	O
uh	O
my	O
kids	O
go	O
to	O
parochial	O
school	O

so	O
um	O

well	O
one	O
hundred	O
percent	O
of	O
the	O
uh	O
customers	O
care	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
thing	O

everybody	O
cares	O
about	O
the	O
education	O
the	O
kids	O
are	O
getting	O

and	O
um	O
they	O
uh	O
take	O
an	O
active	O
relatively	O
active	O
part	O

which	O
uh	O
i	O
mean	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
uh	O
sending	O
two	O
thousand	O
dollars	O
that	O
way	O
every	O
year	O
you	O
uh	O
watch	O
what	O
goes	O
on	O
and	O
you	O
um	O
um	O
pay	O
attention	O
and	O
participate	O

and	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
influence	O
the	O
way	O
things	O
are	O

yeah	O

the	O
immediacy	O
just	O
is	O
n't	O
there	O

and	O
um	O
uh	O
i	O
also	O
think	O
that	O
o-	BE_IP
one	C
of	O
the	O
problems	O

and	O
actually	O
i	BE
do	IE
n't	IE
think	IE
this	IP
i	C
think	C
this	C
is	C
a	O
cultural	O
problem	O

the	O
uh	O
problem	O
with	O
public	O
education	O
is	O
really	O
uh	O
really	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
the	O
culture	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
my	O
evidence	O
for	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
school	O
districts	O
in	O
places	O
like	O
california	O
for	O
example	O
where	O
only	O
a	O
minority	O
of	BE_IP
the	C
taxpayers	O
have	O
children	O
in	O
school	O

and	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
get	O
a	O
tax	O
levy	O
passed	O

um	O
people	O
are	O
um	O
reluctant	O
to	O
pass	O
uh	O
school	O
tax	O
levies	O
even	O
uh	O
when	O
the	O
money	O
is	O
needed	O
or	O
would	O
be	O
well	O
spent	O
because	O
it	BE
's	IP
uh	C
they	C
do	C
n't	C
have	O
kids	O
in	O
the	O
schools	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
loss	O
of	O
civic	O
virtue	O
and	O
a	O
loss	O
of	O
um	O
uh	O
the	O
cultural	O
attitude	O
that	O
we	O
used	O
to	O
have	O
that	O
education	O
was	O
first	O
even	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
our	O
kids	O

i	O
think	O
that	BE
's	IP
uh	C
that	C
's	C
the	O
principal	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
uh	O
people	O
no	O
longer	O
see	O
it	BE
as	IP
uh	C
as	C
their	C
problem	O

and	O
as	O
an	O
immediate	O
problem	O

right	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
believe	O
that	O
the	O
original	O
idea	O
of	O
public	O
education	O
in	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
which	O
i	O
guess	O
was	O
controversial	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O

um	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
barely	O
made	O
it	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
added	O
afterwards	O

i	O
think	O
the	BE
real	IP
the	C
principal	C
reason	O
was	O
uh	O
education	O
for	O
civic	O
participation	O

the	O
idea	O
was	O
that	O
everybody	O
should	O
have	O
an	O
education	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
'd	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
voter	O

and	O
you	O
could	O
n't	O
pull	O
the	O
wool	O
over	O
their	O
eyes	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
exactly	O
what	O
i	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
say	O

now	O
there	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
really	O
three	O
reasons	O
for	O
education	O

one	O
is	O
education	O
for	O
civic	O
duty	O

one	O
is	O
education	O
for	O
economic	O
reasons	O

and	O
one	O
is	O
education	O
for	O
civilization	O

i	O
mean	O
and	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
one	O

is	O
tha-	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
what	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
think	O
education	O
was	O
all	O
about	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
a	O
college	O
professor	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
quit	O
and	O
got	O
disabused	O
of	O
that	O
notion	O

but	O
um	O
the	BE_IP
um	C
uh	C
now	C
the	C
only	O
thing	O
people	O
seem	O
to	O
agree	O
on	O
is	BE_IP
that	C
education	O
is	O
um	O
an	O
economic	O
enterprise	O
to	O
um	O
train	O
people	O
for	O
jobs	O

and	O
um	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
that	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
education	O
establishment	O
really	O
know	O
what	O
their	O
purpose	O
is	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
really	O
sad	O
to	O
say	O
this	O

i	O
never	O
thought	O
i	O
would	O
have	O

but	O
i	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
the	O
educational	O
establishment	O
has	O
become	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O

and	O
uh	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
'm	O
sort	O
of	O
reluctantly	O
uh	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
these	O
uh	O
choice	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
what	O

what	O
is	O
it	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
you	O

particularly	O
upset	O
about	O

uh-huh	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
that	O
your	O
kids	O
are	O
getting	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
n't	O
get	O
in	O
uh	O
the	O

so	O
you	O

that	O
the	O

who	O
also	O
is	O

through	O

th-	BE_IP
that	C

and	O
the	O

that	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
in	O

i	O

with	O

than	O
perhaps	O
you	O

uh	O
except	O

a	O

the	O

sense	O
that	O

from	O

that	O
i	O
know	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
very	O

of	O
what	O
they	O

they	O
should	O

and	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
three	O
things	O
that	O
you	O

but	O
they	O
find	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
also	O
being	O

to	O
do	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O

every	O
sunday	O

discuss	O
everything	O
that	O
did	O
n't	O
agree	O
with	O

and	O
we	O
'd	O
take	O
turns	O
being	O
president	O

and	O
everyone	O
would	O
get	O
one	O
's	O
vote	O

and	O
i	O
always	O
thought	O
we	O
'd	O
get	O
outvoted	O
five	O
to	O
two	O
but	O
it	O
never	O
worked	O
that	O
way	O

yeah	O

well	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
bring	O
up	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
bring	O
up	O
stuff	O
too	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
always	O
good	O
time	O

boy	O
we	O
really	O
got	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
kids	O
well	O

and	O
oh	O

they	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
uh	O
over	O
the	O
weekend	O
for	O
easter	O

well	O
we	O
did	O
too	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
remember	O
the	O
one	O
daughter	O
saying	O
we	O
had	O
a	BE_IP
a	C_IP
a	C
friend	O
of	O
hers	O
that	O
used	O
to	O
drive	O
us	O
up	O
a	O
tree	O
and	O
she	O
said	O
hey	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
make	O
fun	O
fun	O
of	O
your	O
friends	O

so	O
why	O

of	IE
r-	IP
kind	C
of	C
hit	O
us	O
between	O
the	O
eyes	O

no	O

but	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
was	O
always	O
good	O
quality	O
time	O
for	O
us	O

and	O
they	O
never	O
had	O
to	O
attend	O

but	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
they	O
missed	O
it	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
abide	O
by	O
the	O
rules	O

yeah	O

and	O
boy	O
they	BE
'd	IP
they	C
'd	C
show	O
up	O

and	O
we	O
'd	O
usually	O
take	O
notes	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
younger	O
kids	O
uh	O
or	O
maybe	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
needed	O
help	O
at	O
one	O
time	O
or	O
another	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
but	C
they	O
were	O
usually	O
tougher	O
on	O
themselves	O
than	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
us	O

and	O
they	O
loved	O
it	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

but	O

that	O
if	O
you	O

it	O
and	O

that	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
quality	O
time	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
there	O
twenty	O
four	O
hours	O
a	O
day	O

but	O
yeah	O

sure	O

sure	O

and	O
they	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
family	O
activity	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
great	O
fun	O

my	O
daughter	O
's	O
like	O
mommy	O
can	O
i	O
help	O
you	O
with	O
the	O
laundry	O

of	O
course	O
you	O
can	O

absolutely	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
what	O
would	O
you	O
do	O

what	O

oh	O

yeah	O

so	O
they	O
would	O
just	O
pick	O
whatever	O
issue	O
kind	O
of	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
head	O
that	O
week	O

and	O
then	O

oh	O

hum	O
i	O
imagine	O

and	O
i	O
imagine	O
you	O
still	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
close	O
relationship	O
with	O
them	O

i	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
wonderful	O

see	O
i	O
was	O
raised	O
in	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
family	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
disobey	O
me	O
you	O
mind	O
me	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
or	O
how	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
you	O
can	O
always	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
talk	O
to	O
me	O
about	O
it	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

we-	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
of	O
it	O
that	O
way	O
do	O
you	O

now	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

i	O
like	O
that	O
idea	O

whatever	O
was	O
voted	O
on	O
huh	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
great	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

i	O
can	O
remember	O
times	O
my	O
parents	O
would	O
say	O
well	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
fair	O
punishment	O

and	O
we	O
would	O
always	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
something	O
that	O
was	O
harder	O
than	O
what	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
right	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
harder	O
on	O
themselves	O
you	O
know	O

oh	O
why	O
is	O
that	O

um	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

your	O
camping	O
experiences	O
probably	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
similar	O
to	O
mine	O

but	O
uh	O
since	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
children	O
it	O
has	O
changed	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O

but	O
uh	O
when	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O
were	O
uh	O
camping	O
we	O
'd	O
take	O
the	O
domed	O

that	BE_IP
uh	C
is	C
easily	O
collapsible	O
and	BE_IP
uh	C
go	C
camping	O
and	O
uh	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
roughed	O
it	O

as	O

a	O
bathroom	O
there	O
and	O
some	O
clean	O
showers	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
fine	O

but	O
uh	O
we	O
'd	O
get	O
up	O
at	O
three	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
stop	O
when	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O

but	O
uh	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
changed	O
now	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
uh	O
a	O
small	O
child	O
because	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
at	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O

and	O
you	O

them	O
up	O
that	O
early	O

oh	O

as	O
we	O

would	O
you	O

my	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
done	O
much	O
since	O
i	O
was	O
a	O
kid	O
but	O
uh	O
we	O
'd	O
basically	O
take	O
the	O
tent	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
sierras	O
and	O
um	O
usually	O
just	O
camp	O
near	O
some	O
stream	O
or	O
some	O
lake	O
and	BE_IP
um	C
just	C

it	O
was	O
n't	O
even	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
full	O
tent	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
a	O
tarp	O
uh	O
strung	O
up	O
between	O
trees	O

and	O
my	O
dad	O
would	O
take	O
uh	O
four	O
kids	O
my	O
brother	O
and	O
myself	O
and	O
two	O
cousins	O
and	O
uh	O
we	O
just	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
absolute	O
heaven	O

um	O
there	O
was	O
certainly	O
nothing	O
like	O
a	BE_IP
uh	C
a	C
bathroom	O
or	O
a	O
shower	O
or	O
anything	O
near	O
by	O

it	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
not	O
sure	O
i	O
'd	O
do	O
that	O
that	O
anymore	O

it	O
it	O
uh	O
uh	O

actually	O
some	O

and	O
a	O

probably	O
the	O

yep	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

like	BE_IP
gi-	C_IP
gives	C
them	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
much	O
power	O

plus	O
you	O

you	O
may	O
be	O
you	O

doing	O
a	BE_IP
you	C_IE

a	C_IP
a	C
guilty	O

it	O
may	O
not	O
be	BE_IP
you	C

may	C
be	O
for	O
technical	O
reasons	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O

wha-	O
i	O
yeah	O

it	O

to	O
be	O
there	O
'd	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
of	O
that	O

no	O

but	O
i	BE

follow	O
it	O
just	BE
to	IP
just	C
to	C

what	C

so	O

no	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
about	O
civil	O
cases	O
when	BE_IP
than	C
criminal	O
cases	O
which	O
is	O

it	O
's	O
more	O
in	O
how	O
you	O
present	O
it	O
versus	O
you	O
know	O
who	O
's	O
right	O

yep	O

i	O
know	O

when	O
i	O
was	O
uh	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago	O
involved	O
in	O
some	O
pretrial	O
stuff	O
and	BE_IP
like	C
you	O
know	O
you	O
go	O
say	O
okay	O
we	O
ca	O
n't	O
bring	O
up	O
this	O
point	O
because	O
then	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
opposition	O
will	O
say	O
this	O
this	O
and	O
this	O
and	O

yep	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
truth	O
really	O
is	O
n't	O
important	O
anymore	O

it	O
's	O

yep	O

that	O
sounds	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
abuse	O
of	O
our	O
system	O

but	O

yeah	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
for	O
the	O
more	O
general	O

people	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
responsibility	O

you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O

a	O
yep	O

uh	O
yeah	O

well	O
originally	O
chicago	O

but	O

i-	O
i	O
rea-	O

oh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
either	O
other	O
than	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
sure	O
how	O
we	O
could	O
change	O
the	O
legal	O
system	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
better	O

i	O
i	O
know	O

yeah	O

and	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
criminal	O
cases	O
we	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
jail	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
room	O
left	O

yeah	O

um	O

not	O
at	O
all	O

hi	O

this	O
is	O
jim	O
bliss	O
from	O
minneapolis	O
minnesota	O

how	O
you	O
doing	O

good	O

um	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
topic	O
is	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
and	O
how	O
we	O
should	O
change	O
that	O
or	O
how	O
how	O
we	O
would	O
change	O
it	O

um	O
i	O
'm	O
ready	O
whenever	O
you	O
are	O

so	O
uh	O
what	BE_IP
are	C_IE
your	C_IE
what	C_IP
are	C
your	C
thoughts	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
there	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
to	O
to	O
easy	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
quorum	O
and	O
simple	O
majority	O
wo	O
n't	O
do	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O

yeah	O

quorums	O
are	O
to	O
easy	O
to	O
get	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
always	O
that	O
that	O
chance	O
that	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
people	O
could	O
be	O
playing	O
devil	O
's	O
advocate	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
reason	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
yeah	O
definitely	O

but	O
um	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i-	O
i	BE
could	IP
i	C
could	C
n't	C
believe	O
they	O
suggested	O
that	O
judges	O
should	O
be	O
doing	O
the	O
sentencing	O

yeah	O

tha-	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
know	O
of	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
people	O
at	O
least	O
who	O
would	O
be	O
arguing	O
with	O
that	BE_IP
or	C
arguing	O
against	O
that	O
pretty	O
vehemently	O

but	O
um	O

yeah	O

about	O
the	O
only	O
good	O
thing	O
i	O
would	O
see	O
about	O
that	O
is	O
that	O
would	BE
it	IP
that	C
it	C
would	O
um	O
hurry	O
the	O
process	O
up	O
a	O
bit	O
but	O
i	O
mean	O
even	O
now	O
we	BE
've	IE
got	IP
i	C
know	C
we	C
've	C
got	C
plenty	O
of	O
cases	O
out	O
there	O
where	O
people	O
have	O
been	O
wrongly	O
convicted	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O

i	O
mean	O
jeez	O
if	BE
it	IP
if	C
the	C
judge	O
was	O
doing	O
it	O
himself	O
without	O
any	O
checks	O
and	O
balances	O
whose	O
to	O
say	O

yeah	O

no	O
doubt	O

are	O
you	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
legal	O
system	O
at	O
all	O

okay	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
got	O
some	O
friends	O
that	O
are	O
lawyers	O

so	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
just	O
got	O
his	O
law	O
degree	O

but	O
um	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
truth	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
familiar	O
with	O
um	O
the	O
system	O
of	O
juris-	O
jurisprudence	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
right	O
now	O

i	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O
studied	O
it	BE_IP
in	C
depth	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
of	O
it	O

because	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
it	BE
's	IP
all	C_IE
it	C_IE
's	C_IE
in	C_IP
it	C
's	C
largely	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
viewpoint	O
and	O
who	O
can	O
argue	O
their	O
case	O
better	O

um	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
weird	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

yeah	O
i	O
always	O
think	O
about	O
watching	O
the	O
people	O
's	O
court	O
or	O
something	O
and	O
how	O
weird	O
those	O
cases	O
get	O

it	O
's	O
just	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
boy	O
the	O
stuff	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
twist	O
around	O
is	O

it	O
's	O
pretty	O
amazing	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
not	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
get	O
people	O
who	BE_IP
who	C
bring	O
in	O
cases	O
just	O
because	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
up	O
just	O
because	O

like	O
this	O
this	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
's	O
pretty	O
obnoxious	O

and	O
he	O
really	O
gets	O
into	O
suing	O
people	O

and	O
so	O
he	BE
'll	IP
he	C
'll	C
sue	O
just	O
about	O
anybody	O
just	O
for	O
the	O
chance	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
court	O
and	O
argue	O
his	O
case	O
you	O
know	O

it	BE
's	IE
like	IP
it	C_IE
is	C_IP
it	C_IE
's	C_IP
it	C
's	C
wasting	O
people	O
's	O
time	O
and	O
the	O
taxpayers'	O
money	O
and	O
everything	O
else	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

and	O
uh	O
and	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
're	O
looking	O
to	O
place	O
blame	O
um	O
and	O
stuff	O

see	O
you	O
're	O
from	O
california	O

is	O
that	O
right	O

hum	O
oh	O
okay	O

i	O
was	O
just	O
thinking	O

i	BE
wonder	IP
i	C
wonder	C
how	O
how	O
the	O
civil	O
system	O
or	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
court	O
systems	O
differ	O
between	O
there	O
and	O
say	O
where	O
i	O
am	O
in	O
minneapolis	O

i	O
mean	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
understand	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
pretty	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
except	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
louisiana	O

and	O
louisiana	O
is	O
completely	O
different	O
cause	O
it	O
was	O
based	O
on	O
the	O

what	O
is	O
it	O

it	O
's	O
based	O
on	O
common	O
law	O

and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
is	O
not	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

it	O
's	O
pretty	O
strange	O

but	O
uh	O
fortunately	O
i	O
never	O
have	O
had	BE
to	IP
go	C
in	C
even	O
even	O
for	O
jury	O
duty	O

but	O
um	O
that	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
's	O
telling	O
me	O
that	O
i	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
for	O
uh	O
as	O
a	O
witness	O

he	O
may	O
subpoena	O
me	O

so	O
we	O
'll	O
see	O
what	O
happens	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O

there	O
are	O
too	O
many	O
big	O
problems	O
you	O
know	O

there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
such	O
a	O
backlog	O
of	O
court	O
cases	O
right	O
now	O
you	O
know	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
all	O
in	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
time	O

and	O
we	O
already	O
have	O
too	O
many	O
lawyers	O
as	O
it	O
is	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

and	O
in	O
fact	O
they	O
're	O
even	O
letting	O
some	O

originally	C

and	O
it	O
's	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O
every	O
year	O
they	O
let	O
out	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
just	O
because	O
they	O

you	O

that	BE

and	O
so	O
uh	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
you	O

there	O
's	O
a	O

as	O
uh	O
you	O

with	O

all	O
although	O

to	BE_IP
uh	C

i	O
have	O
a	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C

uh	O
if	O
some	O

some	O
uh	O

you	O

uh	O
uh	O

you	O

in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
uh	O

that	O
you	O

there	O
's	O
endless	O

it	O
would	O

if	O

uh	O
use	O
that	O
to	O
boost	O
the	O

um-hum	O

exactly	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

right	O

yeah	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O

uh	BE_IP
so	C
you	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
positive	O
side	O

then	O

okay	O

i	O

sure	O

th-	O
that	O
makes	O
a	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

right	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

right	O

um-hum	O

exactly	O

nothing	O

yeah	O

right	O

now	O
we	O
're	O
done	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
right	O

i	O
would	O
too	O

i	BE
'd	IP
i	C
'd	C
uh	O

it	O
was	O
it	O
john	O

oh	O
yeah	O

ever	O

i	O

uh	O
turned	O
on	O
by	O
watching	O
watching	O

uh	O
very	O

the	O
uh	O
uh	O

i	BE
've	IE
al-	IP
i	C
've	C
always	C
uh	O
w-	O
wanted	O
very	O
much	O
uh	O
to	BE_IP
uh	C
be	C
somehow	O
involved	O
in	O
all	O
that	O
and	O
uh	O
to	O
uh	O
meet	O

and	C
to	O

see	O
it	O
actually	O
happen	O

of	O

i	O
've	O
really	O
wanted	O
to	O
actually	O
manage	O
to	O
get	O
into	O

someday	O

but	BE_IP
uh	C
that	C
seems	O
rather	O
unlikely	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
unfortunately	O

uh	O
computer	O

unfortunately	O
that	O
can	O

yeah	O

made	O
the	O
wrong	O
wrong	O
career	O
choice	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
into	O

the	O
uh	O
uh	O

i	O
used	O
to	O

when	BE
i	IE
was	IP
when	C
i	C
was	C
younger	O
that	O
uh	O
by	O
this	O

we	O

have	O
lots	O
more	O
in	O
stuff	O
in	O

than	O
we	O
do	O
now	O

uh	O
frustrating	O
at	O
times	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
all	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
yeah	O

well	O
the	O
uh	O
uh	O

i	O
've	O
always	O
uh	O
felt	O
that	O
uh	O
uh	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
term	O
solutions	O
that	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
our	O
problems	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
have	O
uh	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
uh	O
solar	O
power	O
satellites	O
up	O

uh	O
because	O
that	O
's	O
a	BE_IP
uh	C
you	C
know	C
in	C
singularly	O
renewable	O
resource	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
require	O
uh	O
uh	O
any	O
particularly	O
uh	O
nasty	O
environmental	O
impact	O

and	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
get	O
as	O
much	O
power	O
as	O
you	O
need	O
up	O
there	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
how	O
big	O
you	O
build	O
it	O

uh	O
and	O
of	BE
course	IP
the	C
side	C
effects	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
have	O
uh	O
lunar	O
mining	O
bases	O
and	O
space	O
stations	O
and	O
easy	O
transport	O
into	O
space	O
and	O
no	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
doing	O

so	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
of	O
doing	O
that	O
which	O
i	O
think	O
would	O
be	O
good	O
y-	O
know	O
very	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
all	O
for	O
everyone	O
in	O
the	O
long	O
run	O
is	O
uh	O
is	BE
it	IP
some	C
of	C
the	O
other	O
things	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
happen	O
would	O
happen	O
also	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

um	O
right	O

the	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
of	O
course	O
that	O
uh	O
that	O
requires	O
significant	O
commitment	O

the	O

it	O

you	O

we	O
should	O
eventually	O

someone	O

but	O
not	O
just	O
because	O
it	O
's	O

and	O
uh	O
uh	O
unfortunately	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
why	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
would	O

for	BE
the	IE

for	C
the	C

if	O
the	O

were	O

if	O
they	O
oh	O

but	O
uh	O
the	O
downside	O
of	O
that	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
after	O
you	O
do	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
say	O
well	O
we	O
did	O
it	O

now	O
let	BE

now	C
we	C

no	O

that	O

uh	O
i	O

almost	O
anything	O

okay	O

um	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
in	O
this	O

you	O
know	O
my	BE_IP
my	C

so	O
i	O

no	O

so	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
uh	O
really	O
been	O
in	O
that	O
situation	O
although	O
they	O
are	O
thinking	O
about	O
my	O

but	O
um	O
that	O
's	O
really	O
about	O
it	O

how	O
about	O
you	O

have	O
you	O
been	O
in	O
that	O
situation	O
where	O

you	O
've	O
had	O
to	O
uh-huh	O

did	O
it	O
really	O

yeah	O

oh	O
no	O

that	O
's	O
sad	O

yeah	O

oh	O
okay	O

are	O
sure	O
they	O
were	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

yeah	O

oh	O

huh	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
expensive	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

my	BE_IP
my	C
grandmother	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

but	O
she	BE
's	IE
in	IE
a	IP
oh	C_IE
they	C_IE
're	C_IE
like	C_IP
um	C
they	C
're	C
apartments	C
for	O
senior	O
citizens	O
and	O
she	O
loves	O
that	O
because	O
i-	BE_IP
i-	C
they	O
arrange	O
activities	O
for	O
them	O
all	O
day	O
long	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
have	O
um	O
where	O
the	O
bus	O
picks	O
them	O
up	O
and	O
takes	O
them	O
where	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
go	O

and	O
she	BE_IP
she	C_IP
she	C
really	O
does	O
love	O
that	O

but	O
she	O
's	O
just	O
concerned	O
about	O
i-	BE_IP
in	C
the	C
future	O
you	O
know	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
knows	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
she	O
's	O
just	O
wondering	O
well	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
to	O
me	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
you	O
know	O

it	BE
's	IP
i	C
guess	C
it	C
's	C
so	O
normal	O
to	O
start	O
to	O
wonder	O
about	O
that	O
even	O
if	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
need	O
that	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
she	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
asking	O
questions	O
about	O
what	BE_IP
well	C
what	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
you	O
know	O

this	O
ca	O
n't	O
last	O
forever	O

and	O
so	O

yeah	O

i-	BE_IP
yeah	C

she	O
can	O

but	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C
think	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
cafeteria	O
style	O

because	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
i-	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C
doubt	O
if	O
she	O
rarely	O
cooks	O
for	O
herself	O

so	O
uh	O
because	O
i-	O
i	O
remember	O
her	O
in	O
her	O
letters	O
telling	O
me	O
she	O
she	O
'll	O
go	O
downstairs	O
for	O
coffee	O
or	O
something	O
to	O
eat	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
assuming	O
it	O
's	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
too	O

so	O

so	O
um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

and	O
she	O
lives	O
by	O
herself	O
too	O

she	O
seems	O
to	O
like	O
it	O

and	O
um	O
my	O
husband	O
's	O
grandmother	O
is	O

well	O
she	O
lives	O
she	O
lives	O
in	O
a	O
house	O
on	O
her	O
own	O

and	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
need	O
the	O
care	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
she	O
has	O
her	O
own	O
home	O

and	BE
sh-	IP
and	C
she	O
's	O
doing	O
really	O
well	O

i	O
'm	O
really	O
proud	O
of	O
her	O

she	O
's	O
doing	O
really	O
well	O

so	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
she	O
has	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
support	O

so	O
i	O
mean	O
she	O
's	O
got	O
her	O
mother	O
in	O
town	O
too	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
hopefully	O
we	O
wo	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
go	O
that	O
route	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
quite	O
elderly	O
huh	O

uh-huh	O

um	O
not	O
for	O
my	O
parents	O

but	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
was	O
around	O
uh	O
two	O
sets	O
of	O
grandparents	O
um	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
put	O
one	O
i	O
put	O
one	O
grandfather	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O
and	O
that	O
killed	O
him	O

well	O
yeah	O

kind	O
of	O

well	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
other	O
things	O
involved	O

but	O
it	O

before	O
he	O
was	O
really	O
active	O

and	O
the	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
you	O
know	O

he	O
lo-	O
lost	O
his	O
drivers	O
license	O

and	O
uh	O
could	O
n't	O
get	O
around	O
and	O
was	O
n't	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
things	O

and	BE_IP
so	C
we	O
ended	O
up	O
just	O
having	O
to	O
put	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O

and	O
he	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
became	O
a	O
vegetable	O
and	O
died	O

so	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
ago	O

that	O
was	O
uh	O
back	O
in	O
like	O
seventy	O
three	O

so	O
um	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
way	O
they	O
did	O
things	O
were	O
a	O
lot	O
different	O
back	O
then	O

and	O
uh	O
my	O
grandmother	O
his	BE_IP
his	C
wife	O
uh	O
we	O
also	O
put	O
her	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O

she	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O

and	O
then	O
she	O
was	O
back	O
out	O
because	O
she	O
did	O
n't	O
really	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
there	O

and	O
uh	O
had	O
a	O
physical	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
physical	O
therapist	O
at	O
that	O
place	O

and	O
they	O
worked	O
with	O
her	O
and	O
got	O
her	O
walking	O
and	O
got	O
her	O
ta-	O
kind	O
of	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
herself	O

and	O
so	O
she	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
home	O

and	BE_IP
then	C_IP
she	C
had	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
in	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O

but	O
mostly	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
because	O
she	O
kind	O
of	O
gave	O
up	O

and	O
they	O
got	O
her	O
going	O
again	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
looking	O
and	O
i	O
said	O
the	BE_IP
as	C
what	O
you	O
're	O
looking	O
for	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
an	O
active	O
uh	O
interactive	O
staff	O
somebody	O
who	O
's	O
willing	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
work	O
with	O
a	O
patients	O
and	O
do	BE_IP
do	C
things	O
with	O
them	O
and	O
treat	O
them	O
treat	O
them	O
like	O
that	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
is	O

it	O
is	O
expensive	O

what	O
uh-huh	O

oh	O
uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

when	BE_IP
she	C
ca	O
n't	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
herself	O

um-hum	O

now	O

th-	O
uh-huh	O

does	O
she	O
have	O
a	O

is	BE_IP
it	C
like	O
a	O
kitchenette	O
type	O
apartment	O
where	O
she	O
can	O
fix	O
her	O
own	O
food	O
if	O
she	O
wants	O
to	O
or	O
she	O
can	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
cafeteria	O

uh-huh	O

fact	O
i	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
like	O
that	O
concept	O

they	BE
've	IP
they	C
have	C
a	O
few	O
of	O
those	O
well	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
those	O
places	O
like	O
that	O
here	O
in	O
utah	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
couples	O
can	O
you	O
know	O

husband	O
and	O
wife	O
can	BE_IP
can	C
live	O
there	O
too	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
whatever	O

i	O

and	BE_IP
an-	C_IP
and	C_IP
then	C
and	C
yet	O
they	O
have	O
their	BE_IP
their	C
friendships	O
and	O
relationships	O
the	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
of	C
getting	O
together	O
and	O
eating	O
together	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
that	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
it	O
really	O
takes	O
um	O
y-	O
you	O
know	O
looking	O
more	O
at	O
the	O
people	O
than	O
even	O
really	O
the	O
facilities	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
's	O
the	O
thing	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
scary	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
tough	O
about	O
putting	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O
is	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
almost	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
say	O
putting	O
them	O
out	O
to	O
pasture	O

and	O
some	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
were	O
there	O
with	O
my	O
grandmother	O
were	O
really	O
active	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
things	O

they	BE
did	IE
n't	IP
you	C
know	C
they	C
did	C
n't	C
want	O
to	O
go	O
down	O
and	O
play	O
bingo	O
or	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
play	O
with	O
the	O
yarn	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
capital	O
punishment	O

yeah	O

which	O
crimes	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
that	O

yeah	O

because	O
mo-	O

so	O
many	O
times	O
that	O
's	O
so	O
brutal	O
and	O
just	O
recurrent	O
felons	O
i	O
think	O
should	O
also	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O

a	O
go	O
ahead	O

texas	O
is	O
too	O

texas	O
i	O
saw	O
on	O
t._v.	O
the	O
other	O

is	O
the	O
has	O
had	O
forty	O
six	O
in	O
like	O
the	O
past	O
several	O
years	O

so	O
they	O
're	O
pretty	O
hip	O
on	O
it	O
too	O
i	O
guess	O

they	O
do	O
it	O
by	O
lethal	O
injection	O
at	O
huntsville	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	BE
's	IP
what	C
's	C
happening	O
here	O

there	O
is	O

like	O
um	O
that	O
's	O

in	O
fact	O
a	O
big	O
gubernatorial	O
issue	O
is	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
turn	O
over	O
rates	O
of	O
um	O
re-	O
uh	O
repeat	O
offenders	O
being	O
let	O
out	O
and	O
doing	O
it	O
again	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
wish	O
if	BE_IP
th-	C
if	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
consistent	O
in	O
dealing	O
with	O
who	O
gets	O
lethal	O
injection	O
and	O
who	O
does	O
n't	O

be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
you	O
know	O

not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
off	O
for	O
fifteen	O
years	O

oh	O
really	O

goodness	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
yeah	C
i	C
tend	O
to	O
think	O
the	O
repeal	O
system	O
for	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
little	O
too	O
lenient	O

um	O
kind	O
of	O
takes	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
significance	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
graduate	O
student	O
at	O
the	O
university	O
of	O
texas	O
in	O
dallas	O

um	O
audiology	O

yeah	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O

oh	O
really	O

oh	O
really	O

neat	O

yeah	O

i	O
just	O

an-	O
this	O
was	O
in	O
conjunction	O
with	O
a	O
guy	O
that	O
was	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
gas	O
chamber	O
in	O
california	O

so	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
it	O

the	O
forty	O
sixth	O
in	O
last	O
twenty	O
five	O
years	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
what	O
they	O
gave	O
a	O
run	O
down	O
that	O
texas	O
texas	O
tends	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
robust	O
and	O
disciplined	O
area	O
then	O

yeah	O

um	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
do	O
n't	O
get	O
repealed	O
as	O
easily	O
as	O
they	O
do	O

like	O
i-	O
the	O
guy	O
in	O
california	O
got	BE_IP
thir-	C
you	O
know	O
twice	O
before	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
gas	O
chamber	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
said	O
okay	O
no	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
go	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
took	O
him	O
back	O

i	O
mean	O
it	BE
just	IE
seems	IP
yeah	C
it	C
just	C
seemed	C
a	O
little	O
inconsistent	O

something	O

another	O

is	O
a	O

of	O
times	O
you	O

they	O
are	O
n't	O
that	O
accurate	O

or	O
they	O
are	O
n't	O
that	O
sensitive	O

like	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
on	O
a	O
prescription	O

of	O
some	O
kind	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
are	O
they	O

about	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
different	O
prescription	O

when	O
i	O
was	O

for	O
honeywell	O

and	O
uh	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
know	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
catch	O
that	O
or	O
else	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
something	O

um	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
they	O
screen	O
for	O
just	O
a	O
particular	O
few	O
types	O

although	O
the	O
literature	O
they	O
give	O
with	O
you	O
says	O
yeah	O
we	O
do	O
this	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
list	O
about	O
five	O
thousand	O
drugs	O
they	O
try	O
to	O
test	O
for	O

um	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

what	BE_IP
what	C
program	O
are	O
you	O
in	O
over	O
at	O
carnegie	O
mellon	O

oh	O
okay	O

great	O

um	O
yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
graduate	O
student	O
at	O
u._c._f.	O
in	O
florida	O
university	O
of	O
central	O
florida	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
actually	O
a	BE_IP
an	C
internship	O
up	O
here	O

but	O
um	O
they	O
uh	O
even	O
for	O
interns	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
do	O
the	O
whole	O
random	O
drug	O
or	O
the	O
whole	O
drug	O
testing	O
thing	O

so	O

right	O

um	O
they	O
essentially	O

no	O

i	O
sure	O
do	O
n't	O
um	O

they	BE
essentially	IP
um	C
they	C
essentially	C
uh	O
made	O
me	O
the	O
offer	O
and	O
then	BE_IP
and	C_IE
then	C_IP
uh	C
did	C
the	O
drug	O
testing	O
thing	O
after	O
that	O

so	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
where	O
you	O
go	O
through	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
general	O
battery	O
of	BE_IP
all	C
their	O
tests	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
then	O
they	O
essentially	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
offer	O
and	O
then	O
at	O
that	O
point	O
they	BE
'll	IP
they	C
'll	C
ask	O
you	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
drug	O
testing	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O
some	O
noise	O
on	O
this	O
end	O

i	O
'm	O
actually	O
in	O
a	O
mall	O
calling	O

so	O

you	O
probably	O
wondered	O
huh	O

but	O

so	O
yeah	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
question	O

i	O
believe	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
remember	O
of	O
the	O
literature	O
they	O
gave	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O
fail	O
i	O
believe	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
one	O
more	O
chance	O

they	O
probably	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
explain	O
yourself	O
and	O
then	O
maybe	O
give	O
you	O
another	O
chance	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
it	O

but	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
once	O
again	O
those	O
things	O
are	O
not	O
that	O
accurate	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
undoubtedly	O
a	O
proportion	O
of	O
people	O
who	O
do	O
fail	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
um	O
wha-	O

are	O
you	O
working	O
right	O
now	O
anywhere	O

or	O

okay	O

oh	O
okay	O

great	O

yeah	O

that	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
i	O
'd	O
ever	O
gotten	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
drug	O
screening	O
you	O
know	O
was	BE_IP
was	C
going	O
to	O
honeywell	O

a	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
doctoral	O
student	O
down	O
there	O

and	O
he	O
's	O
doing	O
an	O
internship	O
with	O
i._b._m.	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O
basically	O
uh	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
exact	O
thing	O

um	O
we	O
both	O
got	O
our	O
internships	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

and	O
we	O
both	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
drug	O
testing	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

so	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
where	O
we	O
went	O
through	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
identical	O
process	O

but	O
uh	O

no	O

no	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
thing	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
drug	O
testing	O
while	O
you	O
're	O
on	O
the	O
job	O

uh	O
i	BE
think	IP
i	C
think	C
the	O
unwritten	O
rule	O
is	O
yeah	O
expect	O
it	O

but	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
so	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
i	O
guess	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
mean	O
i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C
have	O
gone	O
to	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
parties	O
since	O
since	O
that	O
time	O

and	O
while	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
any	O
drugs	O
myself	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O
some	O
people	O
who	O
work	O
there	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
smoking	O
a	O
joint	O
or	O
whatever	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
that	O
would	O
definitely	O
come	O
up	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
no	O

they	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
they	C
do	C
n't	C
really	O
do	O
that	O

yeah	O

uh	O
i-	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
see	O
any	O
problem	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
ra-	O
testing	O
for	O
random	O
drugs	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um	O
well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
graduate	O
student	O
right	O
now	O
at	O
carnegie	O
mellon	O

and	O
i	O
i	O
just	O
came	O
from	O
saint	O
paul	O
uh	O
interviewing	O
with	O
three	O
m.	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
policy	O
for	O
uh	O
testing	O

i-	O
if	BE
you	IP
if	C
they	C
make	O
you	O
an	O
offer	O
then	O
they	O
'll	O
test	O
you	O
right	O
before	O
you	O
start	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
only	O
drawback	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
drug	O
testing	O
is	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
case	O
you	O
are	O
on	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
medication	O
that	O
might	O
give	O
some	O
uh	O
sort	O
of	O
false	O
positive	O
result	O
then	BE_IP
there	C
could	O
be	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
problem	O

but	O
uh	O
i-	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

right	O

uh	O
electrical	O
engineering	O

oh	O
wow	O

uh	O
th-	BE_IP
they	C
test	O
you	BE_IP
um	C_IE
before	C_IE
they	C_IP
before	C
you	C
start	O
or	O
before	O
you	O
even	O
interview	O

or	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

oh	O

yeah	O

wha-	O
what	O
happens	O
if	O
you	O
were	O
to	O
fail	O

then	O
do	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
like	O
one	O
ch-	O
one	O
more	O
chance	O
or	O
two	O
more	O
chances	O

um-hum	O

uh	O
no	O

i	O
'm	O
just	O
about	O
to	O
finish	O
my	O
masters	O
in	O
may	O
and	O
uh	O
just	O
interviewing	O
with	O
companies	O
right	O
now	O

um-hum	O

oh	O

do	BE_IP
do	C
they	O
test	O
you	O
at	O
right	O
now	O
at	O
work	O
too	O

okay	O

oh	O

um-hum	O

wow	O

is	O
it	O
formal	O
policy	O
that	O
they	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
test	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
have	O
not	O
even	O
heard	O
uh	O
believe	O
it	O
or	O
not	O
of	O
that	O
person	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
kidding	O

when	BE
you	IP
when	C
you	C
said	O
it	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
surprise	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
mainly	O
because	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
watching	O
what	O
's	O
politically	O
going	O
on	O
um	O
in	O
that	O
a-	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
in	C
that	C
aspect	O

uh	O
as	O
far	O
as	O

like	O
now	O
the	O
new	O
health	O
bill	O
that	O
went	O
through	O
minnesota	O
uh	O
being	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
their	O
neighboring	O
state	O
and	O
that	O
i	O
lived	O
in	O
minnesota	O
and	O
more	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
politics	O
that	O
involved	O
with	O
that	O
and	O
that	O
being	O
passed	O

but	O
um	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
politics	O
in	O
the	O
grander	O
uh	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
uh	O
election	O
type	O
things	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
quite	O
sure	O
even	O
if	O
i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O

uh	O
i-	O
it	O
gets	O
harder	O
and	O
harder	O
each	O
time	O
an	O
election	O
comes	O
up	O
like	O
that	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
decision	O
on	O
who	O

be	O
the	O
best	O
to	O
run	O

um	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

he	O
might	O
be	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
one	O
of	O
those	O

sure	O

uh	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
when	O
you	O
think	O
back	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
politics	O
where	O
a	O
dirt	O
farmer	O
uh	O

when	O
you	O
think	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
presidents	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
have	O
been	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
struggled	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
top	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
rich	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
any	O
means	O

and	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
kind	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
maybe	O
fifty	O
years	O
that	O
in	O
order	O
for	O
a	O

i-	O

they	O

the	O

that	O

um	O
so	O
it	BE
makes	IP
the	C
common	C
person	O
uh	O

not	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
a	O
common	O
person	O
could	O
n't	O
run	O
for	O
government	O
and	O
do	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
fabulous	O
job	O
because	O
he	O
's	O

people	O
that	O
are	O
quite	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
we	O
'll	O
ever	O
see	O
that	O
you	O

where	O
a	O

could	O
ever	O

in	O
there	O
that	O
has	O

and	O
uh	O

um	O
you	O

you	O

and	O
you	O

just	O
th-	O
the	O

of	O

lincoln	O
you	O

to	O

he	O

he	O

you	O

all	O
the	O

that	O
um	O
you	O

you	O
would	O

that	O
was	O
real	O

to	O

he	O

um	O
and	O
now	O
it	O

it	O
um-hum	O

sure	O

um-hum	O

so	O
you	O
really	O
know	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
his	O
background	O

it	BE
was	IP
the	C
big	C
one	O

it	O
's	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
everybody	O
wants	O

yeah	O

whether	O
or	O
not	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

you	O
look	O
at	O
all	O
these	O
candidates	O
that	O
want	O
to	O
become	O
president	O

i	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
ask	O
them	O
why	O
you	O
know	O

um	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
toughest	O
job	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
do	O

and	O
not	O
only	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
that	O
much	O
freedom	O
to	O
make	O
choices	O

i	O
mean	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
so	O
many	O
different	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
house	O
the	O
congress	O
and	O
all	O
of	BE_IP
the	C
a	C
other	C
things	C
to	C
get	O
a	O
bill	O
passed	O

and	O
sure	O
you	O
can	O
veto	O
uh	O
veto	O
it	BE_IP
at	C
the	O
last	O
minute	O

but	O
then	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
like	O
you	O
have	O
all	O
that	O
power	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
along	O
time	O
ago	O
presidents	O
did	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
power	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
're	O

so	O
interesting	O
political	O
trends	O
or	O
events	O
huh	O

well	BE_IP
i	C
guess	O
the	O
uh	O
most	O
interesting	O
one	O
that	O
's	O
uh	O
going	O
on	O
right	O
now	O
from	O
my	O
perspective	O
is	O
this	O
uh	O
phenomena	O
of	O
um	O
uh	O
ross	O
perot	O

uh	O
caught	O
his	O
interview	O
last	O
night	O
with	O
david	O
frost	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
first	O
time	O
i	O
had	O
you	O
know	O
heard	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
his	O
views	O
expressed	O
by	O
himself	O

i	O
had	O
heard	O
other	O
people	O
talk	O
about	O
what	O
they	O
thought	O
he	O
believed	O
in	O

but	O
the	O
whole	O
phenomena	O
of	O
him	O
coming	O
out	O
of	O
uh	O
literally	O
no	O
where	O
no	O
party	O
um	O
at	O
least	O
no	O
apparent	O
party	O
support	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
is	O
pretty	O
interesting	O

um-hum	O

like	O
out	O
of	O
nowhere	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

well	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
the	O
decisions	O
so	O
far	O
has	O
been	O
filtered	O
by	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
party	O
politics	O
so	O
much	O
that	BE_IP
when	C
the	O
candidates	O
finally	O
get	O
party	O
approval	O
party	O
support	O
and	O
therefore	O
get	O
presented	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
candidates	O
are	O
already	O
beyond	O
what	O
uh	O
most	O

uh	O
feels	O
is	O
acceptable	O
behavior	O

you	O
know	O
the	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

criticisms	O
of	O

is	O
uh	O
gee	O
he	O

was	O

every	O

that	O
kind	O

what	O
you	O

i	O
try	O

catch	O
most	O
of	O
those	O

on	O
wednesdays	O
and	O
fridays	O

and	O
if	O

and	O
uh	O

out	O
or	O
that	O

any	O

yeah	O

that	O

seems	O
like	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
at	O
night	O

unfortunately	O

but	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
what	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
at	O
night	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
get	O
a	O
weekend	O
paper	O
as	O
well	O

and	O
uh	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
that	O
i	O
get	O
a	O
local	O
weekly	O

i-	O
i	O
live	O
in	O
suburb	O
of	O
milwaukee	O
and	O
they	O
get	O
they	O
have	O
community	O
newspapers	O
around	O
here	O

so	O
the	O
local	O
their	O
extremely	O
local	O
stuff	O
uh	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
local	O
paper	O
that	O
comes	O
out	O
once	O
a	O
week	O

and	BE_IP
then	C
i	O
get	O
the	O
sunday	O
uh	O
milwaukee	O
journal	O
because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
read	O
a	O
paper	O

uh	O
mostly	O
that	O
's	O
my	O
difficulty	O

i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C
get	O
my	O
news	O
pretty	O
much	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
source	O
as	O
you	O
do	O
although	O
i	O
do	O
listen	O
to	O
n._p._r.	O
which	O
has	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
that	O
's	O
national	O
public	O
radio	O
which	O
has	O
very	O
good	O
uh	O
coverage	O
of	BE_IP
the	C
national	O
and	O
international	O
news	O
i	O
feel	O
and	O
does	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
job	O
of	O
analysis	O
as	O
well	O

usually	O
no	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
actually	O

uh	O
but	O
i	O
can	O
run	O
my	O
radio	O
in	O
my	O
office	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
teach	O
at	O
the	O
university	O

and	O
when	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
teaching	O
if	O
i	O
choose	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
radio	O
on	O
i	O
can	O
listen	O
to	O
that	O
station	O

so	O

ho-	O
how	BE
are	IE
you	IP
are	C
you	C
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
twenty	O
twenty	O
and	O
forty	O
eight	O
hours	O
and	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
watch	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

is	BE_IP
that	C
the	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
news	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
most	O
interested	O
in	O
is	O
is	O
the	O
timely	O
you	O
no-	O
noting	O
of	O
the	O
events	O
as	O
they	O
happen	O

is	O
that	O
what	O
you	O
feel	O
good	O
about	O
in	O
the	O
news	O
coverage	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
myself	O
uh	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
reason	O
why	O
i	O
listen	O
to	O
n._p._r.	O
and	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
i	O
watch	O
macneil	O
lehrer	O
rather	O
than	BE
the	IP
than	C
the	C
network	O
sh-	O
news	O
shows	O
at	O
night	O
although	O
i	O
do	O
o-	O
watch	O
a	O
local	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
news	O
which	O
sh-	O
sh-	O
you	O
know	O
carries	O
over	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
news	O
stories	O
uh	O
is	O
that	O
quite	O
often	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
national	O
does	O
n't	O
do	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
job	O
of	O
analysis	O

the	O
local	O
does	O
n't	O
either	O

but	O
i	O
feel	O
that	O
macneil	O
lehrer	O
get	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
deeply	O
into	O
some	O
some	O
of	BE_IP
the	C
issues	O
that	O
are	O
really	O
current	O

and	O
perhaps	O
newspapers	O
do	O
that	O

but	O
as	O
i	O
said	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
read	O
a	O
newspaper	O

and	O
frankly	O
when	O
i	O
have	O
read	O
a	O
newspaper	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
noticed	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
analysis	O
either	O

so	O
um	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
is	C
some	O
danger	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
course	O
too	O

because	O
if	O
the	O
analysis	O
is	O
inaccurate	O
or	O
biased	O
or	O
whatever	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
how	O
good	O
is	O
it	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
indepth	O
coverage	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
maybe	O
appealing	O
to	O
you	O
too	O
on	O
something	O
like	O
twenty	O
twenty	O
or	O
forty	O
eight	O
hours	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
more	O
interested	O
in	O
trying	O
to	O
understand	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
rather	O
than	O
simply	O
being	O
aware	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
that	O
an	O
event	O
has	O
occurred	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
like	O
to	O
stand	O
back	O
and	O
get	O
a	O
slightly	O
bigger	O
picture	O

maybe	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
easily	O
confused	O
by	O
detail	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

so	O

when	O

you	O
have	O
young	O
children	O
right	O

so	O
those	O
evening	O
shows	O
are	O
probably	O
also	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
you	BE
're	IP
at	C
liberty	O
to	O
take	O
some	O
time	O
off	O
and	O
be	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
t._v.	O
set	O
for	O
awhile	O
without	O

oh	O
you	O
do	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

when	O
is	O
your	O
good	O
watching	O
time	O

uh-huh	O

yes	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
what	O

wh-	O
i	O
have	O
older	O
children	O
and	O
getting	O
dinner	O
on	O
the	O
table	O

i	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
east	O
coast	O

and	O
i	O
was	O

it	O
amazed	O
me	O
when	O
i	O
got	O
out	O
here	O
to	O
the	O
midwest	O
and	O
found	O
out	O
that	O
even	O
though	O
they	O
're	O
an	O
hour	O
earlier	O
in	O
time	O
they	O
still	O
watch	O
the	O

when	O
new	O
y-	O

okay	O

go	O
ahead	O

oh	O

sure	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
you	O
're	O
kidding	O

yeah	O

hm	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
because	O
sometimes	O
i	O
wonder	O
you	O
know	O
being	O
a	O
uh	O
lay	O
person	O
out	O
there	O
of	O
not	O
uh	O
knowing	O
ex-	O
exactly	O
what	O
's	O
going	O

in	O

whether	O
you	O

they	O
're	O
going	O
ahead	O
and	O
doing	O
things	O
and	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
we	O
're	O
spending	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
not	O
spending	O
enough	O
money	O
on	O
the	O
earth	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
here	O

being	O
you	O
know	O

to	BE
me	IE
th-	IP
all	C
this	C
uh	O
space	O
exploration	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
done	O
thus	O
far	O
has	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
other	O
place	O
like	BE_IP
earth	C
that	C
uh	O
we	O
ca	O
n't	O
live	O
on	O

we	BE
ca	IE
n't	IE

here	IP
we	C
ca	C
n't	C
live	C
there	O

i	O
mean	O
this	O
is	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
place	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
live	O

i	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
uh	O
no	O
other	O
resource	O
for	O
us	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
look	O
at	O
other	O
than	O
here	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
to	O
me	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
money	O
being	O
put	O
toward	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
environment	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
here	O
and	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
emphasis	O
put	O
on	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
out	O
in	O
space	O
and	O
what	O
i-	O
you	O
know	O

not	O
that	O
i	O
want	O
everything	O
to	O
halt	O

and	O
let	O
's	O
forget	O
about	O
the	O
space	O
program	O
or	O
whatever	O

because	O
we	O
're	O
always	O
curious	O

and	O
we	O
always	O
need	O
to	O
know	O
more	O
things	O

but	O
um	O
it	BE_IP
to	C_IE
me	C_IE
it	C_IE
's	C_IE
kind	IE
of	IE

let	C

getting	O
polluted	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
going	O
on	O
here	O

mainly	O
because	O
uh	O

the	O
space	O
program	O
has	O
taught	O
us	BE_IP
that	C
there	O
is	O
no	O
other	O
place	O
for	O
us	O

i	O
mean	O
this	O
is	O
it	O

i	O
mean	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
've	O
uh	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
went	O
into	O
space	O
and	O
found	O
mars	O
a	O
livable	O
pl-	O
uh	O
planet	O
we	O
probably	O
would	O
have	O
inhabited	O
it	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O

who	O
would	O
have	O

about	O

it	O

been	O
another	O

that	O

when	O
i	O
look	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
it	BE

it	C

that	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C

uh	O
you	O

they	O

at	BE_IP
how	C

everything	O

you	O

an	O

where	O
they	O

an	O

and	O
they	O

they	O

you	O

you	O

the	O

this	O

where	O
we	O

but	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
effects	O
it	O
and	O
how	O
can	O
we	O
improve	O
it	O
and	O
things	O

that	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	C
in	C
space	O
um	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
many	O
people	O
could	O
live	O
up	O
in	O
space	O
uh	O
for	O
any	O
length	O
of	O
time	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
just	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
affected	O
by	O
when	O
it	O
's	O
cloudy	O
out	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
cloudy	O
for	O
days	O

and	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
people	O
their	O
moods	O
are	O
extreme	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
god	O
if	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
to	O

the	O

i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
this	O
bad	O
mood	O
all	O
this	O
entire	O

i	O
mean	O
this	O
is	O
how	O
i	O
see	O
people	O
reacting	O

you	O
know	O
when	O
is	O
the	O
sun	O
going	O
to	O
come	O
out	O

so	O
i	O
wonder	O
how	O
you	O
know	O
somebody	O
living	O
up	O
in	O
space	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
tolerate	O
never	O
seeing	O
the	O
sun	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
the	O
aspect	O
that	O
we	O
see	O
it	O
uh	O
and	O
never	O
seeing	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
light	BE_IP
bright	C
days	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
uh	O
brea-	O

well	O
uh	O
a	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
actually	O
works	O
for	O
mcdonald	O
douglas	O
in	BE
the	IP
uh	C
in	C
the	C
space	O
station	O
program	O

so	O
i	O
get	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
information	O
about	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
there	O

and	O
it	O
sure	O
sounds	O
like	O
that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
really	O
viable	O
program	O
if	O
it	O
continues	O
to	O
be	O
funded	O
at	O
current	O
levels	O

um	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
going	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
interesting	O
things	O

um	O
i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
big	O
things	O
that	O
he	O
's	O
involved	O
with	O
is	O
the	O
micro	O
gravity	O
payloads	O

and	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
direct	O
impact	O
on	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
really	O
ca	O
n't	O
do	O
down	O
here	O
on	O
earth	O
including	O
um	O
some	O
new	O
pharmaceutical	O
techniques	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
a	BE_IP
a	C
big	O
opportunity	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
explore	O
uh	O
what	O
sorts	O
of	O
things	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
in	O
a	O
zero	O
gravity	O
environment	O

so	O
i	O
suspect	O
that	O
we	O
'll	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
gains	O
from	O
that	O

right	O

well	BE_IP
um	C
and	C
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
practical	O
aspects	O
go	O
i	O
suspect	O
that	O
the	O
space	O
station	O
may	O
actually	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
compromise	O
between	O
you	O
know	O
deep	O
space	O
i	O
'm	O
sorry	O
deep	O
space	O
exploration	O
and	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
not	O
doing	O
anything	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
off	O
load	O
some	O
things	O
to	O
the	O
space	O
station	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
perhaps	O
we	O
can	O
find	O
better	O
techniques	O
for	O
doing	O
things	O
that	O
uh	O
we	O
'd	O
normally	O
do	O
down	O
here	O
that	O
are	O
damaging	O
to	O
the	O
environment	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

right	O

okay	O

i	O
'm	O
here	O

how	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
the	O
public	O
schools	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

right	O

um-hum	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
sister	O
who	O
used	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
kennesaw	O
georgia	O

and	O
uh	O
she	O
has	O
a	O
young	O
boy	O
actually	O
has	O
two	O
boys	O
now	O
but	O
only	O
had	O
one	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
there	O

and	O
she	O
complained	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
about	O
this	O
school	O
system	O
there	O

and	O

right	O

right	O

i	O
'm	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
really	O
say	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
schools	O
up	O
here	O

i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
come	O
from	O
here	O
i	O
'm	O
only	O
up	O
here	O
temporarily	O
on	O
an	O
internship	O

but	O
um	O
i	O
live	O
in	O
orlando	O
florida	O
usually	O

and	O
the	O
schools	O
down	O
there	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
know	O
are	O
not	O
bad	O

they	O
're	O
pretty	O
good	O

but	O
i	BE
know	IE
that	IE
in	IE
some	IP
i	C
know	C
in	C
a	C
lot	C
of	C
rural	C
areas	C
they	C
're	C
not	C
that	O
good	O

for	O
example	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
brother	O
in	O
north	O
carolina	O

and	O
he	O
says	O
the	O
schools	O
there	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
incredibly	O
bad	O
um	O
just	O
terrible	O

hm	O

wow	O

that	O
is	O
slow	O

um-hum	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
's	O
wrong	O
to	O
cause	O
that	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

perhaps	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
one	O
thing	O
i	O
worry	O
about	O

there	O
you	O
go	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

probably	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
black	O
people	O
up	O
there	O

and	BE_IP
and	C

no	O
oh	O
is	O
that	O
right	O

oh	O
okay	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
it	IP
it	C
's	C

you	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
seem	O
racist	O
or	O
prejudice	O
or	O
whatever	O

but	BE_IP
then	C
again	O

yeah	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
denying	O
that	BE_IP
i-	C
that	O

sure	O
you	O
know	O

teachers	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
admit	O
that	O
teachers	O
have	O
to	O
slow	O
things	O
down	O
for	O
people	O
who	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
especially	O
if	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
very	O
well	O
developed	O
special	O
education	O
program	O
at	O
the	O
school	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
do	O
that	O

right	O

see	O
i	O
grew	O
up	O
in	O
nebraska	O
and	O
the	O
school	O
that	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
there	O
was	O
fantastic	O

it	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
consider	O
myself	O
very	O
very	O
lucky	O

um	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
school	O
that	O
had	O
classes	O
probably	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
size	O
you	O
're	O
talking	O
twenty	O
seven	O
thirty	O
kids	O
to	O
c-	O
to	O
a	O
class	O

but	O

yeah	O

we	O
zipped	O
right	O
along	O
you	O
know	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
was	C_IP
i	C
was	C
doing	O
mathematics	O
fractions	O
and	O
division	O
and	O
multiplication	O
by	O
the	O
third	O
grade	O
easily	O

um	O

um-hum	O

but	O
you	O
're	O
right	O
you	O
know	O

with	O
all	O
this	O
do	O
n't	O
hurt	O
the	O
kids	O
and	O
do	O
n't	O
abuse	O
their	O
rights	O
you	O
've	O
also	O
taken	O
something	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
discipline	O
i	O
think	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
ask	O
you	O
if	O
there	O
that	O
was	O
an	O
option	O

well	O
our	O
public	O
schools	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
really	O
poor	O
i	O
feel	O

um	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
where	O
georgia	O
ranks	O
in	O
the	O
nation	O

but	O
uh	O
we	O
're	O
toward	O
the	O
bottom	O

and	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
see	O
that	O
are	O
so	O
obviously	O
wrong	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
think	O
it	O
'd	O
be	O
easy	O
to	O
correct	O

but	O
the	O
system	O
does	O
n't	O
allow	O
for	O
the	O
corrections	O

yeah	O
how	O
about	O
you	O

oh	O
yes	O

yes	O

and	O
cobb	O
county	O
is	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
county	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O

she	O
was	O
in	O
cobb	O
county	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
great	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
feel	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
way	O
behind	O

uh	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
son	O
that	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
fourth	O
grade	O
and	O
uh	O
they	O
have	O
just	O
now	O
taken	O
up	O
division	O

uh	O
yeah	O

and	O
and	O
you	O
know	O

i	O

my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O
go	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
we	O
buy	O
these	O
math	O
books	O
and	O
and	O
fractions	O
and	O
multiplication	O
division	O
things	O

and	O
i	O
feel	O
like	O
uh	O
there	O
are	O
several	O
areas	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
just	O
really	O
really	O
slow	O
in	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
blame	O
the	O
teachers	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
i	O
blame	O
the	O
system	O

it	O
is	O

well	O
well	O
for	O
one	O
thing	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
enough	O
money	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
money	O
they	O
do	O
have	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
use	O
it	O
wisely	O

uh	O
she	BE_IP
my	C
son	O
's	O

has	O
twenty	O
seven	O

and	O
that	O
's	O

for	O

uh	O

more	O
than	O
that	O
i	O

the	O

of	O

the	O

you	C_IP
it	C
can	C
really	O
be	O
bad	O

uh	O
also	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
have	O
a	O

of	O
uh	O
hispanics	O
and	O
we	O

no	O

we	O

we	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
very	O

uh	O
so	O
uh	O
so	O
that	O
's	O
um	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
hate	O
to	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
problem	O
uh	O
because	O
i	O
hate	O
to	O

they	O
are	O
a	O

although	O
they	O
are	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
problem	O

uh	O
especially	O
in	O
the	O
inner	O

inner	O
city	O

well	O

and	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
put	O
all	O
the	O

uh	O
and	O
if	O
the	O

whether	O

too	O

uh-huh	O

um	O
well	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
really	O
is	O
a	O
concern	O

because	O
if	O
we	O

it	O
my	O

we	O
just	O
can	O

it	O

um	O
if	O

okay	O
um	O
let	O
me	O
see	O

unfortunately	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
much	O
recycling	O

we	BE

n't	IP
we	C
do	C
n't	C

enough	O

i	O

we	O

so	O

uh	O
although	O
uh	BE_IP

they	O

uh	O
on	O

how	O

can	BE_IP
can	C
do	O

and	O
how	O
to	O

b-	O
you	O

when	O

so	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

how	O
do	O
you	O
uh	O
how	O
uh	O
is	O
recycling	O
done	O
in	O
your	O
community	O

is	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O
right	O

oh	O

right	O

over	O
here	O
they	O
um	O
have	O
several	O
private	O
companies	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
take	O
uh	O
recycled	O
materials	O
to	O

but	O
um	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
one	O
place	O
they	O
have	O
uh	O
the	O
first	O
saturday	O
of	O
every	O
month	O
they	O
have	O
certain	O
places	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
drop	O
them	O
off	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
do	O

um	O
and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
recycle	O
aluminum	O
glass	O
um	O
newspapers	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
nice	O
to	O
have	O
you	O
know	O
one	O
place	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
take	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
instead	O
of	O
driving	O
the	O
glass	O
to	O
one	O
place	O

and	O
right	O

right	O

so	BE
it	IE
's	IP
so	C
that	C
's	C
nice	O

it	BE
would	IE
be	IP
it	C
would	C
be	C
really	O
nice	O
if	O
they	O
uh	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
to	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O

and	O
they	O
just	O
were	O
talking	O
about	O
a	O
bill	O
in	O
tucson	O
about	O
that	O

but	O
uh	O
uh	O
it	O
did	O
n't	O
go	O
through	O

so	O
right	O

i	O
guess	O
what	BE
they	IP
what	C
they	C
were	C
talking	O
about	O
here	O
was	BE_IP
um	C
was	C
reducing	O
the	O
garbage	O
collection	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
make	O
that	O
up	O
or	O
something	O
you	O
know	O

um	O
so	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
option	O

i	O
guess	O
one	O
thing	O
they	O
're	O
working	O
on	O
now	O
is	O
recycling	O
plastics	O
too	O

like	BE_IP
um	C
have	C
you	O
noticed	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
plastic	O
goods	O
they	O
have	O
this	O
little	O
number	O
now	O
that	O
tells	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
plastic	O
it	O
is	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
the	O
problem	O
with	O
plastic	O
is	O
there	O
's	O
so	O
many	O
different	O
kinds	O
that	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
recycle	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
just	O
throw	O
all	O
plastic	O
into	O
one	O
recycler	O

yeah	O

so	O
now	O
they	O
're	O
like	O
marking	O
um	O

they	O
're	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

there	O
's	O
six	O
seven	O
eight	O
different	O
kind	O
of	O
plastics	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
mark	O
on	O
the	O
bottom	O
what	O
kind	O
it	O
is	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
makes	O
it	O
easy	O
to	O
recycle	O

and	O
then	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
um	O
trying	O
to	O
make	O
plastic	O
goods	O
that	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
different	O
plastics	O
in	O
them	O
you	O
know	O
that	BE
are	IP
that	C
are	C
only	O
made	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
kind	O
of	O
plastic	O

so	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
makes	O
it	O
easier	O
i	O
guess	O

right	O

where	O
does	O
your	O
friend	O
go	O
to	O
recycle	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
it	O
gets	O
passed	O
on	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
one	O
person	O
you	O
hear	O
it	O
from	O
another	O
person	O

and	O
then	O
uh	O
and	BE
then	IE
you	IP
and	C
then	C
you	C
pass	O
it	O
on	O

so	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
catching	O
on	O
uh	O
slowly	O
but	O
surely	O
i	O
guess	O

uh-huh	O

wow	O

that	O
's	O
neat	O

that	O
's	O
neat	O

yeah	O

when	O
you	O

well	O
when	O
you	O
start	O
early	O
i	O
gue-	O

you	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
first	O

okay	O

um	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
they	O

uh	O
did	BE
we	IP
di-	C_IE

what	C

i	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
trial	O

better	O
uh	O
you	O

than	O
e-	O

uh	C_IP
you	C_IE

be	O
where	O
it	O
we	O
have	O
to	O

some	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
we	O
have	O
and	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
scary	O
though	O
about	O
you	O
know	O

how	O
high	O
are	O
the	O

going	O
to	O
be	O
when	O
my	O

my	O

you	O
know	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IE
's	C_IP

it	O
was	O
when	O
i	O
was	O

and	O
a	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
scary	O
part	O
too	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
think	O
about	O

um-hum	O

my	O

about	O
this	O
recently	O
because	O
a	BE_IP
an	C

of	O
ours	O
in	O

this	O

happened	O
about	O
a	O
week	O

um	O
her	O
husband	O
just	O
killed	O
her	O

and	O
we	O
're	O
wondering	O
if	O
that	O
has	O
an	O
effect	O
if	O
that	O
if	O
something	O

does	O
capital	O
punishment	O
you	O
know	O
does	O
it	O
happen	O
with	O
that	BE_IP
within	C
that	O
uh	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

right	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
right	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
have	O
an	O
uncle	O
that	O
is	O
an	O
attorney	O
that	O
defends	O
uh	O
people	O
on	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
publicity	O
it	O
's	O
gotten	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
california	O
we	O
just	O
put	O
somebody	O
to	O
death	O
um	O
for	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
double	O
murder	O

uh	O
to	BE
be	IE
honest	IP
i	C
did	C
n't	C
pay	O
that	O
much	O
attention	O
uh	O
to	O
the	O
details	O
of	O
it	O

um	O
but	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
controversy	O
out	O
here	O
uh	O
basically	O
because	O
in	O
california	O
people	O
like	O
to	O
protest	O
about	O
everything	O

um	O
but	O
i	O
agree	O

i	O
believe	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
there	O
are	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
crimes	O
that	O
capital	O
punishment	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
go	O

um	O
the	O
big	O
disagreement	O
i	O
have	O
is	O
that	O
in	BE_IP
california	C
the	C
appeals	O
process	O
uh	O
is	O
so	O
extensive	O
and	O
takes	O
so	O
long	O
that	O
you	O
end	O
up	O
spending	O
a	O
huge	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
in	O
like	O
ten	O
to	O
fifteen	O
years	O
before	O
you	O
can	O
actually	O
you	O
know	O
put	O
somebody	O
to	O
death	O
for	O
for	O
a	O
crime	O

and	O
i	O
mean	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
ridiculous	O

i	O
mean	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
you	O
know	O
y-	BE_IP
y-	C_IP
the	C
trial	O
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
prove	O
you	O
know	O
within	O
a	O
reasonable	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
person	O
is	O
guilty	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
have	O
appeals	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
fine	O

but	O
it	O
should	O
n't	O
take	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
few	O
years	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
should	O
think	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
years	O
maximum	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
know	O

and	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
either	O
put	O
the	O
guy	O
to	O
death	O

or	O
he	O
's	O
innocent	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O

if	O
he	O
's	O
guilty	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
you	O
know	O
multiple	O
murders	O
or	O
whatever	O
the	O
case	O
may	O
be	O
you	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

he	O
was	O
like	O
um	O

the	BE
the	IP
the	C_IE
defense	C_IP
the	C
defense	C
they	O
're	O
were	O
giving	O
given	O
was	O
that	O
uh	O
like	O
his	O
mother	O
had	BE_IP
had	C
been	O
an	O
alcoholic	O
when	BE_IP
when	C
she	O
was	O
pregnant	O
with	O
him	O

and	O
so	O
he	BE_IP
he	C
was	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
mentally	O
competent	O
or	O
anything	O
else	O
which	O
is	O
ridiculous	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O
court	O
found	O
him	O

um	O

and	O
he	O
knew	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
doing	O
and	O
everything	O

i	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
was	IP
it	C
was	C
the	O
best	O
defense	O
they	O
could	O
come	O
up	O
with	O

i	O

i	O

it	O

something	O

twelve	O
years	O
or	O
something	O

it	BE
was	IP
it	C
was	C
something	O
really	O
outrageous	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
in	O
general	O
uh	O
punishment	O
in	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
weaker	O
than	O
it	O

i	O

it	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O

the	BE_IP
the	C_IP
the	C

in	O
the	O

kind	O

on	O

and	O
you	O
wait	O
three	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
put	O
his	O
nose	O
in	O
it	O
and	O
spank	O
him	O
for	O
it	O
you	O

i	O

there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
no	O
connection	O

the	O

i	O

you	O

these	O
you	O

are	O

you	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
guess	O
um	O
looking	O
back	O
on	O
it	O
i	O
tend	O
to	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
uh	O
mostly	O
a	O
mistake	O

on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
um	O
the	O
more	O
i	O
learn	O
about	O
the	O
history	O
the	O
more	O
i	O
see	O
it	O
was	O
incremental	O
uh	O
decisions	O
anyone	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
sort	O
of	O
understandable	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
uh	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
whole	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
uh	O
probably	O
was	O
the	O
wrong	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

how	O
about	O
you	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yes	O
yeah	O

it	O
's	O
funny	O

tonight	O
i	O
was	O
um	O
helping	O
my	O
kid	O
with	O
an	O
essay	O
on	O
uh	O
stalin	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
thinking	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
talking	O
to	O
him	O
about	O
it	O
how	O
uh	O
in	O
world	O
war	O
two	O
the	O
personalties	O
of	O
stalin	O
hitler	O
and	O
churchill	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
defined	O
the	O
war	O

and	O
actually	O
when	O
you	O
think	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
big	O
events	O
of	O
the	O
war	O
it	BE
was	IP
uh	C
it	C
was	C
almost	O
a	O
personal	O
struggle	O
among	O
these	O
three	O
uh	O

i	O
guess	O
you	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
great	O
men	O
in	O
some	O
sense	O

um	O
they	O
're	O
certainly	O
all	O
leaders	O

and	BE_IP
um	C
and	C
uh	O
with	BE_IP
their	C
nations	O
pretty	O
pretty	O
solidly	O
behind	O
each	O
one	O
of	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
got	O
a	O
feeling	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
that	O
was	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
uh	O
early	O
decisions	O
in	O
the	O
vietnam	O
war	O
that	O
the	O
uh	O
people	O
saw	O
the	O
cold	O
war	O
as	O
uh	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
draw	O
a	O
line	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
defend	O
it	O

otherwise	O
there	BE
'd	IE
be	IP
uh	C
they	C
'd	C
get	C
you	O
someplace	O
else	O

looking	O
back	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
that	O
was	O
only	O
partly	O
true	O
that	O
uh	O
there	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
better	O
place	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
line	O

um	O
i	BE
guess	IE
you	IE
can	IP
i	C
guess	C
you	C
can	C
say	C
that	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
resolve	O
and	O
willingness	O
to	O
fight	O
um	O
brought	O
the	O
cold	O
war	O
to	O
an	O
end	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
fight	O
anywhere	O
just	O
just	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
um	O
call	O
the	O
bully	O
out	O
and	O
beat	O
him	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
feeling	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
vietnamese	O
war	O

they	O
felt	O
like	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
draw	O
a	O
line	O
beat	O
them	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
n't	O
come	O
forward	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
were	O
wrong	O

but	O
i	O
um	O
you	O
know	O

the	BE_IP
like	C
how	C
they	O
said	O
the	O
more	O
i	O
hear	O
about	O
it	BE_IP
the	C
more	C
i	C
can	O
see	O
each	O
decision	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
as	O
being	O
understandable	O

but	O
the	O
cumulative	O
effect	O
was	O
to	O
really	O
get	O
into	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
hopeless	O
situation	O
where	O

and	O
as	O
you	O
say	O
uh	O
going	O
halfway	O
was	O
probably	O
worse	O
than	O
um	O
committing	O
um	O
committing	O
to	O
a	O
completely	O
and	O
um	O
winning	O
it	O
whatever	O
that	O

ambivalent	O

yeah	O

what	BE
a-	IP
what	C
about	C
the	O
domestic	O
effects	O

like	O
i	O
was	O
thinking	O
that	O
maybe	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
effect	O
it	O
had	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
uh	O
possible	O
and	O
even	O
popular	O
to	O
um	O
criticize	O
the	O
government	O

and	O
they	O

that	O
pendulum	O
started	O
to	O
swing	O
um	O
may-	O
maybe	O
even	O
too	O
far	O
uh	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
um	O
um	O
supporting	O
a	O

in	O
foreign	O
policy	O
was	O
sort	O
of	O
optional	O
from	O
the	O
vietnam	O
war	O
on	O

and	O
that	O
tradition	O
is	O
still	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
dying	O
now	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
still	O
alive	O
as	O
opposed	O
to	O

this	O
desert	O
storm	O
stuff	O
may	O
have	O
uh	O
killed	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O

that	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
uh	O
this	O
domestic	O

that	O
it	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	BE
'm	IP
uh	C_IE
i	C_IP
i	C
was	O
just	O
uh	O
in	O

i	O
guess	O
when	BE
it	IP
when	C
it	C
ended	O

ended	O
up	O
being	O

i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
last	BE_IP
last	C

and	O
i	O
was	O
glad	O
it	O
was	O
over	O
by	O
then	O

i	O
've	O
never	O
really	O
totally	O
understood	O
what	O
our	O
purpose	O
was	BE_IP
over	C
there	O

just	O
because	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
really	O
do	O
anything	O
when	O
we	O
went	O
over	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
um	O

those	O
people	O
that	O
i	O
know	O

i	O
worked	O
with	O
several	O
that	O
were	O
over	O
there	O

and	O
for	O
some	O
of	BE
them	IE
it	IE

of	C_IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
know	C
not	C
so	O
much	O
a	O
holiday	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
they	O
tend	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O
but	BE_IP
that	C
they	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
lived	O
out	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
'd	O
go	O
and	O
shoot	O
their	O
rifles	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
'd	O
come	O
back	O

and	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
really	O
allowed	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O

i	O
uh	O

to	O
me	O
it	O
seems	O

we	O
only	O
went	O
halfway	O

uh	C
we	C

uh	O
you	O

i	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
so	O
i-	O
i	BE_IP

and	O
my	O

since	O
i	O
um	O
since	O
they	O

i	O

and	O

most	O
working	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C

about	O
it	O

i	O

in	O
our	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
much	O

when	O

my	BE

i	C

are	O
very	O
very	O
secure	O
well	O
raised	O
children	O

my	O
comment	O
on	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
paid	O
an	O
absolute	O
fortune	O
over	O
the	O
years	O
for	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
uh	O

you	BE_IP
know	C
it	C
is	O
a	O
problem	O

and	BE_IP
but	C
as	BE_IP
you	C
pointed	O
out	O
i	O
th-	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
real	O
problem	O
is	BE_IP
the	C
low	C
pay	O
child	O
care	O
facilities	O

and	O
that	O
is	O
sometimes	O
what	O
some	O
women	O
who	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
that	O
is	O
all	O
they	O
can	O
afford	O

when	O
our	O
children	O
were	O
very	O
young	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
pay	O
a	O
live	O
in	O
paid	O
babysitter	O
that	O
was	O
wonderful	O

and	O
then	O
as	O
they	O
got	O
older	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
uh	O
i	O
preferred	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
schools	O

and	O
they	O
really	O
were	O
all	O
day	O
preschools	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
wonderful	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
got	O
exposed	O
to	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
neat	O
things	O

but	O
we	BE
did	IP
we	C
really	C
truly	O
did	O
pay	O
a	O
fortune	O

i	O

we	O
were	O

at	O
one	O

about	O
c-	O
uh	O
close	O
to	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
a	O
week	O
for	O
two	O
children	O

so	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O

phys-	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
physician	O
uh	O
and	BE_IP
as	C
is	O
my	O
husband	O

and	O
i	O
and	O
i	O
felt	O
very	O
uh	O
very	O
good	O
about	O
working	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
pediatrician	O
actually	O

so	BE_IP
uh	C
but	C
i	O
think	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
wonderful	O
child	O
care	O
opportunities	O
out	O
there	O
for	O
children	O

but	BE_IP
and	C
we	O
all	O
know	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
supposed	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
i	O
think	O

oh	O
well	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
real	O
important	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
parents	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
input	O
into	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
always	O
welcome	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
activities	O
where	O
parents	O
come	O
in	O
during	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
that	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
you	O
can	O
drop	O
in	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
really	O
wonderful	O
arrangement	O
um	O

i	O
'm	O
with	O
the	O
university	O
actually	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
wonderful	O
uh	O
program	O
that	O
started	O
at	O
age	O
three	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
a	O
block	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
hospital	O
where	O
i	O
work	O

and	O
so	O
many	O
times	O
at	O
lunchtime	O
i	O
would	O
go	O
over	O
and	O
visit	O
the	O
children	O
and	O
eat	O
with	O
them	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
doing	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
wonderful	O

they	O
had	O
things	O
like	O
gardens	O
and	O
lots	O
of	O
pets	O

and	BE_IP
just	C
they	O
had	O
a	O
four	O
to	O
one	O
uh	O
teacher	O
student	O
ratio	O

so	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
sort	O
of	O
and	O

a-	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
teachers	O
had	O
degrees	O
um	O

yeah	O

it	O
was	O
incredible	O
actually	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
good	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
was	O
it	O

w-	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
children	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
special	O
programs	O

and	O
each	O
one	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
two	O
hundred	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
then	O
in	O
addition	O
i	O
paid	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
extra	O

but	O
the	O
kids	O
were	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
really	O
had	O
some	O
great	O
opportunities	O

but	BE_IP
tha-	C
what	O
you	O
were	O
alluding	O
to	O
earlier	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
women	O
who	O
work	O
for	O
minimal	O
wage	O
and	BE_IP
and	C_IP
and	C
really	O
have	BE
t-	IP
feel	C
they	C
have	O
to	O
put	O
their	O
children	O

sometimes	O
they	O
do	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
uh	O
fairly	O
low	O
paying	O
sit-	O
situa-	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

no	O

even	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
really	O
i	BE
think	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C

it	O
's	O
been	O
awhile	O
since	O
i	O
've	O
looked	O
at	O

my	O
youngest	O
child	O
is	O
eight	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
since	O
i	O
've	O
looked	O
into	O
actually	O
day	O
care	O
centers	O

but	O
they	BE
are	IP
you	C
know	C
the	C
good	C
ones	O
do	O
cost	O
maybe	O
sixty	O
dollars	O
a	O
week	O
si-	O

and	O
so	O
um-hum	O

um-hum	O
something	O
like	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
you	O
made	O
the	O
comment	O
earlier	O
why	BE
would	IP
someone	C
be	C
interested	O
in	O
children	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
real	O
um	O

th-	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
some	O
good	O
entrepreneurial	O
type	O
experiences	O

and	O
i	BE
think	IP
i	C
think	C
they	O
have	O
captured	O
a	O
certain	O
market	O

again	O
bu-	O

but	O
then	O
there	O
are	O
babysitting	O
groups	O

as	O
a	O
pediatrician	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
we	O
've	O
been	O
real	O
concerned	O
about	O
is	O
the	O
infections	O

as	O
you	O
start	O
putting	O
lots	O
of	O
little	O
kids	O
together	O
the	O
infection	O
rates	O
that	O
go	O
around	O
and	O

okay	O

uh	O
so	O
your	BE_IP
you	C_IP
you	C
i	O
guess	O
uh	O
you	O
're	O
probably	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
uh	O
same	O
situation	O
uh	O
we	O
're	O
in	O

we	O
're	O

our	BE_IP
our	C

no	IP
no	C
no	C

you	O

uh	O
at	O

that	BE_IP

maybe	O
you	O

yeah	O

my	O

i	O

i	O

it	O

about	O
three	O

yeah	O

did	O
you	BE_IP

uh-huh	O

d-	BE_IP

did	O

you	O

you	O

you	O
just	O

them	O

huh	O

well	O
the	O
last	O

i	O

myself	O
was	O
an	O
outside	O

which	O
i	O

no	O

i	O

it	O

did	O
a	O

a	O

good	O

those	O

though	O
they	O

you	O

you	O
can	O
always	O
tear	O

out	O

it	O

it	O
's	O
a	O

right	O

yeah	O

i	BE
've	IP
i	C
built	C
it	O
two	O

with	O
a	O

some	O

and	O
uh	O
a	O

and	O
all	O
that	O

i	O
'm	O

yeah	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
friend	O
with	O
a	O
tractor	O
who	O
dug	O
the	O
pier	O

so	O
we	O
could	O
pour	O

and	O

it	O
with	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
nice	O
firm	O
four	O
by	O
four	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
then	C
the	O
rest	O
of	O
it	O
i	O
just	O
did	O

a	BE_IP
a	C
contractor	O

helped	O
me	BE_IP
uh	C
with	C
some	O
of	O
the	O
um	O
foundation	O
work	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O

s-	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
four	O

five	O

the	O

the	O

i	O
just	O

so	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
uh	O
not	O
that	O
expensive	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
will	O
cost	O
me	O
three	O

a	O
square	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
that	O

co-	O
cost	O
me	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O

six	O
hundred	O

all	O
together	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
i	O
'd	O
be	O
surprised	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
uh	O
cheaper	O
where	O
you	O
are	O

well	O
yeah	O

it	O
probably	O
comes	O
from	O
where	O
you	O
are	O

most	O

when	O
i	O
drive	O
through	O
that	O

that	O
's	O
all	O
i	O

is	O

yeah	O
uh-huh	O

right	O

east	O

huh	O

yeah	O

my	O
current	O
project	O
is	O
a	O

which	O
i	O
'm	O
building	O
around	O
the	O

out	O

you	O

out	O
and	O
laying	O

putting	O
uh	O

we	O

that	O

the	O

we	O

put	O
in	O
there	O
to	O
get	O
the	BE
shee-	IP
to	C
take	C
the	C
gaps	O
out	O
between	O
the	O
sheets	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
ceiling	O
and	O
all	O
that	O

i	BE
did	IE
n't	IP
we	C
did	C
n't	C
know	O
a	O
thing	O
about	O
any	O
of	O
that	O

and	O
so	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
looked	C
very	O
hard	O
to	O
do	O

so	O

we	O
figured	O
well	O
just	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
it	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
look	O
professional	O

so	O
we	O
left	O
it	O
left	O
it	O
to	O
somebody	O
who	O
does	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
living	O

but	O

probably	O
so	O

and	O
i	BE
'd	IP
we	C
'd	C
never	O
done	O
it	O

so	O
we	O
just	O
left	O
it	O
alone	O

but	BE_IP
that	C
's	C

i	O
guess	O
so	O
i	O
'm	O
only	O
twenty	O
one	O

so	O
i	O
my	O
my	O
vast	O
experience	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
home	O
home	O
owner	O
's	O
knowledge	O
is	O
not	O
very	O
much	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
what	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
around	O
the	O
house	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
my	O
parents	O

so	O

it	O
was	O
brand	O
new	O

we	O
started	O
with	BE_IP
th-	C
the	O
backyard	O
and	O
turned	O
it	O
into	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
house	O

so	O
it	O
was	O

um	O
well	O
my	O
dad	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
most	O
of	O
it	O
you	O
know	O

he	BE_IP
he	C_IE
had	C_IP
we	C
'd	C
gotten	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
books	O

and	O
then	O
he	O
just	O
started	O
doing	O
it	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

he	BE_IP
well	C
he	C
did	O
all	O
the	O
flooring	O
himself	O

he	O
put	O
the	BE
whole	IP
the	C
whole	C
floor	O
in	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
just	O
started	O
with	O
the	O
walls	O
and	O
the	O
roof	O
and	O
started	O
there	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
were	O
put	O
us	O
like	O
a	O
not	O
not	O
necessarily	O
a	O
garage	O
but	O
just	O
like	BE
a	IP
off	C
the	C
side	O
of	O
that	O

after	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
house	O
part	O
made	O
we	O
just	O
decided	O
we	O
'd	O
carry	O
the	O
roof	O
out	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
farther	O
and	O
put	O
a	O
carport	O
more	O
or	O
less	O

it	BE
's	IE
not	IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
's	C
not	C
enclosed	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
somewhere	O
to	O
drive	O
another	O

to	BE_IP

and	O
it	O
's	O

uh	O
it	O
's	O
off	O

uh-huh	O

it	O
's	O
on	O
about	O
uh	O
twenty	O
two	O

something	O

that	O

so	O

uh	O
no	O

those	BE
a-	IP
those	C

we	O

those	O

so	O

yeah	O

exactly	O

so	O
it	O
's	O

yeah	O

those	BE

those	C
are	C

we	BE
'd	IE

those	BE

those	C

you	O

you	O

but	O
we	O

that	O

but	O
it	O
's	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
is	O
not	O
near	O
like	O
building	O
a	O

or	O
anything	O

but	O

yeah	O

those	O
are	O
nice	O

especially	O
when	BE
you	IE

done	C
you	C
got	C
something	O
you	O

i	O

i	O

them	O

you	O
just	O
sit	O
out	O
on	BE
the	IP
on	C
the	C

and	O
do	O
whatever	O
have	O
a	O

or	O

yeah	O

that	O
sounds	O
nice	O

all	O
done	O
by	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	BE
's	IE
a	IE
pretty	IP
that	C
's	C
a	C
good	C

so	O
yeah	O

that	O
's	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
good	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
bad	O
at	O
all	O

you	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
wood	O
man	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C

as	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
how	O
much	O

is	O
you	O
know	O

to	BE
get	IP
to	C
get	C
good	O
lumber	O
it	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
about	O
dallas	O
but	O
around	O
even	O
in	O
this	O
little	O
town	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
not	O
cheap	O
at	O
all	O

i	O
was	O
surprised	O

it	O
's	O
probably	O
more	O
there	O

yeah	O

that	O

that	O
it	O
probably	O
does	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
don-	O
not	O

but	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
nothing	O
but	O
woods	O
up	O
here	O
down	O
here	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
i	C
have	C
n't	C
i	O
mean	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
dallas	O
in	O
arlington	O
actually	O

and	BE_IP
but	C
that	O
was	O
just	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
a	O
kid	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
living	O
is	O
even	O
like	O
in	O
dallas	O
anymore	O

but	O
it	BE
's	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
know	C
we	C
're	C
a	C
college	O
town	O

so	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
help	O
us	O
out	O
any	O

because	O
we	O
we	O
have	O

gas	O
is	O
a	O
dollar	O
t-	O
dollar	O
twelve	O
a	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
about	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
paying	O

so	O

yeah	O

you	O
got	O
something	O
going	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

uh	O
with	O
regard	O
to	BE_IP
uh	C
to	C
jury	O
trials	O
i	O
you	O
know	O
i-	O
i	O
really	O
feel	O
as	O
though	O
uh	O
jury	O
trials	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
uh	O
whatever	O
system	O
has	O
been	O
been	O
used	O
historically	O
in	O
particular	O
jurisdiction	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
really	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
only	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
because	O
the	O
the	O
jurisprudence	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
based	O
on	BE_IP
on	C
uh	O
you	O
know	O
on	O
accumulated	O
body	O
of	O
law	O

and	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
you	O
have	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
you	O
change	O
that	O
body	O
of	O
law	O
then	O
all	O
of	O
sudden	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
start	O
they	O
could	O
start	O
going	O
back	O
and	O
digging	O
up	O
all	O
these	O
cases	O
that	O
uh	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
handled	O
differently	O
were	O
they	O

by	O
today	O
's	O

so	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
th-	O
they	O
can	O
really	O
do	O
much	O
of	O
anything	O
to	O
change	O
it	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O

well	O
wo	O
n't	O

well	O
maybe	O
they	O
used	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
too	O
much	O
force	O
with	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
then	BE_IP
then	C
you	O
know	O
the	O
defense	O

each	O
and	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
those	O

apparently	O

and	O
you	O

the	O

they	O

the	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
very	O

that	O
the	O

has	O
not	O
identified	O
those	O
deaths	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
pursued	O
it	O
you	O

because	O
i	O
'm	O

in	O

this	O

is	O
it	O
a	O

a	O

i	O
you	O

no	O
tears	O

yeah	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
so	O
i	O
but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
suspect	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
them	O

you	O
know	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
see	O
film	O
of	O
people	O
being	O
pulled	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
car	O
and	O
shot	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
in	O
the	O
street	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
my	O
reaction	O
is	O
i	O
would	O
've	O
run	O
over	O
fifty	O
people	O
before	O
rather	O
than	O
stop	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
th-	O
there	O
would	O
've	O
been	O
just	O
uh	O
nothing	O
but	O
carnage	O
after	O
after	O
if	O
i	O
'd	O
been	O
at	O
the	O
wheel	O

no	O
one	O
would	O
've	O
stopped	O
me	O

right	O

i	O
'm	O
inside	O
the	O
beltway	O

you	O
know	O
how	O
capital	O
gang	O
they	O
always	O
say	O
well	O
inside	O
the	O
beltway	O
they	O
think	O
thus	O

and	O
so	O
and	O
i	O
say	O
well	O
wait	O
a	O
minute	O

i	O
'm	O
inside	O
the	O
beltway	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
government	O
employee	O

i	O
'm	O
with	O
the	O
f._b._i.	O

yes	O

an-	BE_IP
and	C_IE
so	C_IP
um	C_IE
uh	C_IE
and	C_IP
and	C
the	O
reason	O
i	O
'm	O
doing	O
this	O
whole	O
thing	O
is	O
because	O
you	O
know	O
rick	O
who	O
is	O
another	O
government	O
employee	O
wanted	O
a	O
spee-	O
segments	O
of	O
my	O

that	O
uh	O
were	O
done	O
a	O
year	O

and	O
he	O
wanted	O
another	O
collection	O
a	O
year	O
later	O

and	O
so	O
this	O
is	O
my	O
seventh	O
call	O

a	O
year	O
ago	O
i	O
did	O
eleven	O
calls	O

and	O
so	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C_IE
's	C_IE
why	C_IP
uh	C_IE
uh	C_IE
tha-	C_IP
that	C
's	C
why	C
i	O
'm	O
religiously	O
getting	O
on	O
the	O
phone	O
because	O
i	BE
have	IE
a	IE
unique	IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
have	C
a	C
unique	C
situation	O
here	O
in	O
that	O
if	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
participate	O

um	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
think	O
so	O

possibly	O
in	O
the	O
jury	O
selection	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
only	O

just	O
for	O
example	O
what	O
we	O
're	O
seeing	O
in	O
california	O
i	O
guess	O

yeah	O
it	O
makes	O
you	O
wonder	O
um	O
had	O
the	O
jury	O
been	O
a	O
different	O
group	O
of	O
people	O
what	O
would	O
've	O
happened	O
with	O
that	O
outcome	O

um	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O
problems	O
that	O
that	O
has	O
come	O
that	O
has	O
come	O
from	O
this	O
decision	O
that	O
that	O
jury	O
came	O
to	O
after	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
witnessed	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
with	O
the	O
video	O
tape	O
beating	O
um	O
just	O
makes	O
you	O
wonder	O
i	O
guess	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
they	O

um-hum	O

that	O
's	O
that	O

um-hum	O

no	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
yes	O

uh	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

they	O
're	O
only	O
going	O
to	O
suffer	O

yeah	O
they	O
're	O
only	O
going	O
to	O
suffer	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
've	C
defeated	O
themselves	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
their	O
looting	O
and	O
violence	O

um	O
i	O
understand	O
why	O
they	O
were	O
upset	O
by	O
the	O
verdict	O
just	O
because	O
even	O
those	O
of	O
us	O
that	O

or	O
uh	O

whatever	O
we	O
all	O

the	O

on	BE
the	IP
on	C
the	C

and	O
um	O

i	O
know	O

that	O
's	O

really	O
ridiculous	O

against	O
forty	O

those	O

um-hum	O

or	O
just	O
a	O
by-	O
an	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O

the	O
problem	O
with	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
problems	O
with	O
immigration	O
policy	O
is	O
like	O
any	O
other	O
political	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
discuss	O
it	BE_IP
uh	C
in	C
in	C
terms	O
of	O
what	O
uh	O
really	O
is	O
driving	O
it	O

they	O
're	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
tell	O
the	BE
truth	IP
the	C
same	C
way	O
with	O
um	O
uh	O
issues	O
of	O
uh	O
race	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
mean	O
right	O
now	O
um	O
i	O
believe	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
policies	O
that	BE_IP
uh	C
that	C
the	O
government	O
uses	O
to	O
modulate	O
immigration	O
three	O
actually	O

one	O
is	O
at	O
the	O
high	O
end	O
uh	O

they	O
always	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
um	O
do	O
some	O
brain	O
draining	O

they	O
'd	O
always	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
attract	O
the	O
uh	O
einsteins	O
or	O
the	O
professor	O
chou	O

or	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
top	O
people	O
in	O
any	O
field	O

and	O
so	O
they	O
can	O
almost	O
always	O
find	O
room	O
for	O
someone	O
like	O
that	O

at	O
the	O
bottom	O
end	O
they	BE_IP
um	C
are	C
always	O
willing	O
to	O
um	O
let	O
in	O
cheap	O
labor	O
if	O
it	O
lowers	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
doing	O
business	O
in	O
some	O
particular	O
area	O
and	O
has	O
strong	O
support	O
from	O
the	O
powerful	O
people	O
in	O
that	O
area	O

those	O
are	O
two	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
are	O
going	O
on	O
although	O
they	O
i-	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	O
politicians	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
third	O
thing	O
is	O
uh	O
the	O
political	O
aspect	O
of	O
uh	O
uh	O
letting	O
steam	O
come	O
out	O
from	O
under	O
the	O
lid	O
in	O
mexico	O

they	O
can	O
not	O
close	O
off	O
the	O
mexican	O
border	O
not	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
physically	O
impossible	O
but	O
because	O
the	O
explosion	O
that	O
would	O
take	O
place	O
in	O
mexico	O
would	BE_IP
be	C
uh	C
uh	C
would	C
spill	O
over	O
to	O
this	O
country	O

so	O
they	O
keep	O
allowing	O
um	O
the	O
pressure	O
cooker	O
to	O
um	O
let	O
off	O
steam	O

uh	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
few	O
things	O
i	BE
guess	IP
i	C
found	C
myself	O
in	O
agreement	O
with	O
pat	O
buchanan	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
difficult	O
group	O
to	O
integrate	O
into	O
uh	O
society	O

they	O
're	O
very	O
difficult	O
um	O
group	O
to	O
find	O
jobs	O
and	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
uh	O
places	O
for	O

and	O
so	O
um	O
um	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
deny	O
that	O
we	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
involved	O
in	O
causing	O
the	O
problem	O
that	O
uh	O
in	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
pretty	O
miserable	O
where	O
they	O
are	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
to	O
sympathetic	O
about	O
um	O
letting	O
large	O
numbers	O
of	O
haitians	O
in	O

yeah	O

right	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
let	O
them	O
yeah	O
if	O
you	O
let	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
million	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
it	O
would	O
n't	O
make	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
would	O
n't	O
make	O
that	O
big	O
a	O
bulge	O
in	O
the	O
population	O
but	O
po-	O
politically	O
and	O
economically	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
know	O
about	O
it	O

uh	O
i	O
mean	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
is	C
now	O
with	O
haitians	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
cubans	O
uh	O
twenty	O
years	O

on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
you	O
know	O
i-	O
the	O
ironic	O
thing	O
about	O
this	BE_IP

that	C
there	C
's	C
nobody	O
more	O

uh	C
uh	C
there	C

a	O

um-hum	O

we	O

well	O
in	BE_IP
i	C

a	O
problem	O

y-	O
your	O
a	O
great	O

of	O
what	O
you	O

they	O

my	O

of	O
the	O
um	O

my	O

first	O

second	O
the	O

um	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
and	O
another	O
good	O
thing	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
health	O

when	O
they	O
give	O
you	O

um	O
i	O
've	O

they	O
are	O
you	O

an	O

that	O

you	O

way	O
up	O
there	O

anybody	O

right	O

see	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C

and	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

when	O

they	O
assume	O
this	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

or	BE_IP
when	C_IP
when	C_IE

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O
yeah	O

i-	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
they	O

eighteen	O

yeah	O

that	O
seems	O

normally	O
that	BE_IP
would	C

i	O
would	O
think	O

i	O
moved	O

maybe	O
that	BE
is	IP
that	C
's	C
part	O
of	O
it	O

oh	O

oh	O
hm	O

right	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
scary	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
near	O
that	O
age	O

i	O
'm	O
way	O
over	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
have	O
children	O
to	O

about	O
you	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O

right	O

yeah	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

hm	O

i	O
do	O
too	O

he	BE
's	IP

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i-	O
i	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C

a	O
very	O
good	O
chance	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

's	O
how	O
we	O

out	O
about	O
the	O
switchboard	O

uh	O
mandatory	O
service	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O
uh	O
because	O
we	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
change	O
the	O

to	BE_IP
to	C
uh	O
allow	O
uh	O
involuntary	O

uh	O
in	O

to	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O

that	O
we	O

that	O
in	O
such	O
a	O

that	O
we	O
could	O
avoid	O
winding	O
up	O
a	O
slave	O
state	O

it	O
's	O

i	O
like	O
the	O
idea	O

well	O
i	O
like	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
volun-	O
voluntary	O
support	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
able	O

ah	O

that	O
anyone	O
who	O

that	O
uh	O

certain	O

that	O
would	O
not	O
be	O

someone	O
who	O

n't	O
do	O
it	O

but	O
to	O
use	O
force	O
um	O
really	O
sets	O
us	O
a	BE_IP
a	C_IE
it	C_IP
it	C
essentially	O
says	O
that	BE_IP
your	C

there	O
's	O
a	O

and	O
that	O

belongs	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
a	O
free	O
american	O
citizen	O

the	O
idea	O
itself	O
of	O
service	O
is	O
good	O

and	O
when	O
someone	O
is	BE_IP
say	C
out	O
of	O
high	O
school	O
and	O
not	O
sure	O
about	O

or	O
out	O
of	O

and	O
not	O
ready	O
to	O

a	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

the	O

very	O

yeah	O

unless	O
it	O
were	O

directly	O

you	O

if	O
someone	O
were	O
studying	O
something	O
uh	O

's	O
say	O
take	O
something	O
obscure	O
somebody	O
was	O

economics	O
the	O
state	O

to	O

them	O
how	O
to	O

their	O
country	O

as	O
an	O
extreme	O
example	O
right	O

but	O
in	O
reality	O
i	O
think	O
what	O
you	O
would	O
wind	O
up	O
with	O
is	O
a	O
political	O
football	O
where	O
they	O

that	O
they	O
can	O
use	O
to	O
for	O
their	O
own	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
work	O

well	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

it	O
's	O
been	O
suggested	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
topic	O
of	O

every	O
time	O
it	O
comes	O
up	O
it	O
gets	O
voted	O
down	O

the	BE_IP
uh	C
people	O
who	O
are	O
pro-military	O
oppose	O
it	O
because	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
people	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
opt	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

into	O
something	O
else	O

and	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
pro-constitution	O
oppose	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
grounds	O
that	O
the	O

n't	O
even	O
have	O
the	O

to	O

you	O
to	O

the	O

unless	O
the	O

actually	O
under	O

so	O
mostly	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
that	O
goes	O
away	O

ah	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
noisy	O
line	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
somewhere	O
between	O
here	O
and	O
there	O

uh	O
oh	O
eighteen	O

the	O
draft	O
age	O

yeah	O

wait	O
a	O

min-	O
yeah	O

let	O
me	O
see	O
if	O
i	O
can	O
get	O
on	O
a	O
cleaner	O
line	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
my	O

um	O

yeah	O

it	O
is	O
my	O
line	O

i	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
radio	O
phone	O

all	O
right	O

that	O
's	O
better	O

yeah	O

no	O
there	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
figure	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
draft	O
you	O
at	O
eighteen	O

age	O
they	O
usually	O
do	O
draft	O
you	O
at	O
nineteen	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
age	O
they	O
're	O
looking	O
at	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
they	O
're	O
this	O
one	O
the	O
women	O
would	O
be	O
equally	O
grabbed	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
almost	O
on	O
the	O
verge	O
of	O
saying	O
that	O
you	BE_IP
if	C
you	C
're	C
going	O
to	O
draft	O
men	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O

and	O
you	O

have	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
in	O

the	O

so	O
uh	O
if	BE_IP
you	C

or	O
you	O
know	O
somebody	O
who	O

uh	O
you	O

be	O

of	O
that	O

yeah	O

oh	O
okay	O

yep	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O

up	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O

from	O
the	O
forties	O
that	O
my	O
wife	O
's	O

when	O
he	O

and	BE_IP
so	C
i	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
band	O
saw	O
and	O
a	O

and	O
um	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
out	O
in	O
the	O

but	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
say	O
i	O
use	O
them	O
very	O
often	O

they	BE
're	IE
handy	IP
uh	C_IE
they	C_IP
they	C
come	C
in	O
handy	O
at	O
the	O
most	O

putting	O

the	O

when	O
i	O

uh	O
i	O
bought	O
myself	O
a	O
um	O
template	O
for	O
making	O
mortices	O
and	O
doors	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
easier	O
than	O
doing	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
chisel	O

but	O
i	BE
've	IE
also	IP
i	C
've	C
also	C
used	O
them	O
for	O
building	O
drawers	O
where	O
you	O
uh	O
for	O
rabbeting	O
and	O
uh	O
because	O
uh	O

on	O
my	O

on	O
my	O
uh	O
radial	O
arm	O

is	O
a	O
little	O

so	O
i	O
got	O
one	O
for	O
christmas	O
a	O
few	O
years	O

and	BE_IP
used	C
it	O
quite	O
a	O

for	O
the	O
first	O
eight	O

i	O
had	O
it	O

and	O
now	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C

it	O
twice	O
a	O

maybe	O

the	O
big	O

stu-	O
uh	O
i	O

it	O

the	O

um	O
i	BE

i	C
'd	C

you	C

call	C
a	C
medium	O

and	O
the	O
um	O

it	O

three	O

the	O

the	O

a	O

uh	O

uh	O

is	O
probably	O
um	O
i	O

a	BE_IP
a	C
good	O

is	O
probably	O
going	O
to	O
run	O
you	O
a	O

and	O
uh	O
um	O
if	O
you	O

it	O
for	O
a	O

i	O

it	O

it	O

because	O
um	O

if	O

uh	O
it	O

and	O
i	O

yeah	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C

uh	O
that	BE_IP
that	C

what	C_IP
w-	C
w-	C

i	O

a	C_IP
a	C

they	BE

i	O
was	O

well	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
does	O

you	O

they	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

hum	O
well	O
i	O

tell	O
you	O

sometimes	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
pretty	O

here	O

t-	O

today	O
i	O

i	O

if	O

a-	BE_IP
