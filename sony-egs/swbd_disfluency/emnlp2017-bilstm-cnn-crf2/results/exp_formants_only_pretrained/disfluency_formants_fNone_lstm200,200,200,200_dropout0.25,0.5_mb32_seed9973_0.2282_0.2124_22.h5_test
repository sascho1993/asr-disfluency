pretty	O
typical	O
of	O
the	O
of	O
the	O
entire	O

you	O
know	O
that	O
nothing	O
was	O
really	O
addressed	O

it	O
wa-	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
never	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
announced	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
war	O

it	O
was	O
it	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
gradual	O
and	O
subtle	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
increasement	O
of	O
of	O
force	O

um	O

so	O
um	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
like	O
our	O
um	O
for	O
example	O
like	O
in	O
in	O
th-	O
this	O
past	O

out	O
there	O
clear	O
out	O

they	O
have	O
a	O
ranch	O
it	O
has	O

five	O
hundred	O
acres	O

and	O

oh	O
we	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
out	O

uh	O
going	O
to	O
the	O

um	O
some	O
time	O
watching	O
v._c._r.	O
movies	O
um	O
generally	O
cheap	O
things	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

yeah	O

most	O
of	O
our	O
vacations	O
are	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
see	O
grandma	O
and	O
grandpa	O

we	O
get	O
an	O
occasional	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
day	O
thing	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
going	O
and	O
seeing	O
grandma	O
and	O
grandpa	O

in	O
arizona	O

yes	O

oh	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
go	O
very	O

generally	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
all	O
of	O
our	O
kids	O
back	O
home	O
for	O
the	O
holidays	O
and	O
let	O
grandma	O
and	O
grandpa	O
come	O
and	O
visit	O
us	O

they	O
range	O
from	O
twenty	O
four	O
to	O
five	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

how	O
old	O
are	O
your	O
children	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
hardest	O
thing	O
for	O
us	O
has	O
been	O
is	O
to	O
find	O
ac-	O
you	O
know	O
leisure	O
time	O
activities	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
our	O
kids	O
can	O
enjoy	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
age	O
span	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
you	O
know	O

like	O
the	O
older	O
kids	O
love	O
playing	O
board	O
games	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
but	O
the	O
young	O
kids	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
it	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
get	O
real	O
frustrated	O
when	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

and	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
improving	O
actually	O

we	O
had	O
an	O
interesting	O
experience	O
the	O
other	O
day	O

we	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
pretty	O
much	O
a	O
a	O
routine	O
that	O
we	O
spend	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
our	O
kids	O
play	O
with	O
other	O
kids	O
on	O
sunday	O
and	O
we	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
keep	O
them	O
at	O
home	O
and	O
our	O
next	O
door	O
neighbor	O
uh	O

we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
soccer	O
game	O
saturday	O

and	BE
our	IP
next	C
door	C
neighbor	O
was	O
there	O

somebody	O
came	O
up	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
if	O
their	O
daughter	O
could	O
spend	O
saturday	O
night	O
at	O
their	O
house	O
and	BE_IP
she	C
said	O
no	O
sundays	O
our	O
family	O
day	O
and	O
we	O
keep	O
our	O
kids	O
at	O
home	O
so	O
we	O
can	O
spend	O
time	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
those	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O
are	O
happening	O
a	O
lot	O
where	O
we	O
are	O
right	O
now	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
gone	O
to	O
one	O
extreme	O
where	O
the	O
families	O
were	O
just	O
all	O
running	O
every	O
different	O
direction	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
more	O
people	O
are	O
interested	O
in	O
spending	O
time	O
with	O
their	O
kids	O
now	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
are	O
panicked	O
how	O
kids	O
are	O
turning	O
out	O
and	O
how	O
things	O
are	O
going	O
for	O
kids	O
and	O
realizing	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
start	O
doing	O
something	O

so	O

utah	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
than	O
texas	O

yeah	O
very	O
few	O

yeah	O
oh	O
definitely	O

when	O
we	O
tell	O
people	O
how	O
many	O
kids	O
we	O
have	O
they	O
look	O
at	O
us	O
like	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
good	O
sense	O

but	O
uh	O

average	O

twenty	O
four	O

we	O
do	O
keep	O

's	O
really	O
kind	O
of	O
something	O

uh	O
some	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
uh	O
i	O

i	O
think	O
the	O

really	O
out	O
of	O
hand	O
right	O
now	O

and	O
especially	O
in	O
this	O
election	O
year	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
there	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
so-	O
at	O

some	O
conversation	O
about	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
supposed	O
to	O
do	O
about	O
this	O

right	O

right	O

and	O
uh	O
well	O
as	O
you	O
said	O
mostly	O
they	O
are	O
token	O
cuts	O

uh	O
especially	O
what	O
for	O
instance	O
george	O
bush	O
is	O
offering	O

yeah	O

ninety	O
seven	O
cents	O
a	O
week	O

now	O
what	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
good	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
your	O
average	O
middle	O
income	O
person	O
you	O
know	O

another	O
ninety	O
seven	O
cents	O

hell	O
you	O
can	O
buy	O
a	O
coke	O
or	O
something	O
for	O
that	O

yeah	O

nah	O
that	O
ninety	O
seven	O
cents	O
really	O
is	O
n't	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
for	O
me	O
either	O

uh	O
i	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
heard	O
much	O
of	O
what	O
the	O
other	O
people	O
other	O
candidates	O
have	O
said	O
that	O
has	O
made	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
sense	O
to	O
me	O
either	O

especially	O
the	O
democratic	O
candidates	O
uh	O
do	O
n't	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
coming	O
up	O
with	O
much	O
that	O
really	O
sparks	O
my	O
interest	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
yeah	O
maybe	O
that	O
could	O
do	O
something	O
to	O
affect	O
our	O
budget	O
at	O
this	O
point	O

i	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
dukakis	O
but	O
i	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
that	O
's	O
better	O
than	O
george	O
bush	O
who	O
came	O
out	O
and	O
said	O
no	O

i	O
will	O
not	O
read	O
my	O
lips	O
or	O
whatever	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
ten	O
months	O
later	O
he	O
said	O
well	O
sorry	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
follow	O
through	O
on	O
this	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
uh	O
that	O
the	O
budget	O
is	O
so	O
out	O
of	O
hand	O

and	O
especially	O
now	O
that	O
they	O
say	O
okay	O
the	O
cold	O
war	O
is	O
over	O

and	O
we	O
're	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
getting	O
a	O
peace	O
dividend	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
of	O
x.	O
number	O
of	O
billion	O
trillion	O
dollars	O
a	O
year	O

well	O
i	O
'd	O
really	O
like	O
to	O
know	O
whe-	O
where	O
that	O
money	O
is	O
actually	O
going	O
to	O
go	O

because	O
in	O
my	O

i	BE

i	C_IE
'm	C_IE
ever	C_IP
going	C
to	C
see	O
any	O
of	O
this	O
peace	O
so	O
called	O
peace	O
dividend	O

i	O
mean	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
actually	O
pu-	O
put	O
something	O
together	O
and	O
make	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
large	O
government	O
social	O
programs	O
either	O
because	O
i	O
feel	O
that	O
they	O
waste	O
money	O
also	O

but	O
with	O
this	O
peace	O
dividend	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
you	O
could	O
set	O
up	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
public	O
works	O
projects	O
like	O
they	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
thirties	O
or	O
whatever	O

right	O

ex-	O
exactly	O
and	BE_IP
in	C
that	O
way	O
we	O

and	O
essentially	O
what	O
happened	O
was	O

and	O
i	O

it	O
was	O
like	O
in	O
eigh-	O
in	O
the	O
um	O
tax	O

of	O
eighty	O

of	O
a	O

this	O
this	O
ludicrous	O

that	O
that	O
that	O

probably	O
true	O

um	O
so	O
d-	O
um	O
well	O

atlanta	O
is	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
most	O
other	O
cities	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

i	O
do	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O

i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
come	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
also	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
walking	O
in	O
a	O
downtown	O
area	O
you	O
know	O
where	O
where	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
crime	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
just	O
just	O
keeping	O
your	O

about	O
you	O
and	O
you	O

with	O
well	O
not	O
silly	O
just	O

you	O

confidently	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
n't	O
be	O
looking	O
around	O
like	O
you	O
've	O
never	O

there	O
before	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
where	O
you	O
are	O

yeah	O
um-hum	O
um-hum	O
yeah	O

and	O

if	O

you	O

you	O
ever	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
mugged	O
in	O
atlanta	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
pretty	O
lucky	O
about	O
getting	O
mugged	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
yeah	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
've	O
only	O
actually	O
seen	O
like	O
one	O
you	O
know	O
one	O
actual	O
robbery	O
with	O
a	O
gun	O
and	O
that	O
's	O
been	O
about	O
the	O
only	O
you	O
know	O
real	O
violent	O
crime	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
potentially	O
violent	O
crime	O
that	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O
in	O
atlanta	O

and	O
that	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
a	O
guy	O
running	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
store	O
that	O
he	O
just	O
robbed	O

oh	O
really	O

wow	O
where	O
was	O
where	O
where	O
was	O
that	O

was	O
that	O
downtown	O

or	O

really	O

um-hum	O
metropolitan	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
i	O
've	O
actually	O
i	O
've	O
known	O
known	O
some	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
had	O
their	O
cars	O
stolen	O

um	O
and	O
uh	O
and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
half	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
the	O
a._p._d.	O
seems	O
to	O
recover	O
them	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
in	O
various	O
states	O
of	O
disrepair	O

up	O
on	O
blocks	O
you	O
know	O

my	O
friend	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
um	O
v._w.	O
rabbit	O

and	O
when	O
he	O
when	O
he	O
got	O
it	O
back	O
his	O
um	O
dashboard	O
was	O
sitting	O
in	O
in	O
his	O
front	O
seat	O

um-hum	O

well	O
you	O
're	O
probably	O
luckier	O
than	O

um-hum	O

um	O
so	O
does	O
like	O
insurance	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
body	O
damage	O

or	O
was	O
that	O
was	O
that	O
all	O
it	O
was	O
body	O

oh	O
um-hum	O

um-hum	O

so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
this	O
much	O
about	O
um	O
stealing	O
cars	O

right	O

i-	O
i-	O
i	O
actually	O
i	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
concern	O
of	O
mine	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
safety	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

um	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
bad	O
in	O
certain	O
areas	O

however	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
the	O
area	O
that	O
i	O
live	O
in	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
uh	O
the	O
the	O
crime	O
level	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
other	O
areas	O
of	O
the	O
of	O
the	O
city	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
ce-	O
certain	O
areas	O
where	O
uh	O
the	O
crime	O
is	O
focused	O
um	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
what	O
's	O
been	O
happening	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
several	O
years	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
've	O
been	O
beefing	O
up	O
the	O
police	O
patrols	O
trying	O
to	O
put	O
put	O
more	O
guys	O
more	O
cops	O
higher	O
visibility	O

and	O
uh	O
it	O
had	O
some	O
impact	O
but	O
not	O
a	O
tremendous	O
amount	O

and	O
probably	O
um	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
increase	O
community	O
involvement	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
thing	O
i	O
think	O
's	O

the	O
best	O
way	O
there	O
is	O
yeah	O

you	O
know	O
uh	O
particularly	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
housing	O
projects	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
that	O
tends	O
to	O
be	O
where	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
crime	O
is	O
focused	O
and	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
do	O
more	O
than	O
just	O
having	O
having	O
cops	O
there	O

they	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
change	O
the	O
way	O
people	O
think	O
about	O
it	O

um	O
well	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
to	O

i	O
'd	O
say	O
it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
in	O
the	O
top	O
top	O
ten	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
crime	O

um	O
it	O
's	O
nowhere	O
near	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
new	O
york	O
city	O
for	O
example	O

probably	O
not	O
not	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
detroit	O

no	O

yeah	O

that	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
true	O

um	O
yeah	O

if	O
you	O
've	O
ever	O
been	O
to	O
like	O
new	O
york	O
city	O

and	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
as	O
you	O
walk	O
through	O
the	O
street	O
on	O
a	O
given	O
evening	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
crimes	O
being	O
committed	O

it	O
's	O
that	O
obvious	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

with	O
a	O
big	O
stick	O

or	O

right	O

sure	O

right	O

do	O
n't	O
do	O
n't	O
walk	O
down	O
a	O
an	O
alley	O

or	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
just	O
try	O
to	O
keep	O
yourself	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
bad	O
situation	O
but	O
yeah	O

there	O
are	O
times	O
when	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
avoid	O
all	O
that	O
um	O
and	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
on	O
your	O
own	O

uh	O
no	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
've	O
ever	O
had	O
is	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
my	O
wallet	O
lifted	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
a	O
a	O
setting	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
number	O
of	O

around	O

and	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
got	O

i	O
was	O
much	O
younger	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
people	O
they	O
just	O
took	O
it	O
from	O
me	O
without	O
me	O
knowing	O
really	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
passed	O
it	O
off	O
so	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
who	O

it	O

i	O
've	O

i	O
've	O

my	O

um-hum	O

i	O
've	O

my	O

so	O
maybe	O
that	O
counts	O

yeah	O

oh	O
no	O

that	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
northern	O
pa-	O
um	O
up	O
near	O
cumberland	O
mall	O
area	O

it	O

atlanta	O
and	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
car	O
thefts	O
in	O
that	O
area	O

right	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
mine	O
was	O
just	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
wrecked	O
and	O
some	O
superficial	O
type	O
damage	O

but	O
they	BE
did	IE
n't	IP
they	C
did	C
n't	C
strip	O
it	O
so	O
i	O
got	O
it	O
back	O

yeah	O

than	O
most	O

right	O

it	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
three	O
grand	O
to	O
put	O
everything	O
together	O

they	O
cracked	O
the	O
steering	O
column	O
of	O

the	O
car	O

yeah	O

you	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
you	O

the	O

then	O
you	O
pull	O
the	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
pin	O
in	O
there	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
pull	O
on	O
these	O
g._m.	O
cars	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
st-	O
start	O
it	O
up	O
basically	O
pretty	O
easily	O

well	O
after	O
i	O
found	O
mine	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
i	O
had	O
this	O

oh	O
how	O
's	O
your	O
products	O
been	O

i	O
hear	O
that	O
one	O

have	O
you	O
had	O
any	O
lately	O
go	O
out	O

oh	O
wow	O

so	O
you	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
anything	O

even	O
all	O
the	O
all	O
the	O
warranties	O
were	O
out	O

you	O
're	O
kidding	O

yeah	O

we	O
just	O
moved	O
into	O
a	O
new	O
house	O
too	O

so	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
buy	O
all	O
those	O
too	O

yeah	O

the	BE
only	IE
thing	IP
i	C
've	C
had	C
problems	O
with	O
is	O
um	O

i	O
buy	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
wood	O
working	O
equipment	O
through	O
the	O
mail	O
and	O
i	O
bought	O
this	O
paint	O
stripper	O
where	O
they	O
advertise	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
nontoxic	O
and	O
such	O

and	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
product	O
it	O
ends	O
up	O
being	O
toxic	O
and	O
all	O
these	O
warnings	O

so	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
return	O
it	O
because	O
it	O
'd	O
probably	O
cost	O
me	O
more	O
than	O

i	O
just	O
ended	O
up	O
using	O
it	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
gone	O
wrong	O

that	O
's	O
incredib-	O

and	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
out	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

or	O
two	O
days	O

wow	O

wow	O

that	O
's	O
frustrating	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

they	O
go	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O

yeah	O

see	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
the	O
manufacturing	O
field	O
i	O
-ust	O

home	O
from	O
work	O

and	O
make	O
um	O
automotive	O
air	O
bags	O
the	O
safety	O
air	O
bags	O

yeah	O

at	O
morton	O
international	O

and	O
i	O
thin-	O

well	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
changed	O
a	O
lot	O
with	O
the	O
manufacturing	O
environment	O

we	O
test	O
everything	O
after	O
each	O
assembly	O
process	O

and	O
so	O
our	O
testing	O
is	O
pretty	O
thorough	O

but	O

um	O

um	O
the	O
tests	O
that	O

well	O
we	O
test	O
every	O
one	O
electrically	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
test	O
um	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
a	O
day	O
actually	O
exploding	O
the	O
air	O
bag	O
and	O
but	O
we	O
do	O
test	O
after	O
during	O
the	O
assembly	O
proj-	O
product	O
um	O
after	O
we	O
assemble	O
each	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
inflator	O
or	O
what	O
explodes	O
the	O
bag	O
we	O
check	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
it	O
's	O
there	O
after	O
we	O
install	O
it	O

so	O
each	O
assembly	O
process	O
has	O
an	O
inspection	O
right	O
after	O
it	O
's	O
done	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
do	O
electrical	O
tests	O
on	O
them	O
during	O
the	O
process	O

so	O

yeah	O

well	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
all	O
the	O
testing	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
through	O
the	O
government	O

it	O
's	O
incredible	O
how	O
much	O
testing	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
do	O

uh-huh	O

um	O
i	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
uh	O
too	O
many	O
problems	O

uh	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
everything	O
that	O
i	O
buy	O
goes	O
bad	O
just	O
after	O
the	O
warranty	O
runs	O
out	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
a	O
dryer	O
an	O
ice	O
maker	O
a	O
microwave	O
all	O
three	O

and	O
they	O

unfortunately	O
i	O
bought	O
them	O
all	O
three	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
when	O
i	O
bought	O
my	O
new	O
house	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
recourse	O

so	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
call	O
and	O
have	O
them	O
all	O
repaired	O
and	O
that	O

yeah	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
hassle	O

yeah	O

the	O
warranty	O
on	O
the	O
refrigerator	O
uh	O

the	O
i-	O

the	O
refrigerator	O
warranty	O
's	O
still	O
good	O

but	O
the	O
ice	O
maker	O
itself	O
lasted	O
three	O
years	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
three	O
years	O
and	O
two	O
months	O

no	O

uh	O
watch	O
out	O

um-hum	O

hm	O

i	O
usually	O
have	O
pretty	O
good	O
luck	O
with	O
appliances	O

but	O
i	O
just	O
uh	O

it	O
was	O
within	O
two	O
days	O
that	O
all	O
three	O
of	O
these	O
stopped	O
working	O

and	O
the	O
the	O
ice	O
maker	O
was	O
uh	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
new	O
pump	O

and	O
the	O
uh	O
microwave	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
uh	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
something	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
even	O
pronounce	O

and	O
they	O
uh	O

the	O
dryer	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
new	O
heating	O
element	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
almost	O
three	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
for	O
all	O
three	O
of	O
them	O

uh	O
within	BE_IP
two	C
days	O
of	O
each	O
other	O

i	O
was	O

it	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
good	O
week	O

i	O
was	O
pretty	O
mad	O

and	O
plus	O
the	O
place	O
that	O
i	O
'd	O
bought	O
um	O
them	O
all	O
had	O
gone	O
out	O
of	O
business	O

so	O
even	O
if	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
even	O
if	O
i	O
had	O
uh	O
had	O
kept	O
the	O
warranty	O
the	O
service	O
agreements	O
were	O
with	O
the	O
companies	O
that	O
that	O
manufactured	O

but	O
still	O
they	O
were	O
through	O
that	O
retailer	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
i	O
could	O
've	O
taken	O
it	O
to	O
another	O
retailer	O
or	O
not	O

but	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
all	O
that	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
under	O
warranty	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
call	O
to	O
the	O
local	O
appliance	O
dealer	O
who	O
came	O
out	O
and	O
fixed	O
them	O
all	O

but	O
i	O

the	O
only	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
've	O
ever	O
had	O
trouble	O
with	O
um	O

i	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
real	O
bad	O
trouble	O
with	O
electric	O
hair	O

blow	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
those	O
go	O
out	O

one	O
was	O
under	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
were	O
n't	O

but	O
i	O
just	O

other	BE_IP

that	O
you	O

oh	O
really	O

that	O
's	O
interesting	O

do	O
you	O
do	O
you	O
test	O
each	O

or	O
do	O
you	O
just	O

if	O
you	O

you	O

one	O

and	O
by	O
the	O

um-hum	O

that	O

another	O
one	O
that	O
that	O
that	O
i	O

yeah	O

getting	O
a	O

a	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

right	O

well	O
um	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
actually	O
on	O
the	O

but	O
we	O

and	O
that	O
's	O

um	O
and	O
we	O
're	O
given	O
you	O

a	O
good	O
bit	O
of	O
flexibility	O
in	O
what	O
we	O
do	O

we	O
can	O
kind	O
of	O
pursue	O
our	O

in	O

that	O
we	O

right	O

right	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
yeah	O

um-hum	O

okay	O
are	O
there	O
are	O
there	O
any	O
things	O
that	O
that	O
you	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
changed	O
in	O

of	O
the	O
the	O

uh	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
the	O
medical	O
uh	O
group	O
insurance	O
uh	O
area	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
uh	O
covering	O
medical	O

for	O
yourself	O
or	O

yeah	O

i	O
thin-	O

i	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
a	O
public	O
school	O
system	O
district	O
and	O
uh	O
so	O
it	O
's	O
different	O
than	O
a	O
company	O
where	O
most	O
companies	O
fund	O
almost	O
the	O
entire	O
thing	O

where	O
the	O
school	O
district	O
does	O
um	O
the	O
employee	O
must	O
pick	O
up	O
a	O
greater	O
figure	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
uh	O
costs	O

but	O
i-	O
overall	O
um	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
pleased	O
with	O
it	O
over	O
the	O
years	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
biggest	O
frustration	O
is	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
insurance	O
going	O
up	O
every	O
year	O
our	O
district	O
has	O
had	O
to	O
alter	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
change	O
companies	O

or	O
now	O
we	O
're	O
on	O
a	O
managed	O
care	O
thing	O
which	O
has	O
stressed	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
out	O
although	O
it	O
has	O
not	O
disturbed	O
me	O
any	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

yeah	O

our	O
district	O
did	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
ninety	O
one	O
and	O
the	O
ninety	O
school	O
year	O
or	O
calendar	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
h._m._o.	O

and	O
um	BE_IP
i-	C
i	C
was	O
because	O
my	O
my	O
same	O
doctor	O
you	O
know	O
agreed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
it	O
for	O
uh	O

they	O
usually	O
sign	O
a	O
contract	O
or	O
something	O
and	O
um	O
uh	O
i	O
did	O
have	O
surgery	O
last	O
summer	O

and	O
i	O
paid	O
ten	O
dollars	O
when	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
that	O
first	O
day	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
seen	O
another	O
bill	O

so	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C_IP
have	C
to	O
say	O
it	O
really	O
works	O

but	O
again	O
i	O
was	O
fortunate	O
because	O
my	O
doctor	O
agreed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
it	O

uh	O
if	O
you	O
've	O
been	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
doctor	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
ten	O
years	O
or	O
something	O
and	O
he	O
elects	O
not	O
to	O
join	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
stressful	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
those	O
people	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
you	O
know	O
have	O
a	O
family	O
and	O
and	O
um	O
everybody	O
's	O
gone	O
to	O
different	O
doctors	O
uh	O
it	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
give	O
up	O
somebody	O
who	O
you	O
feel	O
knows	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
body	O
and	O
your	O
just	O
has	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
the	O
medical	O
history	O

and	O
you	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
with	O
it	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
sure	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
stressful	O

and	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
just	O
elected	O
that	O
if	O
that	O
happens	O
i	O
will	O
go	O
and	O
just	O
pay	O

you	O
can	O
continue	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
your	O
own	O
doctor	O
but	O
your	O
benefits	O
are	O
not	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
good	O

so	O
uh	O

oh	O
all	O
right	O

i	O
do	O
too	O

are	O
you	O
talking	O
about	O
like	O
spring	O
break	O

and	O

right	O

right	O

it	O
it	O
really	O
um	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
teachers	O

now	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
a	O
teacher	O

i	O
am	O
the	O
a	O
secretarial	O
executive	O
assistant	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	O
teachers	O
could	O
stand	O
the	O
stress	O
all	O
all	O
year	O
long	O
frankly	O

it	O
is	O
just	O
texas	O
has	O
really	O
um	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
want	O
everybody	O
educated	O
no	O
matter	O
what	O
it	O
's	O
costs	O

uh	O
and	O
it	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
just	O

we	O
all	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O

like	O
in	O
two	O
weeks	O
we	O
have	O
spring	O
break	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

you	O
're	O
you	O
're	O
one	O
day	O
you	O

incorporate	O
the	O
video	O
um	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
bike	O
on	O

day	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
really	O
amazing	O
how	O
fast	O
the	O
inches	O
come	O
off	O

and	O
the	O
muscle	O
builds	O
real	O
fast	O

um	O
you	O
can	O
start	O

they	O
recommend	O
doing	O
the	O
video	O
without	O
weights	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
month	O

and	O
then	O
after	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
start	O
with	O
your	O
five	O
pound	O
dumbbells	O
and	O
then	O
build	O
up	O
to	O
your	O
uh	O
twenty	O
five	O
pound	O
dumbbells	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
just	O
doing	O
repetitious	O
exercises	O
throughout	O
the	O
whole	O
video	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
hour	O
long	O
video	O

so	O

it	O
is	O

yeah	O

i	O
really	O
enjoy	O
that	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
losing	O
this	O
weight	O
and	O
being	O
firm	O
and	O
healthy	O

yes	O

yes	O

now	O
this	O
one	O
has	O
been	O
quite	O
mild	O

um	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
out	O
walking	O
throughout	O
the	O
whole	O
winter	O
because	O
really	O
we	O
only	O
had	O
about	O
three	O
weeks	O
of	O
snow	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O

it	O
was	O
quite	O
chilly	O

but	O
not	O

yes	O

i	O
do	O

uh	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
uh	O
play	O
basketball	O
and	O
weight	O
lifting	O

those	O
are	O
probably	O
the	O
two	O
main	O
things	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
do	O

yeah	O

um	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
in	O
the	O
winter	O
you	O
typically	O
it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
too	O
cold	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
do	O
things	O
like	O
tennis	O

um	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
play	O
tennis	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
time	O
or	O
in	O
the	O
spring	O
fall	O

but	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
it	O
it	O
's	O
gets	O
pretty	O
cold	O

um	O
yeah	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
indoor	O
sports	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O

um	O
how	O
about	O
yourself	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

right	O

do	O
you	O
uh	O
do	O
any	O
anaerobic	O
type	O
weight	O
lifting	O
or	O
weight	O
training	O
type	O
exercise	O

um-hum	O

huh	O

yes	O

it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
aerob-	O
it	O
's	O
similar	O
to	O
aerobics	O
with	O
weights	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
low	O
impact	O
aerobics	O
where	O
you	O
use	O
weights	O

okay	O

are	O
you	O
familiar	O
with	O
um	O
step	O
or	O
bench	O
aerobics	O

uh	O
yes	O

i	O
have	O

in	O
in	O
atlanta	O
that	O
's	O
um	O

most	O
of	O
the	O
health	O
clubs	O
are	O
all	O

that	BE
's	IP
the	C
that	C
's	C
the	O
in	O
thing	O

at	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
regular	O
aerobics	O

but	O
now	O
bench	O
or	O
step	O
aerobics	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
taken	O
over	O

um	O
it	O
they	O
call	O
it	O
a	O
low	O
impact	O
aerobics	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
supposed	O
to	O
burn	O
off	O
more	O
calories	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

and	BE_IP
from	C
when	C
i	O
've	O
done	O
it	O
it	O
does	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
good	O
a	O
real	O
good	O
workout	O

but	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
'm	O
concerned	O
about	O
is	O
potential	O
for	O
injury	O
to	O
your	O
knees	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
and	O
movement	O
of	O
going	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
step	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
could	O
create	O
a	O
problem	O

they	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
it	O
wo	O
n't	O

but	O
you	O
never	O
know	O

yeah	O

i	O
i	O
think	O
my	O
ankles	O
probably	O
are	O
my	O
lame	O
weak	O
point	O

but	BE_IP
i	C_IE
've	C_IP
i	C
've	C
kind	O
of	O
taken	O
care	O
of	O
that	O

i	O
wear	O
high	O
tops	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
an	O
an	O
a	O
support	O
ankle	O
brace	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
stiff	O
and	O
um	O
we-	O
wearing	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
any	O
problems	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
year	O
or	O
so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
did	O
i	O
injured	O
mine	O
so	O
many	O
times	O
that	O
rehabilitating	O
became	O
quite	O
easy	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
would	O
only	O
take	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
play	O
again	O
on	O
it	O
because	O
after	O
a	O
while	O
you	O
just	O
learn	O
how	O
to	O
to	O
rehabilitate	O
yourself	O
to	O
play	O
that	O
way	O

but	O
um	O
so	O
how	O
how	O
successful	O
is	O
your	O
exercise	O
video	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
workout	O

um-hum	O

so	O
in	BE
the	IP
winter	C_IE
i	C_IE
guess	C_IP
there	C
's	C
a	O
lot	O
uh	O

it	O
's	O
quite	O
cold	O
and	O
and	O
snow	O

so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
your	O
current	O
event	O
information	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

um-hum	O

i	O
would	O
imagine	O
going	O
to	O
college	O
though	O
your	O
professors	O
and	O
different	O
things	O

you	O
keep	O
up	O
on	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

yeah	O

right	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
housewife	O

i	O
have	O
three	O
kids	O

and	O
so	O
um	O
i	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
information	O
probably	O
through	O
just	O
the	O
news	O
at	O
six	O
o'clock	O
and	O
then	O
um	O
talking	O
with	O
people	O
and	O
just	O
hearing	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

but	O
just	O
the	O
regular	O
channel	O
just	O
channel	O
eight	O

that	O
's	O
our	O
channel	O
here	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
um	O
eyewitness	O
news	O

so	O

oh	O
uh-huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
elections	O
they	O
choose	O
who	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
follow	O
and	O
who	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

and	O
basically	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
a	O
c-	O
candidate	O
can	O
get	O
them	O
to	O
follow	O
then	O
the	O
news	O
will	O
you	O
know	O
kind	O
of	O
publicize	O
his	O
name	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
get	O
the	O
news	O
is	O
the	O
right	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
it	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
very	O
lopsided	O
picture	O
of	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

right	O

right	O

and	O
the	O
news	O
too	O
it	O
just	O
does	O
n't	O
um	O
cover	O
a-	O
that	O
many	O
stories	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
just	O
covers	O
your	O
basic	O
you	O
know	O
violent	O
crimes	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
your	O
ca-	O
catastrophes	O
with	O
weather	O
and	O
stuff	O

but	O
other	O
than	O
that	O
you	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

um	O
i	O
will	O
read	O
our	O
current	O
letters	O
that	O
come	O
out	O
on	O
elections	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
read	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
study	O
who	O
's	O
running	O
in	O
our	O
area	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
study	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
economy	O

it	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
read	O
other	O
magazines	O
um	O
too	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
information	O

right	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
used	O
to	O
read	O
every	O
month	O
a	O
reader	O
's	O
digest	O
but	O
um	O
now	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
just	O
have	O
friends	O
that	O
clip	O
articles	O

or	O
if	BE_IP
i	C
you	O
know	O
am	O
interested	O
in	O
something	O
of	O
course	O
during	O
the	O
w-	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
war	O
i	O
read	O
up	O
on	O
that	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
in	O
the	O
newspaper	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
times	O
i	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
wish	O
i	O
had	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
read	O
all	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

but	O
i	O
just	O
ca	O
n't	O
seem	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
time	O

if	O
they	O
'd	O
put	O
it	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
video	O
or	O
on	O
not	O
a	O
video	O
but	O
a	O
cassette	O
tape	O
or	O
something	O
where	O
you	O
could	O
just	O
listen	O
to	O
it	O
i	O
would	O
do	O
that	O
while	O
i	O
was	O
doing	O
other	O

but	O

right	O

well	O
i	O
um	O
they	O
even	O
did	O
a	O
story	O
on	O
our	O

here	O
in	O
texas	O
on	O
what	O
people	O
wanted	O

you	O

dur-	O
back	O
during	O
the	O
uh	O
during	O
the	O
war	O
everyone	O
here	O
at	O
work	O
always	O
had	O
the	O
radio	O
or	O
the	O
t._v.	O
on	O
because	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
constantly	O
with	O
that	O
stuff	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

if	O
they	O
reported	O
every	O
m-	O
if	O
they	O
reported	O
every	O
violent	O
crime	O
in	O
atlanta	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
it	O
would	O
probably	O
take	O
the	O
whole	O
news	O
hour	O

but	O
uh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

that	O
's	O

they	O
still	O
already	O
they	O
're	O
having	O
like	O
um	O

in	O
the	O
newspaper	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
section	O
i	O
think	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
o-	O
on	O
the	O
olympics	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
like	O
a	O
countdown	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
sixteen	O
hundred	O
days	O
or	O
something	O

oh	O
really	O

that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
crazy	O
that	O
time	O
of	O
year	O
here	O

but	O
uh	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
believe	O
i	O
mean	O

they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
uh	O
stretching	O
out	O
the	O
olympic	O
news	O
for	O
that	O
much	O
coverage	O
over	O

i	O
guess	O
people	O
want	O
to	O
hear	O
about	O
it	O

also	O
big	O
in	O
big	O
in	O
the	O
news	O
right	O
now	O
is	O
the	O
braves	O
because	O
they	O
're	O
uh	O
they	O
're	O
in	O
you	O
know	O
tr-	O
spring	O
training	O
or	O
whatever	O
and	O
they	O
did	O
so	O
well	O
last	O
year	O

yeah	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
they	O
way	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
newscasts	O
uh	O
i	O
wish	O
they	O
they	O
kind	O
of	O
separated	O
it	O
you	O
know	O

or	O
if	O
you	O
wanted	O
to	O
watch	O
one	O
thing	O
you	O
could	O
turn	O
to	O
s-	O
some	O
channel	O
for	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
cable	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
one	O
uh	O
advantage	O
of	O
having	O
uh	O
the	O
unanimous	O
verdict	O
is	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
criminal	O
case	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
uh	O
convict	O
someone	O
who	O
uh	O
really	O
should	O
n't	O
be	O
convicted	O

um	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
unanimous	O
verdict	O
uh	O
helps	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O

i	O
guess	O
uh	O
maybe	O
one	O
drawback	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
one	O
juror	O
who	O
is	O
very	O
unreasonable	O
in	O
some	O
way	O
that	O
uh	O
you	O
uh	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
n't	O
convict	O
someone	O
who	O
maybe	O
should	O
be	O
convicted	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O
before	O

oh	O

uh	O
what	O
sorts	O
of	O
cases	O
were	O
they	O

so	O
were	O
they	O
criminal	O
or	O
civil	O

oh	O
okay	O

what	O
uh	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
verdict	O

did	O
the	O
did	O
the	O
jury	O
have	O
trouble	O
reaching	O
a	O
decision	O

yeah	O

so	O
did	O
it	O
become	O

yeah	O

ah	O

oh	O
but	BE
since	IP
it	C
was	C
a	O
civil	O
case	O
it	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
matter	O
right	O

you	O
just	O
needed	O
a	O
majority	O

what	O
was	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
other	O
case	O

that	O
was	O
also	O
civil	O

yeah	O

oh	O
did	O
n't	O
really	O
even	O
count	O

yeah	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	O
college	O
student	O

so	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
you	O
know	O
of	O
a	O
jury	O
eligible	O
age	O
for	O
very	O
long	O
um	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
did	O
get	O
um	O
one	O
summons	O
actually	O
at	O
one	O
point	O

but	O
i	O
declined	O
it	O
which	O
i	O
'm	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
student	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
uh	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
time	O

yeah	O
i	O
mean	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
uh	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
at	O
some	O
point	O
um	O

but	O
uh	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
have	O
n't	O

um	O
one	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
i-	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
maybe	O
is	O
a	O
problem	O
is	O
uh	O
i-	O
i-	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
criminal	O
jury	O
system	O
works	O
pretty	O
well	O
now	O

but	O
i	O
wonder	O
if	O
maybe	O
in	O
some	O
civil	O
cases	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
work	O
as	O
well	O

uh	O
especially	O
sort	O
of	O

ow	O
well	O

the	O
ah	O
but	O
you	O
thought	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O

yeah	O

oh	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
zoo	O

and	O
the	O
jurors	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O

someone	O
had	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O

hum	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

did	O
it	O
did	O
it	O
work	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O
in	O
the	O
end	O

i	O
mean	O
did	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
people	O
sort	O
of	O
gradually	O
sort	O
of	O
assume	O
uh	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
moderator	O
role	O
in	O
the	O
trial	O

or	O

so	O
it	O
worked	O
it	O
did	O
end	O
up	O
working	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O

the	O
one	O
thing	O
i	O
sometimes	O
wonder	O
about	O
um	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
is	O
uh	O
whether	O
especially	O
sort	O
of	O
in	O
uh	O
maybe	O
like	O
pro-	O
product	O
liability	O
or	O
medical	O
malpractice	O
where	O
there	O
's	O
um	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
technical	O
decision	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
sometimes	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
just	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
um	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
did	O
this	O
guy	O
rip	O
off	O
this	O
guy	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
interpreting	O
a	O
contract	O

it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
sometimes	O
getting	O
into	O
very	O
technical	O
issues	O

and	O
i	O
wonder	O
if	O
uh	O
if	O
there	O
's	O
really	O
um	O
if	O
the	O
system	O
works	O
adequately	O
in	O
in	O
educating	O
the	O
jurors	O
about	O
uh	O
whatever	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
issue	O
is	O
under	O
discussion	O

in	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
you	O
were	O
involved	O
in	O
you	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
a	O
bank	O
matter	O
of	O
some	O
kind	O

so	O

yeah	O

ah	O

oh	O
so	O
the	O
deal	O
was	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
uh	O
borrowed	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
bank	O
to	O
buy	O
it	O

and	O
he	O
had	O
n't	O
made	O
the	O
payments	O

yeah	O

ah	O
so	O
they	O
were	O
suing	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
back	O

ah	O

yeah	O

uh	O

definitely	O

um-hum	O

uh	O
i	O
have	O
twice	O

it	O
was	O
pretty	O
wild	O
experience	O

they	O
were	O
just	O
you	O
know	O
small	O
town	O
cases	O
where	O
uh	O
trailers	O
and	O
banks	O
were	O
involved	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
were	O
civil	O

they	O
were	O
n't	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
any	O
criminal	O

uh	O
the	O
jury	O
it	O
was	O
uh	O
let	O
me	O
see	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
ten	O
to	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O
because	O
they	O
only	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
eleven	O
people	O
so	O
it	O
was	O

they	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
one	O
changed	O
his	O
vote	O
at	O
the	O
end	O

so	O
it	O
became	O
unanimous	O
you	O
know	O
after	O
they	O
turned	O
it	O
in	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
changed	O
his	O
mind	O
after	O
they	O
turned	O
it	O
in	O
but	O
it	O
then	O
became	O
unanimous	O

so	O
right	O

the	O
the	O
uh	O
other	O
case	O
was	O
just	O
traffic	O

the	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
seat	O
belt	O
law	O
and	O
it	O
it	O
did	O
n't	O
even	O
hardly	O
go	O
through	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
you	O
learn	O
a	O
lot	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
juries	O
like	O
that	O
though	O

it	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
i	O
mean	O
from	O
from	O
my	O
e-	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
experienced	O
in	O
them	O

it	O
did	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
did	O
n't	O
did	O
n't	O
turn	O
out	O
the	O
as	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
planned	O
it	O
i	O
mean	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
i	O
would	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
go	O

it	O
yeah	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O

jury	O
was	O
unorganized	O

and	BE_IP
it	C
was	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
was	O
n't	O
organized	O
enough	O
for	O
me	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
used	O
to	O
it	O
not	O
being	O
organized	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
a-	O
assumed	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O

that	O
's	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
what	O
it	O
was	O

yeah	O

they	O
well	O
they	O
picked	O
the	O
one	O
person	O

and	O
then	O
he	O
finally	O
you	O
know	O
moderated	O
everything	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
turn	O
out	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
should	O
have	O

so	O
yeah	O

it	O
ended	O
up	O
working	O
all	O
right	O

yes	O

uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
they	O
they	O
educate	O
them	O
enough	O
to	O
to	O
really	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

yeah	O

the	O
bank	O
was	O
suing	O
them	O
for	O
uh	O
because	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
the	O
trailer	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
assumably	O
their	O
property	O

it	O
was	O
on	O
his	O
property	O

right	O

so	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
get	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
well	O
i-	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
landlord	O
's	O
property	O

and	O
he	O
would	O
n't	O
let	O
them	O
take	O
it	O
off	O

so	O
and	O
they	O
'd	O
already	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
double	O

they	O
'd	O

they	O

then	O
when	O

it	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
days	O
later	O
it	O
had	O

and	O

all	O
in	O
it	O

so	O
they	O
were	O
suing	O
him	O
for	O
the	O
money	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
's	O

and	O
i	BE

i	C
think	C
the	O

is	O
the	O

uh	O
really	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

right	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

uh	O
do	O
you	O
uh	O

are	O
there	O
cases	O
where	O
you	O

that	O
that	O
uh	O
the	O
capital	O
capital	O

should	O
n't	O
be	O
uh	O
uh	O

um-hum	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

sure	O

yeah	O

i	O
understand	O
i	O
understand	O
your	O
point	O

yeah	O

uh	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
with	O
uh	O
with	O
with	O
dahlmer	O
now	O
uh	O
y-	O
you	O
realize	O
that	O
ohi-	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
ohio	O
uh	O
gets	O
to	O
try	O
him	O
next	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
have	O
the	O
death	O

yeah	O

so	O
uh	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
curious	O
case	O

i	O

uh	O
uh	O
that	O
was	O
something	O
is	O
sort	O
of	O
nightmarish	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
least	O

uh	O
well	O
here	O
in	O
texas	O
we	O
uh	O

i	O
think	O
even	O
even	O
this	O
last	O
week	O
uh	O
last	O
week	O
they	O
had	O
another	O
they	O
uh	O
you	O

they	O
use	O
their	O
capital	O
punishment	O
by	O
lethal	O
injection	O
uh	O
uh	O

yeah	O

we	O
do	O
have	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
here	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
exercised	O
very	O
often	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
it	O

i	O
believe	O
it	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
even	O
remember	O
the	O
last	O
execution	O
we	O
had	O
here	O
actually	O
uh	O
personally	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
capital	O
punishment	O

i	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
lot	O
of	O
problems	O
with	O
it	O

but	O
uh	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
some	O
crimes	O
are	O
just	O
so	O
heinous	O
that	O
that	O
the	O
person	O
just	O
uh	O
i	O
feel	O
does	O
n't	O
deserve	O
to	O
live	O
does	O
n't	O
deserve	O
for	O
the	O
tax	O
payers	O
to	O
spend	O
however	O
many	O
thousands	O
of	O
dollars	O
it	O
costs	O
a	O
year	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
in	O
prison	O
for	O
life	O

uh	O
i	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
problems	O
with	O
that	O

like	O
well	O
they	O
say	O
okay	O
if	O
you	O
declare	O
someone	O
put	O
them	O
on	O
death	O
row	O
and	O
execute	O
them	O
well	O
then	O
ten	O
la-	O
years	O
later	O
you	O
find	O
out	O
that	O
he	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
then	O
that	O
life	O
was	O
wasted	O

but	O
just	O
seems	O
like	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
policy	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

right	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
thought	O
that	O
i	O
had	O
never	O
really	O
had	O
on	O
that	O
wh-	O
which	O
seems	O
pretty	O
sensible	O

right	O

right	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

you	BE
're	IP
you	C
're	C
right	O
there	O

uh	O
i	O
ju-	O
basically	O
my	O
views	O
i	O
guess	O
they	O
tend	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
economically	O
oriented	O
in	O
that	O
i	O
just	O
y-	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
come	O
out	O
with	O
these	O
figures	O
that	O
it	O
costs	O
fifty	O
thousand	O
dollars	O
taxpayer	O
dollars	O
a	O
year	O
to	O
keep	O
someone	O
alive	O
in	O
jail	O
when	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
there	O
for	O
life	O

they	O
're	O
never	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
rehabilitated	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
prison	O
system	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
today	O
does	O
much	O
towards	O
rehabilitation	O
to	O
begin	O
with	O
so	O
to	O
me	O
i	O
'm	O
paying	O
taxes	O
you	O
know	O
twenty	O
percent	O
of	O
my	O
check	O
or	O
whatever	O
to	O
keep	O
somebody	O
alive	O
who	O
i	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
should	O
n't	O
be	O
there	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
and	O
is	O
never	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
valuable	O
or	O
worthwhile	O
part	O
of	O
society	O

so	BE
i	IP
i	C
'm	C
all	O
in	O

of	O
it	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
on	O
that	O
question	O

it	O
just	O
seems	O
like	O

for	O
instance	O
the	O
jeffrey	O
dahlmer	O
case	O

i	O
mean	O
i-	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
person	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
ever	O
be	O
a	O
worthwhile	O
part	O
of	O
society	O

i	O
hope	O
the	O
guy	O
never	O
gets	O
back	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
streets	O
and	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
wisconsin	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
death	O
penalty	O

so	O
he	BE
's	IP
going	C
to	C
be	O
sentenced	O
to	O
life	O
imprisonment	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
live	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
playing	O
god	O
which	O
is	O
n-	O
never	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

but	O
cases	O
where	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
should	O
be	O
withheld	O
uh	O
not	O
really	O
that	O
i	O
can	O
think	O
of	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
would	O
i	O
would	O
be	O
in	O

of	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
in	O
things	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
murders	O
and	O
like	O
you	O
said	O
repeat	O
murders	O
or	O
serial	O
killers	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
uh	O
death	O
penalty	O
for	O
people	O
like	O
noriega	O
and	O
such	O
as	O
that	O

i	O

that	O
they	O
're	O
they	O

more	O

i	O

tha-	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
in	O
our	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

y-	O
yeah	O

that	O
is	O
very	O

that	BE

that	C

okay	O

i	O

it	O
took	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O

has	O

now	O

uh	O

i	O
served	O

i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O

on	O
a	O
court	O

uh	O
board	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
similar	O
to	O
a	O

a	O

the	O

have	O
you	O

uh-huh	O

was	O
it	O

a	O

some-	O
uh-huh	O

i	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
did	BE_IP

did	O
you	O

that	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

no	O

that	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
science	O
in	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
see	O

because	O
you	O
'd	O
probably	O
be	O
uh	O
too	O
puritanical	O

and	O
to	O
uh-huh	O

so	O
uh	O
were	O
were	O
the	O
uh	O
sentences	O
that	O
the	O

out	O
what	O
you	O

wow	O

i	O
bet	O
that	O
made	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

oh	O
how	O
many	O
members	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O

was	O
it	O
a	O
six	O
or	O
twelve	O
member	O
jury	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
curious	O
to	O
me	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
realize	O
until	O
the	O
uh	O
wayne	O
kennedy	O
smith	O
trial	O
uh	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
ago	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
six	O

i	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
always	O
twelve	O
twelve	O
men	O
tried	O
and	O
true	O
so	O
to	O

but	O
uh	O
apparently	O
for	O
some	O
some	O
crimes	O
it	O
's	O
permissible	O
to	O

six	O
people	O
sit	O
in	O

on	O
a	O

getting	O
to	O
this	O
unanimous	O

whether	O
you	O

a	O
jury	O
should	O
be	O
unanimous	O
or	O
not	O
or	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
court	O

case	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
require	O
the	O

to	O
be	O

it	O
's	O
s-	O
a	O
simple	O
majority	O
you	O
know	O
rules	O

yeah	O
a	O
probably	O
on	O
capital	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

we	O
were	O
n't	O
we	O

the	O
two	O
that	O
i	O
were	O
on	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
drugs	O
and	O
uh	O
we	O
were	O
uh	O
unanimous	O
in	O
acquitting	O
the	O
person	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
in	O
our	O
in	O
our	O
uh	O
gut	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O
individuals	O
were	O
both	O
guilty	O
just	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
friends	O
because	O
of	O
various	O
things	O

the	O
government	O
really	O
failed	O
to	O
prove	O
its	O
case	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
being	O
fair	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
if	O
the	O
government	O
does	O
n't	O
prove	O
its	O
case	O
no	O
matter	O
how	O
you	O
feel	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
by	O
what	O
's	O
offered	O
as	O
proof	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
acquit	O
him	O
in	O
both	O
cases	O

uh	O
yeah	O

it	O
was	O
yeah	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
critical	O
things	O
like	O
the	O
off	O
special	O
investigations	O
at	O
one	O
time	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
cases	O
had	O
videotaped	O
this	O
person	O

but	O
something	O
happened	O
to	O
the	O
camera	O
and	O
the	O
tape	O
and	O
all	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
was	O
testify	O
about	O

yeah	O

so	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O

yeah	O

i	O
finally	O
served	O
on	O
one	O
last	O
year	O

i	O
've	O
um	O
been	O
voting	O
for	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
figure	O
out	O
why	O
i	O
had	O
n't	O
been	O
called	O
yet	O
and	O
i	O
finally	O
was	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
interesting	O
experience	O

i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
boring	O

uh	O
it	O
was	O
uh	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
uh	O
well	O
let	O
's	O
see	O
it	O
was	O
municipal	O
court	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
uh	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
pool	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
criminal	O
and	O
civil	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
uh	O

well	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
we	O
spent	O
sitting	O
around	O
in	O
the	O
jury	O
room	O
and	O
getting	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
other	O
potential	O
jurors	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
always	O
we	O
was	O
exciting	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
called	O
to	O
to	O
to	O
go	O
because	O
then	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
else	O
besides	O
uh	O
just	O
sit	O
in	O
the	O
jury	O
room	O

uh	O
yeah	O

the	O
judge	O
did	O

uh	O
i	O
uh	O
i	O
had	O
a	O
hard	O
time	O
getting	O
seated	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O

i	O
kept	O
getting	O
uh	O

i	O
'd	O
be	O
questioned	O
uh	O
for	O
impaneling	O
the	O
jury	O

and	O
they	O
kept	O
uh	O
dismissing	O
me	O

course	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
reason	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
whether	O
the	O
prosecutor	O
or	O
the	O
defense	O
attorney	O
feels	O
like	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
best	O
uh	O
mix	O
for	O
their	O
case	O

so	O
they	O
ask	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
wild	O
questions	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
kept	O
getting	O
called	O
up	O
for	O
drunk	O
driving	O
uh	O
questions	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
uh	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
like	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
drink	O
any	O
more	O

yeah	O

that	O
was	O
probably	O
it	O

although	O
in	O
my	O
case	O
i	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
uh	O
sympathetic	O
with	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
got	O
caught	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

well	O
i	O
was	O
never	O
there	O
never	O
there	O
for	O
any	O
sentencing	O

uh	O
i	O
finally	O
got	O
impaneled	O
on	O
one	O
case	O
uh	O
on	O
my	O
next	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
day	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
uh	O
jury	O
room	O
to	O
uh	O
decide	O
the	O
case	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
one	O
guy	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O
who	O
announced	O
to	O
everybody	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
deliberate	O
because	O
he	O
'd	O
already	O
decided	O
that	O
the	O
guy	O
was	O
uh	O
not	O
guilty	O

and	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
vote	O
for	O
guilty	O

so	O
uh	O
they	O
appointed	O
me	O
jury	O
jury	O
foreman	O

and	O
i	O
uh	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
going	O
in	O
without	O
deliberating	O
allowed	O
us	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O
verdict	O

so	O
i	O
told	O
the	O
judge	O
that	O
uh	O
we	O
were	O
n't	O
were	O
una-	O
unable	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O
verdict	O
because	O
we	O
could	O
n't	O
get	O
one	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
jury	O
to	O
deliberate	O

so	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
tried	O
over	O
again	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
was	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
funny	O

the	O
uh	O

i	O
ju-	O
i-	BE_IP

i	O
uh	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
uh	O
uh	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
like	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
deliberate	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
uh	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
wanted	O
to	O
vote	O
guilty	O
for	O
the	O
guy	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
people	O
were	O
kind	O
of	O
mixed	O
so	O
uh	O
the	O
guy	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O
all	O
over	O
again	O

cost	O
him	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O

i	O

i	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
like	O
marijuana	O
or	O
cocaine	O

huh	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

what	O
type	O
of	O
field	O
of	O
work	O
are	O

in	O

oh	O
in	O
the	O
oil	O

explosives	O

yeah	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
'm	O
all	O

with	O
each	O
of	O
the	O

it	O
can	O
be	O
dangerous	O

or	O
do	O
they	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

it	O
's	O
probably	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
sure	O
becau-	O
anyway	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
the	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

but	O
i	O

they	O
do	O
have	O

that	O
they	O
do	O
give	O
you	O

if	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
if	O
you	O
get	O
caught	O
or	O
if	O
you	O
turn	O
yourself	O
in	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
works	O
very	O
good	O
with	O
that	O
random	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
limits	O

the	O
uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

you	O
could	O
time	O
it	O
just	O
right	O

when	IP
i	C

working	O
with	O
he	O
had	O
alcohol	O
on	O
his	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
our	O
policy	O
covers	O
that	O
or	O
not	O

that	O
'd	O
be	O
just	O
as	O
dangerous	O

huh	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

um-hum	O

and	O
i	O

it	O
's	O
mostly	O
for	O
the	O
the	O
field	O
people	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
drive	O
trucks	O
and	O
heavy	O
machinery	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

but	O
uh	O
they	O
they	O
have	O
done	O
some	O
testing	O
around	O
our	O
office	O
mostly	O
after	O
lunch	O
looking	O
for	O
people	O
drinking	O
uh	O
drinking	O
beer	O
and	O
stuff	O
at	O
lunch	O
time	O

at	O

that	O
's	O

pardon	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

they	O
they	O
they	O
they	O
'll	O
check	O
for	O

you	O
sort	O
of	O
you	O
're	O
sort	O
of	O
stuck	O
into	O
uh	O
checking	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
a	O

i	O
'm	O
in	O
the	O
oil	O
business	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
work	O
in	O
the	O

so	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
pretty	O
safe	O
environment	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	O
sounds	O
like	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
important	O
job	O
to	O
be	O
uh	O
straight	O
on	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
i-	C_IP
i	C
agree	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
under	O
certain	O
circumstances	O
especially	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
working	O
in	O
in	O
high	O
risk	O
uh	O
uh	O
industries	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
really	O
hurt	O
other	O
people	O
that	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

you	O
know	O

if	O
it	O
's	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
's	O
not	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
random	O
you	O
know	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
's	O
random	O
and	O
and	O
the	O
individual	O
's	O

uh	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
that	O
big	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
it	O

well	O
see	O
is	O

this	O
is	O
where	O
i	O
start	O
having	O
my	O
problems	O
with	O
my	O
company	O

i	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
private	O
company	O

and	O
and	O
the	O
the	O
policy	O
is	O
something	O
like	O
see	O
if	O
i	O
can	O
restate	O
this	O
correctly	O
now	O
if	O
you	O
turn	O
yourself	O
in	O
as	O
having	O
a	O
drug	O
related	O
problem	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
eligible	O
for	O
company	O
counseling	O

but	O
if	O
they	O
catch	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
test	O
positive	O
for	O
a	O
a	O

substance	O
then	O
you	O

so	O
it	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
's	C
sort	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
little	O
catch	O
twenty	O
twos	O

yeah	O

really	O

it	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
read	O
once	O

and	O
then	O
if	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
worried	O
about	O
it	O
you	O
just	O
forget	O
about	O
it	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

our	O
yeah	O

our	O
company	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
tougher	O
on	O
the	O
second	O
chance	O

i	O
mean	O
if	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
turn	O
yourself	O
in	O
then	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
think	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
to	O
uh	O
to	O
help	O
you	O
get	O
you	O
help	O
get	O
you	O

to	O
you	O

uh	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
a	O
private	O
company	O
the	O
rules	O
do	O
n't	O
always	O
apply	O

well	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
hard	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
to	O
evaluate	O
it	O
because	O
everybody	O
i	O
work	O
around	O
is	O
in	O
an	O
office	O
environment	O

and	BE
you	IP
know	C
it	C
's	C

i	O
ha-	O
have	O
n't	O
run	O

uh	O
so	O
i	O
gue-	O
you	O

it	O
works	O
uh	O
much	O
like	O
uh	O
well	O
shoot	O

any	O

i	O

everybody	O

uh	O
i	O

you	O
how	O

uh	O
there	O

uh	O
an	O

drugs	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh	O
i	O

i	O
basically	O
agree	O
that	O
uh	O

do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
okay	O
for	O
a	O
company	O
to	O
reject	O
somebody	O
just	O
knowing	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
take	O
drugs	O

i	O

they	O

out	O
some	O
other	O
way	O

yeah	O

s-	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
you	O
you	O
were	O
drug	O

or	O

yeah	O

i	O
have	O
once	O
too	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
had	O
it	O
during	O
a	O
job	O
interview	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
dumb	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
at	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
trying	O
to	O
convince	O
me	O
to	O
to	O
want	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
this	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
just	O
like	O
well	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
even	O
going	O
to	O
think	O
much	O
about	O
it	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
treat	O
me	O
with	O
this	O

even	O
before	O
you	O
've	O
gotten	O
to	O
know	O
me	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
like	O
you	O
say	O
i	O
mean	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
critical	O
kind	O
of	O
job	O
where	O
someone	O
could	O
get	O
hurt	O
then	O
really	O
what	O
people	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
i	O
mean	O
the	O
the	O
employer	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
judging	O
you	O
on	O
how	O
well	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
work	O
rather	O
than	O
on	O
these	O
other	O
factors	O

and	O
i	O
mean	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
doing	O
drugs	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
causing	O
a	O
problem	O
then	O
they	O
'll	O
notice	O
it	O
for	O
other	O
reasons	O

yeah	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
should	O
be	O
illegal	O
for	O
an	O
employer	O
to	O
do	O
this	O

or	O

yeah	O

hum	O
i	O
tend	O
to	O
to	O
view	O
it	O

even	O

i	O

i	O
'd	O
work	O
for	O
a	O

uh	O

that	O
it	O

uh	O
too	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
severe	O

i	BE

i	C
think	C
wh-	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
problem	O
here	O
is	O
is	O
that	O
a	O
a	O
drug	O

does	O
not	O
necessarily	O
imply	O
that	O
someone	O
is	O
taking	O

there	O

a	O
few	O
years	O
ago	O

and	O
there	O
were	O

we	O
sent	O
out	O

uh	O
announcements	O
because	O
our	O
family	O
is	O
quite	O
large	O
like	O
your	O
your	O
family	O
there	O

and	O
so	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
real	O
challenge	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
president	O
of	O
our	O
family	O
reunion	O
for	O
two	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
n't	O
sure	O
i	O
appreciated	O
that	O
duty	O
for	O
two	O
years	O
in	O
a	O
row	O

but	O
i	O
found	O
that	O
advance	O
planning	O
was	O
the	O
key	O
to	O
success	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
well	O
that	O
was	O
wonderful	O
though	O

oh	O

oh	O
well	O
that	O
is	O
that	O
is	O
helpful	O

yeah	O

our	O
family	O
ranges	O
from	O
oh	O
goodness	O
well	O
australia	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
brother	O
lives	O
in	O
australia	O
to	O
uh	O
boise	O
idaho	O
and	O
and	O
uh	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
places	O

we	O
are	O

oh	O

in	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

boy	O

oh	O
my	O
gosh	O

they	O
must	O
really	O
like	O
it	O

bi-	O

-llo	O

that	O
's	O
okay	O

i	O
'm	O
bill	O
from	O
raleigh	O

oh	O
so	O
another	O
one	O
from	O
a	O
different	O
state	O
besides	O
texas	O

right	O

uh	O
yes	O

and	O
no	O

it	O
was	O
n't	O
really	O
a	O
fa-	O
a	O
planning	O
one	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
birthday	O
and	O
i	O
brought	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
family	O
together	O
then	O

it	O
went	O
pretty	O
good	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
've	C
worked	O
in	O
hotels	O

so	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
these	O
things	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
you	O
know	O

usually	O
when	O
we	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
our	O
family	O
reunion	O
it	O
's	O
my	O
grandmother	O
's	O
birthday	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
it	O
's	O
all	O
of	O
like	O
she	O
she	O
comes	O
from	O
a	O
big	O
family	O

she	O
has	O
like	O
seven	O
sisters	O
i	O
think	O

and	O
they	O
show	O
up	O
and	O
all	O
their	O
kids	O

and	O
then	O
a-	O
she	O
has	O
uh	O

i	O
have	O
like	O
uh	O

let	BE_IP
's	C
see	O

she	O
has	O
four	O
sons	O
and	BE_IP
two	C
daughters	O

and	O
they	O
show	O
up	O
and	O
all	O
their	O
kids	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
big	O
reunion	O

it	O
's	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
people	O
maybe	O

um	O
the	O
probably	O
the	O
biggest	O
challenge	O
was	O
uh	O
getting	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
everyone	O
you	O
know	O
could	O
eat	O
comfortably	O
and	O
and	O
everything	O
uh	O

i	O
guess	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O
helpful	O
thing	O
was	O
that	O
uh	O
for	O
the	O
rent	O
uh	O
we	O
rented	O
like	O
a	O
a	O
rescue	O
squad	O
building	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
uh	O
each	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
everybody	O
that	O
showed	O
up	O
do-	O
donated	O
some	O
money	O
for	O
the	O
rent	O
and	O
for	O
for	O
like	O
soft	O
drinks	O

and	O
and	O
so	O
nobody	O
like	O
really	O
got	O
stuck	O
with	O
the	O
bill	O

each	O
person	O
in	O
the	O
family	O
you	O
know	O
brought	O
a	O
dish	O
or	O
some	O

it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
potluck	O

you	O
know	O
everybody	O
brought	O
their	O
specialties	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
would	O
say	O

yeah	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
my	O
grandmother	O
's	O
food	O
was	O
as	O
always	O
gone	O
first	O
because	O
she	BE
's	IP
such	C
a	C
great	O
cook	O

uh	O
she	O
's	O
eighty	O
six	O

now	O
she	O
does	O

she	O
looks	O
probably	O
like	O
she	O
's	O
in	O
her	O
early	O
sixties	O
and	O
if	O
she	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
arthritis	O
she	O
'd	O
get	O
around	O
better	O
than	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O

oh	O
yeah	O

uh	O
my	O
nickname	O
for	O
her	O
is	O
honey	O
woman	O

that	BE
's	IP
what	C
i	C
call	O
her	O

uh	BE_IP
also	C
one	C
thing	O
that	O
's	O
helpful	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
your	O
family	O
's	O
spread	O
out	O
or	O
whatever	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
all	O
my	O
family	O
lives	O
like	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
county	O

so	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
get	O
on	O
the	O
telephone	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
so	O
and	O
such	O
days	O
from	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
date	O
and	O
everybody	O
just	O
shows	O
up	O

i	O
would	O
say	O
you	O
're	O
spread	O
out	O
then	O

uh	O
my	O
my	O
immediate	O
family	O
you	O
know	O
my	O
my	O
parents	O
and	O
my	O
brothers	O
and	O
sisters	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
have	O
the	O
gypsy	O
blood	O
or	O
whatever	O

because	O
my	O

was	O
in	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

oh	O
my	O
word	O

well	O
that	O
sounds	O
adventuresome	O

well	O
um	O
i	O
've	O
done	O
oh	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
camping	O
mostly	O
with	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O

um	O
we	O
have	O
five	O
children	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
camping	O
with	O
the	O
little	O
ones	O
is	O
n't	O
as	O
enjoyable	O
as	O
just	O
when	O
we	O
go	O
ourselves	O

so	O
we	O
've	O
tried	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
once	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
go	O
on	O
a	O
anniversary	O
camp	O
out	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
gone	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
mountains	O
and	O
uh	O
not	O
necessarily	O
roughed	O
it	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
just	O
found	O
it	O
just	O
real	O
enjoyable	O
to	O
be	O
alone	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
boys	O
are	O
our	O
boys	O
are	O
old	O
enough	O
now	O

they	O
're	O
twelve	O
and	O
eleven	O

and	O
so	O
they	O
're	O
in-	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
scouting	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
camping	O
with	O
the	O
scouts	O
and	O
last	O
year	O
my	O
one	O
twelve	O
year	O
old	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
scout	O
camp	O
for	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
so	O
this	O
year	O
they	O
'll	O
both	O
be	O
going	O

and	O
so	O
that	O
's	O
been	O
real	O
enjoyable	O
for	O
them	O

so	O

um	O
yes	O

they	O
've	O
well	O

no	O

actually	O
they	O
've	O
i	O
remember	O
they	O
have	O
taken	O
the	O
the	O
du-	O
the	O
heavy	O
cast	O
iron	O
dutch	O
ovens	O
and	O
done	O
their	O
cooking	O
there	O
over	O
the	O
fire	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
they	O
've	O
taken	O
the	O
stoves	O

um	O
last	O
year	O
they	O
camped	O
in	O
tents	O

and	O
this	O
year	O
i	O
believe	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
tents	O
also	O

so	O
uh-huh	O

yeah	O

oh	O
is	O
that	O
right	O

oh	O
and	O
what	O
does	O
that	O
consist	O

we	O
go	O
backpacking	O

so	O
we	O
go	O
backpacking	O
fifteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
miles	O
then	O
uh	O

they	O
're	O
not	O
very	O
heavy	O
see	O
so	O
you	O
carry	O
them	O
with	O
you	O

and	O
they	O
'll	O
keep	O
you	O
dry	O
or	O
whatever	O

um-hum	O

ye-	O
yes	O

in	O
fact	O
uh	O
um	O
last	O
month	O
we	O
went	O
camping	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
deer	O
uh	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
just	O
deer	O
everywhere	O

uh	O

so	O
uh	O
but	O
it	O
even	O
though	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
hunting	O
season	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
with	O
boy	O
scouts	O

so	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
uh	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
hunting	O

but	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
deer	O
um	O
out	O
and	O
about	O

and	O
there	O
's	O

of	O
course	O
we	O
see	O
smaller	O
animals	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
uh	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
big	O
concern	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
at	O
night	O
uh	O
is	O
uh	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
food	O
's	O
put	O
away	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O
because	O
uh	O
we	O
have	O
uh	O
armadillos	O

do	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
a	O
armadillo	O
is	O

um-hum	O

and	O
possums	O
and	O
uh	O
raccoons	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
have	O
those	O
uh	O
creatures	O
down	O
here	O
that	O
they	O
like	O
to	O
uh	O
they	O
like	O
to	O
go	O
hunting	O
for	O
a	O
a	O
midnight	O
snack	O

and	O
so	O
that	O
that	O
uh	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
problem	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
put	O
all	O
your	O
equipment	O
away	O

they	O
will	O
if	O
you	O
attack	O
them	O

but	O
most	O
time	O
they	O
run	O
away	O
from	O
you	O
if	O
y-	O
if	O
they	O
s-	O
if	O
they	O
see	O
you	O
're	O
up	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
problem	O
walking	O
right	O
by	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
asleep	O

so	O

okay	O

should	O
begin	O

uh	O
i	O
can	O
begin	O
this	O
um	O

basically	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
honeywell	O
in	O
minneapolis	O
and	O
the	O
the	O
benefit	O
program	O
we	O
have	O
here	O
is	O
really	O
quite	O
good	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
pretty	O
pleased	O
with	O
it	O

they	O
cover	O
uh	O
just	O
about	O
everything	O
vision	O
dental	O
medical	O
uh	O
you	O
name	O
it	O

and	O
for	O
me	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
job	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
where	O
they	O
've	O
covered	O
that	O
much	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
pretty	O
satisfied	O
myself	O

um	O
what	O
's	O
your	O
situation	O

oh	O

um-hum	O

are	O
you	O
a	O
professor	O
there	O

oh	O
i	O
see	O

okay	O

oh	O
no	O
doubt	O

right	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
would	O
change	O
about	O
honeywell	O
is	O
uh	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
army	O
research	O
institute	O

and	O
being	O
a	O
uh	O
a	O
government	O
organization	O
you	O
got	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
holidays	O
off	O

but	O
here	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
that	O

you	O
maybe	O
get	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
a	O
year	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
really	O

unless	O
you	O
unless	O
you	O
have	O
some	O
vacation	O
time	O
or	O
some	O
some	O
sick	O
leave	O
or	O
whatever	O
um	O
you	O
kind	O
of	O
have	O
to	O
finagle	O
your	O
way	O
around	O
to	O
get	O
that	O
time	O

so	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
a	O
drawback	O
i	O
think	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
consider	O
most	O
important	O
you	O
think	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
of	O
the	O
different	O
benefits	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
saw	O
on	O
twenty	O
twenty	O
the	O
other	O
night	O

they	O
uh	O
they	O
basically	O
reviewed	O
oregon	O
's	O
plan	O
or	O
the	O
oregon	O
plan	O
toward	O
uh	O
nationalizing	O
health	O
care	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
interesting	O
plan	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
cold	O
though	O

they	O
've	O
essentially	O
made	O
up	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
uh	O
oh	O
all	O
the	O
different	O
uh	O
med-	O
medical	O
maladies	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
and	O
they	O
basically	O
made	O
a	O
cutoff	O

about	O
six	O
hundred	O
and	O
eighty	O
seven	O
and	O
below	O
will	O
not	O
be	O

by	O
by	O
uh	O

and	O
and	O
the	O
ones	O

so	O
it	O

you	O

it	O

an	O

you	O

mind	O

dental	O
you	O

uh	O
sometimes	O

just	O
about	O

if	O

in	O
in	O
some	O

uh	O
you	O

the	O
uh	O
the	O
the	O

uh	O

the	O
uh	O
the	O
uh	O
very	O

we	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
the	O
the	O
health	O
care	O
of	O
course	O
is	O
is	O
an	O
important	O
in	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
single	O
most	O
important	O
benefit	O
and	O
uh	O
the	O
rates	O
that	O
we	O
keep	O
paying	O
seem	O
to	O
keep	O
increasing	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
'm	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
little	O
disturbed	O
about	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
national	O
trend	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
solution	O
is	O
to	O
it	O

it	O
's	O
bigger	O
than	O
just	O
the	O

part	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

oh	O
yeah	O

um-hum	O

huh	O
uh-huh	O

hum	O

right	O

right	O
um-hum	O

well	O
we	O
have	O
two	O
different	O
plans	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
subscribe	O
to	O
under	O
dental	O
uh	O
depending	O

and	O
and	O
the	O
cost	O
between	O
them	O
is	O
very	O
is	O
very	O
little	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
costs	O
me	O
something	O
like	O
five	O
dollars	O
a	O
a	O
month	O
for	O
the	O
dental	O
plan	O

but	O
it	O
pays	O
uh	O
a	O
substantial	O
amount	O

i	O
mean	O
the	O
examinations	O
and	O
and	O
uh	O
checkups	O
every	O
year	O
or	O
every	O
six	O
months	O
are	O
free	O
and	O
uh	O
it	O
it	O
covers	O
the	O
bulk	O
of	O
the	O
dental	O
expenses	O

uh	O
yes	O

it	O
is	O

the	O
the	O
benefits	O
plan	O
is	O
different	O
for	O
operat-	O
for	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
operating	O
staff	O
which	O
are	O
considered	O
to	O
be	O
uh	O
clerical	O
personnel	O
accountants	O
things	O

that	O
as	O
opposed	O
to	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
the	O
p.	O
a.	O
t.	O
staff	O
which	O
i	O
belong	O
to	O
and	O
but	O
the	O
main	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
hea-	O
the	O
health	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
dental	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
for	O
everybody	O
and	BE_IP
the	C
retirement	O
plan	O

but	O
the	O
main	O
difference	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
uh	O
the	O
way	O
sick	O
time	O
is	O
accrued	O
and	O
and	O
vacation	O
time	O
is	O
accrued	O

uh	O
for	O
the	O
operating	O
staff	O
it	O
's	O
on	O
a	O
seniority	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
based	O
on	O
how	O
long	O
they	O
've	O
worked	O
there	O

uh	O
that	O
determines	O
how	O
much	O
uh	O
vacation	O

they	O
get	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

college	O

uh	O

i	O
a.	O
a.	O
uh	O
c.	O
r.	O
e.	O
f.	O
uh	O
retirement	O
fund	O

right	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
university	O
of	O
new	O
hampshire	O
uh	O

okay	O
karen	O

you	BE
're	IP
you	C
're	C
first	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
differences	O
i	O
see	O
is	O
uh	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
university	O
uh	O
there	O
is	O
room	O
for	O
advancement	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
so	O
our	O
in	O
uh	O
quite	O
a	O
highly	O
unionized	O
environment	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
in	O
an	O
in	O
administrative	O
association	O

so	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
progressive	O
path	O

but	O
not	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
say	O
the	O
commercial	O
sector	O
the	O
motivation	O
is	O
n't	O
there	O
for	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
uh	O
like	O
really	O

yeah	O

somewhat	O
that	O

but	O
then	O
also	O
there	O
just	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
have	O
uh	O
a	O
broader	O
scope	O
for	O
rewarding	O
people	O
for	O
uh	O
their	O
performances	O

um	O
so	O
that	O
's	O
in	O
in	O
our	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
're	O
dealing	O
with	O
an	O
institution	O

uh	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
difficult	O
to	O
recognize	O
an	O
individual	O
's	O
performance	O
and	O
i	O
suppose	O
that	O
's	O
maybe	O
a	O
disadvantage	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
larger	O
institution	O
perhaps	O
somewhat	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
business	O
uh	O

but	O
i	O
agree	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
uh	O
medical	O
benefits	O
and	O
those	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O
are	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
big	O
pluses	O
for	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
organization	O
and	O
also	O
the	O
uh	O
security	O
aspect	O
for	O
long	O
term	O
employment	O
uh	O

job	O
security	O

yes	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh	O
we	O
're	O
seeing	O
that	O
here	O
as	O
well	O

like	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
oil	O
companies	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
massive	O
layoffs	O

uh	O
so	BE
i	IP
i	C
think	C
there	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
major	O
distinction	O
between	O
institutions	O
and	O
the	O
corporate	O
world	O
in	O
uh	O
institutions	O
are	O
slower	O
to	O
react	O
both	O
on	O
the	O
growth	O
side	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
on	O
the	O
reduction	O
side	O
where	O
the	O
businesses	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
cut	O
back	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
we	O
do	O

but	O

yeah	O

and	O
institutionally	O
like	O
here	O
at	O
the	O
university	O
oh	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
cut	O
back	O
well	O
gee	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
where	O
it	O
necessarily	O
is	O
needed	O

it	O
's	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
most	O
expedient	O
which	O
well	O
in	O
one	O
s-	O
sense	O
for	O
us	O
it	O
's	O
where	O
it	O

the	O
least	O
noise	O
which	O
means	O
it	O
's	O
often	O
the	O
lowest	O
support	O
type	O
roles	O

so	O
we	O

end	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
easy	O

yeah	O

right	O

because	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
the	O
support	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
providing	O
the	O
speed	O
for	O
it	O

well	O
the	O
uh	O

uh	O
th-	O
that	O
's	O
maybe	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
importance	O
i	O
guess	O

uh	O
yeah	O

because	O
my	O
perspective	O
is	O
from	O
an	O
institution	O

uh	O
the	BE_IP
there	C
is	O
not	O
much	O
incentive	O
for	O
innovativeness	O
because	O
the	O
the	O
limitation	O
for	O
reward	O
is	O
is	O
very	O
severe	O
but	O
if	O
you	BE
're	IP
in	C
the	C
corporate	O
world	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
is	O
considerable	O
motivation	O
for	O
uh	O
i	O
guess	O
in	O
innovation	O

although	O
he	BE_IP
the	C
you	O
know	O
the	O
more	O
complex	O
your	O
structure	O
the	O
uh	O
less	O
difficult	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
carry	O
some	O
things	O
through	O
but	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
is	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
long	O
term	O
type	O
of	O
process	O
where	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
organization	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
things	O
can	O
happen	O
much	O
more	O
quickly	O

and	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
the	O
reward	O
of	O
your	O
efforts	O

right	O

yeah	O

you	O
end	O
up	O
being	O
your	O
own	O
person	O
and	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
job	O
fine	O
and	O
if	O
somebody	O
else	O
is	O
messing	O
it	O
up	O
well	O
then	O
that	O
's	O
their	O
problem	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
really	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
becomes	O
the	O
organization	O
instead	O
of	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

themselves	O

oh	O
okay	O

i	O
was	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
say	O
i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
thing	O
for	O
me	O
is	O
like	O
the	O
room	O
for	O
advancement	O
you	O
know	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
like	O
in	O
a	O
dead	O
end	O
job	O

and	O
plus	O
for	O
me	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
i	O
mean	O
like	O
medical	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O
benefits	O
and	O
dental	O

they	O
're	O
also	O
important	O

um	O

um	O

are	O
they	O

we-	O
pretty	O
much	O
trained	O
for	O
a	O

and	O
that	O
what	O
's	O
their	O
hired	O
for	O
and	O
then	O
uh	O
j-	O
just	O
very	O
little	O
variation	O
from	O
there	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
though	O

because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
's	O
necessarily	O
the	O
case	O
anymore	O

i	O
use	O
to	O

that	O
you	O

after	O
you	O

you	O

um	O
that	O
use	O
to	O
be	O
i	O

a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
anymore	O

in	O

they	O
we	O
just	O
had	O
a	O
lay	O
off	O
in	O
what	O
november	O
i	O
guess	O

but	O
um	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
necessarily	O

i	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
some	O
people	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
no	O

yeah	O

expedi-	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
exactly	O
it	O

yeah	O

where	O
the	O

what	O
it	O
where	O
it	O
you	O

oh	O

oh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
too	O

you	O
get	O
too	O
many	O
management	O
people	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
easy	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
say	O
oh	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
when	O
they	O
really	O
are	O
n't	O
aware	O
of	O
what	O
all	O
it	O
took	O
to	O
get	O
the	O

you	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
wonder	O
why	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
done	O
in	O
the	O

when	O
those	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

so	O
what	O
else	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
is	O
important	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

i	O

i	O

it	O

you	O

probably	O
where	O
as	O
in	O
a	O

sometimes	O
i	O

you	O

you	O

you	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

whereas	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

that	O
really	O

i	O

you	O

that	O
a	O

uh	O
i	O

the	O

you	O
you	O
you	O
you	O
you	O

i	O
it	BE

as	O
we	O

um-hum	O

and	O
they	O

uh	O
even	O

on	O

i	O
i	BE
'd	IE

my	O

that	O

uh	O
what	O

your	O

you	O

him	O

so	O
he	O

the-	O
you	O
know	O
he	O
's	O
too	O
big	O
for	O

of	O
an	O

or	O
something	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
uh	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
guns	O
should	O
be	O
outlawed	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
stuff	O
that	O

i	O
mean	O
all	O
you	O
do	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
guns	O
and	O
then	O
like	O
with	O
the	O
stuff	O
of	O
that	O
massacre	O
in	O
killeen	O
texas	O
not	O
too	O
long	O
ago	O
but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
i	O
mean	O
unless	O
they	O
do	O
uh	O
just	O
outlaw	O
them	O
how	O
you	O
can	O
uh	O
i	O
mean	O
prevent	O
that	O

yeah	O

that	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
even	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
procedures	O
are	O
now	O

um	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
gun	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
gun	O
especially	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O

yeah	O

huh	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
scary	O

so	O
does	O
now	O
do	O
they	O
want	O
us	O
to	O
say	O
where	O
we	O
feel	O
about	O
it	O
like	O
in	O
rating	O
it	O
one	O
to	O
ten	O

that	O
's	O
where	O
i	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O

well	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
can	O
how	O
they	O
can	O
really	O
enforce	O
the	O
laws	O
any	O
better	O
because	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
need	O
them	O
and	O
like	O
for	O
protection	O
and	O
stuff	O
and	O
i	O
can	O
understand	O
them	O
wanting	O
to	O
have	O
them	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
like	O
all	O
those	O
nutcases	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

well	O
the	O
way	O
they	O

you	O

where	O

used	O
to	O
work	O
we	O
had	O
what	O
we	O
called	O
tree	O
boxes	O

that	O
's	O
just	O
what	O
we	O
called	O
them	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
recycled	O
cardboard	O

they	O
were	O
eight	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
by	O

and	O
you	O
set	O
it	O
by	O
your	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
as	O
you	O
got	O
rid	O
of	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O

you	O
stuck	O
it	O
in	O
there	O

and	O
when	O
it	O

you	O

you	O

whoever	O
to	O
come	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O

and	O
they	O
brought	O
you	O
another	O
box	O

so	O
not	O
only	O
is	O
it	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
more	O
people	O
would	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
use	O
it	O
uh	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
save	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
cleaning	O
service	O
's	O
time	O
and	O

and	O

that	O
we	O

to	O
to	O
empty	O
the	O

and	O
combine	O
it	O
and	O
bundle	O
it	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
now	O
when	O
it	O
could	O
all	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
one	O
step	O
kind	O
of	O
type	O
thing	O

so	O

right	O

but	O

right	O

but	O
somebody	O
still	O
has	O
to	O
collect	O
all	O
that	O
and	O
bundle	O
it	O
together	O

and	O
whereas	O
if	O
you	O
had	O
a	O
box	O
that	O
was	O
preset	O
and	O
it	O
got	O
full	O
you	O
closed	O
the	O
box	O
it	O
's	O
already	O
bundled	O

it	O
's	O
already	O

for	O
you	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
saving	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
effort	O

i	O
just	O
need	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
paper	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
somebody	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
feasible	O

so	O
um	O
what	O
else	O
do	O
they	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
dallas	O

uh-huh	O

hm	O

anything	O
extra	O

that	O
sounds	O
good	O

there	O
's	O

i	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
wanting	O
to	O
put	O

two	O
of	O
three	O

right	O
out	O
my	O

where	O
you	O

from	O
the	O

where	O
you	O

you	O
can	O
throw	O

in	O
one	O
or	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

or	O
the	O
uh	O
even	O
uh	O

there	O
are	O

that	O

the	O
the	O
tin	O
cans	O

your	O
you	O
know	O
vegetable	O
things	O
come	O
in	O

and	O
um	O
so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
not	O

that	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
what	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
so	O
because	O
we	O
do	O
go	O
through	O
aluminum	O
cans	O
you	O
know	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
the	O
one	O
we	O
use	O
most	O

uh	O
but	O

find	O
a	O

well	O
um	O
uh	O
they	O
they	O
do	O
have	O

for	O

the	O

those	O
are	O
the	O
two	O

oil	O
like	O
car	O
oil	O
recycled	O
oil	O
to	O

they	O
have	O
uh	O
dump	O
areas	O
like	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
departments	O
throughout	O
town	O

um	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
yet	O
have	O
the	O
facilities	O
here	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
tin	O
cans	O

uh	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
the	O
plastics	O
like	O
the	O
liter	O
bottles	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

um	O
but	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
know	O
for	O
sure	O
though	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
newspaper	O
and	O
the	O
aluminum	O
can	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
oil	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
departments	O

so	O

i	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
people	O
are	O
becoming	O
more	O
aware	O
you	O
know	O
of	O
of	O
the	O
waste	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
like	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
know	O

y-	O
you	O
drive	O
through	O
burger	O
king	O
now	O

and	O
the	O
bags	O
are	O
recycled	O
paper	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
feel	O
like	O
people	O
are	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O
or	O
becoming	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
like	O
maybe	O
it	O
's	O
making	O
an	O
impact	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
about	O
searching	O
something	O
out	O
like	O
that	O
but	O
if	O
i	O
'm	O
there	O
and	O
the	O
choice	O
is	O
there	O
i	O
would	O
probably	O
take	O
the	O
recycled	O
product	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
where	O
i	O
probably	O
need	BE
to	IP
be	C
a	C
little	O
more	O
responsible	O
as	O
a	O
citizen	O
wise	O
you	O
know	O
looking	O
or	O
searching	O
those	O
out	O
because	O
you	O
figure	O
if	O
we	O
as	O
the	O
citizens	O
do	O
that	O
then	O
the	O
manufactures	O
and	O
producers	O
will	O
start	O
packaging	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

so	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
getting	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
styro-	O

okay	O

so	O
frank	O
what	O
uh	O
type	O
of	O
uh	O
budget	O
do	O
you	O
or	O
your	O
family	O
have	O

right	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
sounds	O
like	O
uh	O
probably	O
a	O
tighter	O
controlled	O
budget	O
than	O
what	O
i	O
have	O

i	O
'm	O
single	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
excuse	O
for	O
not	O
having	O
a	O
tight	O
budget	O

but	O
i	O
basically	O

right	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O

i	O
'm	O
the	O
only	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
track	O
of	O

so	O
it	O
makes	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
easier	O

um	O
and	O
also	O
i	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
try	O
to	O
save	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
each	O
month	O
as	O
well	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
have	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
what	O
my	O
expenses	O
are	O

and	BE
i	IP
i	C
'm	C
pretty	O
consistent	O
from	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
and	O
uh	O
whenever	O
i	O
need	O
to	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
whenever	O
that	O
changes	O
i	O
'm	O
pretty	O
well	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O
without	O
actually	O
having	O
to	O
maintain	O
a	O
budget	O
for	O
it	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

right	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
do	O
a	O
similar	O
thing	O
more	O
m-	O
uh	O
medium	O
or	O
longer	O
range	O

i	O
just	O
have	O
a	O
maybe	O
a	O
target	O
amount	O
that	O
i	O
'll	O
save	O
for	O

like	O
i	O
'm	O

probably	O
within	O
a	O
year	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
new	O
car	O

so	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
have	O
uh	O
an	O
amount	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
making	O
every	O
effort	O
to	O
to	O
put	O
a	O
little	O

away	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
increase	O
the	O
amount	O
i	O
need	O
for	O
a	O
down	O
payment	O
or	O
whatever	O

right	O

um-hum	O

hm	O
right	O

right	O

have	O
you	O
thought	O
about	O
uh	O
leasing	O

i	O
see	O

right	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
rolling	O
it	O
over	O
every	O
three	O
years	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
advantageous	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
typically	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
purchase	O
your	O
own	O
car	O
you	O
tend	O
to	O
make	O
uh	O
the	O
best	O
returns	O
after	O
you	O
pay	O
it	O
off	O

of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
longer	O
you	O
keep	O
it	O
beyond	O
that	O
point	O
the	O
more	O
profitable	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
own	O
it	O
yourself	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

yeah	O

mine	O
's	O
uh	O
seven	O
years	O
old	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
last	O
year	O
was	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
rough	O
year	O
for	O
it	O

i	O
had	O
ex-	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
expenses	O

but	O
uh	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
hoping	O
that	O
m-	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
the	O

as	BE
you	IP
get	C
to	C
a	C
certain	O
number	O

miles	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
everything	O
replaced	O
brake	O

and	O
all	O
that	O

so	O
i	O
just	O
went	O
through	O
that	O
whole	O
set	O
last	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O

i	O

be	O

a	O

period	O
before	O
i	O

that	O
again	O

right	O

right	O

what	O
line	O
of	O
work	O
are	O
you	O
in	O

well	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
we	O
really	O

a	O

a	O

that	O
i	O
that	O
i	O

actually	O

actually	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
a	O
way	O

uh	O
we	O

uh	O
my	O

right	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

well	O
i	O
found	O
that	O
uh	O
you	O

thing-	O
as	O
as	O
i	O
've	O
gotten	O
older	O

i	O
'm	O
in	O
my	O

before	O
we	O

v-	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
strict	O
budget	O

i	O
had	O
four	O
kids	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
we	O
planned	O
out	O
how	O

we	O

how	O

of	O
anticipate	O
how	O
much	O
things	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
guess	O
one	O
interesting	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
budgeting	O
i	O
do	O
now	O
is	O
that	O
i	O
set	O

uh	O

kind	O
of	O
fence	O
off	O

of	O
my	O

for	O

there	O

uh	O
every	O
six	O
months	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
my	O
taxes	O

so	O
i	O
take	O
a	O
set	O
amount	O

i	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
money	O
market	O
account	O
that	BE
i	IP

a	C

in	O

and	O
i	O
also	O
have	O
got	O
a	O

that	O

what	O
i	O
do	O
on	O
my	O
money	O

for	O
my	O

for	O

uh	O
an	O

of	O
two	O

twenty	O
dollars	O
a	O

i	O
'll	O
just	O
take	O
two	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty	O
out	O

and	O
i	O
put	O
it	O
in	O

i	O

every	O

to	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
when	O
the	O

bill	O
comes	O
in	O
i	O
've	O
got	O
that	O
much	O
set	O
aside	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
budgeting	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh	O
cars	O
are	O
are	O
definitely	O
something	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
figure	O
into	O
your	O
budget	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
buying	O
them	O
but	O
for	O
for	O
keeping	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
too	O

um	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
two	O
cars	O

my	O
wife	O
has	O
a	O
car	O

and	O
i	O
and	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
drive	O
a	O
pick	O
up	O
truck	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
on	O
a	O
schedule	O
where	O
i	O
try	O
every	O
uh	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
years	O
to	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
new	O
one	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
'm	O
constantly	O
making	O
car	O
payments	O

but	O
i	O
figure	O
that	O
's	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
anyway	O
is	O
making	O
car	O
payments	O

so	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
get	O
one	O
paid	O
for	O

and	O
uh	O
actually	O
i	O
'm	O
saving	O
up	O
for	O
another	O
one	O
besides	O

so	O
it	BE_IP
's	C_IE
y-	C_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
it	C_IE
's	C_IP
it	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
a	O
never	O

thing	O

but	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
schedule	O
those	O
things	O
so	O
that	O
uh	O
you	O
're	O
on-	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
paying	O
for	O
two	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
i	O
guess	O
what	O
i	O
'm	O
saying	O

well	O
i	O
've	O
thought	O
about	O
it	O

but	O
leasing	O
would	O
n't	O

i	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
my	O
business	O

my	O
wife	O
uses	O
hers	O
just	O
for	O

and	O
i	O

mine	O
just	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
and	O
forth	O
to	O
work	O
which	O
is	O
only	O
ten	O

i	O

uh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

yeah	O

you	O
're	O
right	O

um	O
i-	O
i	O

them	O
you	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

those	O

was	O
uh	O
a	O
guide	O
for	O
bear	O
and	O
elk	O

out	O

quite	O
a	O
bit	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
what	O
the	O
scale	O
now	O
is	O
it	O
's	O
zero	O
for	O
uh	O
for	O
a	O
complete	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
am	O
about	O
eight	O
or	O
nine	O

yeah	O

no	O
doubt	O
about	O
it	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

if	O
there	O
is	O
if	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
way	O
you	O
know	O
to	O
limit	O
it	O
t-	O
to	O
people	O
that	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

they	O
they	O
i	O
guess	O
they	O
passed	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
uh	O
of	O
laws	O
here	O
while	O
back	O
in	O
some	O
states	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
a	O
waiting	O
period	O
where	O
they	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
hand	O
gun	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
actually	O
uh	O

i	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
this	O
way	O
in	O
florida	O

they	O
have	O
a	O
waiting	O
period	O
where	O
you	O
buy	O
one	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
check	O
you	O
out	O
and	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
record	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
idea	O

uh	O
and	O
that	O
's	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
bad	O
idea	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
you	O
can	O
always	O
get	O
around	O
that	O

you	O
could	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
black	O
market	O
like	O
you	O
say	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
always	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
around	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE
guess	IP
i	C
guess	C
some	O
forms	O
of	O
guns	O
should	O
probably	O
be	O
controlled	O
just	O
like	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
sure	O
why	O
anybody	O
would	O
need	O
a	O
fully	O
automatic	O
weapon	O

you	O

know	O
i	O
'm	O
just	O
not	O

i	O
think	O
those	O
have	O
been	O
pretty	O
much	O
you	O
know	O
banned	O
altogether	O
anyway	O

it	O
kind	O
of	O
takes	O

you	O

that	O
you	O

the	O
other	O
thing	O
that	O
i	O
always	O
notice	O
is	O
that	O
whenever	O
they	O
write	O
about	O
something	O
that	O
i	O
'm	O
an	O
expert	O
in	O
i	O
find	O
their	O
descriptions	O
to	O
be	O
wrong	O
and	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

well	O
even	BE
if	IP
it	C
's	C
not	O
technical	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
um	O
social	O
thing	O
or	O
or	O
whatever	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
matter	O

if	O
i	O
'm	O
expert	O
in	O
it	O
they	O
usually	O
make	O
mistakes	O
which	O
leads	O
me	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
things	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
expert	O
in	O
that	O

they	O
're	O
telling	O
me	O
lies	O

i-	O
i	O
think	O
both	O

uh	O
by	O
deliberate	O
um	O
i	O
mean	O
mist-	O
mistakes	O
of	O
omission	O
or	O
uh	O
or	O
uh	O
bias	O
toward	O
the	O
particular	O
viewpoint	O
particular	O
liberal	O
view	O
point	O
that	O
they	O
have	O

so	O
uh	O
uh	O
well	O
give	O
an	O
example	O
uh	O
y-	O
y-	O
we	O
'll	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
printing	O
media	O

i	O
know	O
of	O
cases	O
where	O
um	O
for	O
example	O
in	O
television	O
media	O
where	O
they	O
'll	O
show	O
clippings	O
from	O
one	O
event	O
and	O
describe	O
another	O
event	O
but	O
with	O
the	O
attempt	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
impression	O
that	BE
what	IP
they	C
're	C
talking	O
about	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
showing	O
you	O
which	O
is	O
sort	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
deliberate	O
bias	O
um	O
which	O
is	O
which	O
is	O
rather	O
disturbing	O

i	O
know	O
a._b._c.	O
does	O
that	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
access	O
either	O
although	O
i	O
did	O
at	O
one	O
time	O

and	O
uh	O
it	O
wa-	O

i	O
did	O
during	O
the	O
gulf	O
war	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
addictive	O

yeah	O

well	O
during	O
that	O
small	O
sample	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
everyone	O
was	O
just	O
about	O
just	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
except	O
the	O
three	O
networks	O
who	O
also	O
had	O
radio	O
then	O
television	O
programming	O

so	O
if	O
at	O
a	O
particular	O
time	O
you	O
wanted	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
latest	O
and	O
greatest	O
news	O
you	O
could	O
do	O
that	O
by	O
um	O
turning	O
on	O
c._n._n.	O

and	O
you	O
w-	O

okay	O
eric	O

um	O
are	O
you	O
married	O

and	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
family	O

okay	O

and	O
do	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
wife	O
have	O
a	O
budget	O
plan	O
for	O
your	O
finances	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O
um	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
basically	O
what	O
we	O
do	O

um	O
about	O
every	O
every	O
three	O
months	O
or	O
so	O
we	O
reevaluate	O
our	O
budget	O

and	O
we	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
just	O
write	O
from	O
the	O
largest	O
bills	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
smallest	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
divvy	O
them	O
up	O
between	O
our	O
four	O
pay	O
checks	O

i	O
work	O
part	O
time	O
at	O
night	O
and	O
he	O
works	O
and	O
my	O
husband	O
works	O
full	O
time	O
days	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
four	O
pay	O
checks	O

with	O
that	O
works	O
out	O
nice	O
because	O
we	O
get	O
paid	O
every	O
week	O

and	O
so	O
that	O
does	O
help	O

that	O
helps	O
a	O
lot	O

and	O
then	O
um	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
ex-	O
extra	O
for	O
extra	O
spending	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
well	O
earmarked	O

yeah	O

ev-	O
every	O
penny	O
is	O
earmarked	O

but	BE_IP
um	C
it	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
that	O
works	O
the	O
best	O

and	O
and	O
so	O
if	O
we	O
can	O
just	O
divide	O
them	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
major	O
bills	O
up	O

in	O
fact	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
easier	O
to	O
divide	O
the	O
major	O
bills	O
up	O
you	O
know	O
cut	O
the	O
house	O
payment	O
in	O
half	O
and	O
cut	O
the	O
loan	O
payment	O
in	O
half	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
divide	O
those	O
up	O
between	O
all	O

um-hum	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
taking	O
a	O
huge	O
sum	O
out	O
out	O
of	O
one	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
next	O
pay	O
check	O
we	O
're	O
real	O
short	O

or	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
helps	O
you	O
to	O
focus	O
where	O
your	O
money	O
goes	O
and	O
and	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
you	O
felt	O
the	O
s-	O
the	O
same	O
frustration	O
before	O
you	O
got	O
on	O
a	O
budget	O

but	O
you	O
're	O
wondering	O
my	O
when	O
you	O
put	O
down	O
all	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
bring	O
in	O

and	BE_IP
then	C
you	O
're	O
saying	O
my	O
word	O
where	O
did	O
all	O
that	O
money	O
go	O

where	O
does	O
it	O
go	O

huh	O
and	O
also	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
write	O
down	O

a-	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
this	O

we	O
're	O
not	O
real	O
consistent	O
with	O
this	O

but	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
month	O

and	O
we	O
wrote	O
down	O
everything	O
that	O
we	O
bought	O
with	O
you	O
know	O
every	O
paycheck	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
where	O
every	O
penny	O
went	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
just	O
what	O
you	O
do	O
spend	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
like	O
i	O
say	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
real	O
consistent	O
with	O
it	O

it	O
's	O

we	O
should	O
because	O
it	O
does	O
help	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

just	O
stick	O
to	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
is	O

uh-huh	O
yeah	O

that	O
that	O
sounds	O
like	O
a	O
really	O
good	O
idea	O

and	O
it	O
really	O
helpful	O

um	BE_IP
have	C
you	O
developed	O
a	O
savings	O
plan	O
or	O
i._r._a.s	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O
yet	O

oh	O
uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
feeling	O

my	O
husband	O
just	O
graduated	O
from	O
the	O
university	O
uh	O
a	O
year	O
ago	O
so	O
finally	O
finally	O
we	O
are	O
getting	O
to	O
that	O
point	O
too	O

so	BE_IP
are	C
you	O
still	O
going	O
to	O
school	O

or	O

uh	O
yes	O
i	O
am	O
to	O
uh	O
both	O
questions	O

uh	O
yeah	O

we	O
do	O

we	O
um	O
uh	O

basically	O
there	O
's	O
the	O
you	O
know	O
expenses	O
that	O
are	O
fixed	O
during	O
the	O
month	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
come	O
every	O
every	O
month	O

and	BE_IP
we	C
uh	O
enter	O
those	O
into	O
uh	O
into	O
a	O
spread	O
sheet	O

and	O
uh	O
what	O
's	O
ever	O
left	O
uh	O
after	O
that	O
we	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
we	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
agree	O
on	O
kind	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
range	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
generally	O
going	O
to	O
shoot	O
for	O

so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O

um-hum	O

wow	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

all	O
allocated	O
out	O

yeah	O

all	O
the	O
checks	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

we	O
found	O
that	O
um	O
it	O
's	O
definitely	O
helped	O
uh	O
get	O
a	O
handle	O
on	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
unnecessary	O
expenses	O

we	O
were	O
before	O
we	O
started	O
doing	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
thing	O
we	O
were	O
um	O
spending	O
uh	O
money	O
for	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

we	O
probably	O
tended	O
to	O
eat	O
out	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
than	O
we	O
should	O
have	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
uh	O
let	O
things	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
hand	O

we	O
thought	O
it	O
uh	O
thought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
really	O
helpful	O

we	O
've	O
gotten	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
loans	O
paid	O
off	O
early	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
and	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

so	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O

but	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

the	O
other	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
that	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
found	O
that	O
that	O
helps	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
tend	O
to	O
fudge	O
on	O
the	O
budget	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
to	O
uh	O
uh	O
get	O
out	O
the	O
money	O
in	O
advance	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
uh	O
um	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
unreasonably	O
high	O
but	O
for	O
things	O
like	O
food	O
expenses	O
or	O
or	O
whatever	O
just	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
in	O
an	O
envelope	O
or	O
whatever	O

and	O
that	O
way	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
forced	O
us	O
to	O
uh	O
stick	O
to	O
that	O
amount	O
and	O
then	O
once	O
that	O
was	O
gone	O
well	O
if	O
the	O
entertainment	O
amount	O
was	O
gone	O
for	O
the	O
month	O
oh	O
it	O
's	O
gone	O

so	O

we	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O

we	O
our	O
our	O
initial	O
goal	O
was	O
just	O
to	O
retire	O
our	O
debt	O
uh	O
completely	O
retire	O
our	O
debt	O
for	O
car	O
payments	O
and	BE_IP
credit	C

uh	O
credit	O
card	O
debt	O
and	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
that	O

and	O
we	O
're	O
just	O
at	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
start	O
thinking	O
about	O
it	O

're	C
still	O
together	O

they	O
're	O
still	O
making	O
albums	O

um-hum	O

uh	O

in	O
fact	O
i	O
mean	O
there	O
are	O
people	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
basically	O
just	O
follow	O
them	O
around	O
from	O
city	O
to	O
city	O
on	O
tour	O
selling	O
tie	O
dyes	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

um	O

yeah	O

they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
like	O
late	O
forties	O
early	O
fifties	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
whenever	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
dies	O
off	O
they	O
get	O
a	O
replacement	O

they	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
really	O
bad	O
time	O
with	O
keyboard	O
players	O

they	O
keep	O
on	O
dying	O

and	O
they	O
keep	O
on	O
replacing	O
them	O

and	O
the	O
new	O
ones	O
in	O
his	O
thirties	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

well	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
actually	O
look	O
as	O
rough	O
as	O
the	O
rolling	O
stones	O

i	O
just	O

i-	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
saw	O
the	O
tour	O
posters	O
for	O
the	O
rolling	O
stones	O
when	O
they	O
last	O
toured	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
it	O
looked	O
like	O
leather	O
day	O
at	O
the	O
geriatric	O

all	O
their	O
faces	O
were	O
just	O
all	O
shriveled	O

and	O
um-hum	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
jus-	O
just	O
looked	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
got	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
retirees	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
leather	O
jackets	O
and	O
blue	O
jeans	O

well	O
uh	O

i	O
prefer	O
my	O
my	O
performers	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
sober	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
uh	O
just	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
jamming	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
just	O
lose	O
themselves	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
go	O
into	O
la	O
la	O
land	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

so	O
um	O
have	O
you	O
seen	O
any	O
concerts	O
lately	O

um	O
lots	O
of	O
different	O
kinds	O
i	O
guess	O

hm	O

hello	O
ann	O

um	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
i	O
attended	O
a	O
conference	O
here	O
at	O
utah	O
state	O
university	O
on	O
recycling	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interested	O
to	O
hear	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
people	O
from	O
the	O
e._p._a.	O
and	O
lots	O
of	O
different	O
places	O
and	O
uh	O
they	O
had	O
basically	O
decided	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
real	O
problem	O
here	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
on	O
solid	O
waste	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
too	O
new	O

oh	O
they	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
propose	O
any	O
solutions	O

actually	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
guy	O
was	O
pretty	O
negative	O
about	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
was	O
doing	O
even	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
from	O
the	O
e._p._a.	O

but	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
uh	O
facts	O
to	O
to	O
give	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
how	O
many	O
solid	O
waste	O
plants	O
were	O
being	O
shut	O
down	O

and	O
and	O
uh	O
uh	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
things	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
was	O
recycling	O
of	O
of	O
news	O
print	O

and	O
he	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
um	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
new	O
york	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
went	O
and	O
collected	O
all	O
this	O
news	O
print	O
and	O
they	O
could	O
sell	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
while	O

they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
sell	O
it	O
for	O
some	O
amount	O
per	O
ton	O

and	O
now	O
at	BE_IP
this	C
stage	O
of	O
the	O
game	O
where	O
they	O
have	O
gotten	O
into	O
recycling	O
they	O
've	O
collected	O
so	O
much	O
news	O
print	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
hauled	O
away	O

yeah	O

we	O
're	O
doing	O
some	O
here	O
in	O
in	O
cash	O
valley	O
the	O
community	O
here	O

there	O
's	O
uh	O
we	O
've	O
actually	O
got	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
nice	O
set	O
up	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
plants	O
here	O
that	O
actually	O
take	O
uh	O
recycled	O
paper	O
and	O
shred	O
it	O
and	O
spray	O
it	O
with	O
chemical	O
treatment	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
fire	O
hazard	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
into	O
insulation	O

and	O
they	O
can	O
actually	O
use	O
as	O
much	O
recycled	O
paper	O
as	O
the	O
community	O
can	O
get	O
to	O
them	O
because	O
they	O
're	O
actually	O
buying	O
it	O
and	O
shipping	O
it	O
in	O
from	O
outside	O

so	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
real	O
keys	O
it	O
sounds	O
like	O
to	O
getting	O
recycling	O
for	O
uh	O
paper	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
to	O
go	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
business	O
to	O
actually	O
want	O
it	O
once	O
you	O
've	O
collected	O
it	O

um-hum	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
paper	O
presented	O
at	O
this	O
conference	O
from	O
a	O
guy	O
from	O
alabama	O

and	BE_IP
he	C
was	O
kind	O
of	O
hired	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
study	O
by	O
two	O
departments	O
for	O
the	O
government	O

one	O
was	O
like	O
environmental	O
protection	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
one	O
was	O
oh	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
remember	O
what	O

but	O
the	O
basic	O
idea	O
it	O
was	O
presented	O
to	O
him	O
was	O
how	O
can	O
we	O
maximize	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
energy	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
get	O
back	O
from	O
recycling	O
and	O
minimize	O
the	O
volume	O
of	O
stuff	O
we	O
are	O
putting	O
into	O
our	O
landfill	O
and	O
uh	O
the	O
solution	O
that	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
for	O
plastics	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
quite	O
amazing	O

because	O
he	O
says	O
well	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
plastics	O
is	O
to	O
burn	O
them	O

he	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
plastics	O
is	O
actually	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
problems	O
in	O
landfills	O
cause	O
it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
low	O
weight	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
high	O
volume	O
so	O
it	O
takes	O
up	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
space	O
and	O
there	O
's	O
almost	O
no	O
energy	O
there	O
's	O
very	O
little	O
energy	O
value	O
in	O
actually	O
doing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
recycling	O

but	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
energy	O
in	O
it	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
burn	O
it	O
and	O
use	O
it	O
to	O
produce	O
electricity	O

so	O
his	O
solution	O
was	O
to	O
burn	O
plastic	O
collect	O
it	O
and	O
burn	O
it	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
than	O
even	O
paper	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

there	O
's	O
more	O
energy	O
in	O
it	O
per	O
pound	O
or	O
whatever	O

well	O
that	O
was	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
deal	O
with	O
that	O

he	O
just	O
said	O
burn	O
it	O

he	O
did	O
n't	O
talk	O
about	O
cleaning	O
it	O
up	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
very	O
practical	O

is	O
it	O
yeah	O

well	O
real	O
interest-	O

um	O
not	O
too	O
much	O

i	O
'm	O
uh	O
i	O
got	O
a	O
bit	O

actuall-	O

hello	O
chuck	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
new	O
revelation	O

right	O

so	O
what	O
what	O
i-	O
is	O
the	O
e._p._a.	O
recommending	O
now	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

why	O

that	BE
's	IE
a	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
common	O
problem	O
now	O

that	O
seems	O
that	O
has	O
happened	O
in	O
dallas	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
new	O
york	O

and	O
i	O
try	O
to	O
recycle	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
newspapers	O
that	O
come	O
to	O
my	O
house	O

and	O
after	O
a	O
while	O
i	O
just	O
quit	O
taking	O
the	O
newspaper	O
because	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
recycle	O
it	O
anymore	O
which	O
is	O
n't	O
good	O
for	O
business	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
either	O
i	O
suppose	O

um-hum	O

right	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

right	O

there	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
a	O
reuse	O
for	O
it	O

i	O
mean	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
they	O
recycle	O

the	O
one	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
recycled	O
bottles	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
uh	O
the	O
industry	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
with	O
the	O
recycled	O
polymers	O
uh	O
everything	O
from	O
uh	O
waste	O
baskets	O
to	O
carpet	O
to	O
the	O
no	O
stick	O
i	O
mean	O
the	O
sticky	O
slide	O
rugs	O
under	O
the	O
carpet	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
even	O
putting	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
roadways	O
these	O
days	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
making	O
clothes	O
now	O
that	O
are	O
recycled	O

like	O
the	O
recycled	O
plastic	O
coke	O
bottles	O
and	O
and	O
milk	O
cartons	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
really	O

right	O

huh	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
carbon	O

so	O
that	O
makes	O
sense	O

like	O
a	O
carbon	O
fuel	O
of	O
some	O
sort	O

but	O
what	O
what	O
about	O
emissions	O

oh	O

okay	O

no	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

i	O
bet	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
day	O
at	O
the	O
uh	O
conference	O
then	O

did	O
it	O
change	O
anything	O
for	O
you	O

-ay	O

i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
exercise	O
huh	O

oh	O
i	O
am	O
twenty	O
seven	O

you	O

or	O
is	O
it	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
that	O
every	O
day	O

oh	O
okay	O

oh	O

well	O
see	O
that	O
's	O
that	O
's	O
that	O
's	O
really	O
good	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
keeps	O
a	O
lot	O
some	O
people	O
from	O
exercising	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
weight	O
either	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
because	O
i	O
exercise	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
mean	O
people	O
are	O
always	O
saying	O
to	O
me	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
stay	O
thin	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
because	O
i	O
exercise	O
but	O
i	O
also	O
watch	O
what	O
i	O
eat	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
you	O
'll	O
come	O

b-	O
being	O
twenty	O
seven	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
your	O
heart	O
rate	O
and	O
that	O
yet	O
but	O
as	O
you	O
get	O
older	O
you	O
will	O

well	O
it	O
might	O
not	O

it	O
might	O

n-	O
because	O
everybody	O
's	O
been	O
telling	O
me	O
that	O
too	O

and	O
so	O
far	O
it	O
has	O
n't	O
happened	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
just	O
feel	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
constantly	O
weigh	O
yourself	O
and	O
just	O
keep	O
an	O
eye	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
cut	O
back	O
if	O
it	O
starts	O
to	O
get	O
you	O

too	O
high	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O

any	O

but	O
basketball	O

but	O
do	O
you	O
ski	O

being	O
in	O
utah	O
i	O
was	O
wondering	O
if	O
you	O
skied	O

oh	O
did	O
it	O
really	O

because	O
i	O
know	O
that	O
skiing	O
in	O
utah	O
is	O
is	O
suppose	O
to	O
be	O
great	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
never	O
skied	O
before	O

but	O
i	O
have	O
friends	O
that	O
go	O
to	O
utah	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
they	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
and	O
they	O
ski	O

i	O
guess	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
ski	O

where	O
was	O
it	O
tahoe	O
where	O
you	O
ski	O
from	O

no	O

that	O
's	O
nevada	O
to	O
california	O
i	O
guess	O

yeah	O

i	O
am	O
thinking	O
about	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
ski	O
over	O
the	O
state	O
line	O

but	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
funn-	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
utah	O
called	O
a	O
funny	O
name	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
oh	O
heavenly	O

is	O
that	O
it	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
called	O
heavenly	O

you	O
've	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
that	O

well	O
maybe	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
in	O
utah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
but	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
've	O
skied	O
heavenly	O

and	O
it	O
sounded	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
skied	O
really	O
well	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
actually	O
talking	O
about	O
a	O
place	O

it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
funny	O

oh	O
yeah	O

you	O
can	O
get	O
really	O
sore	O

i	O
know	O
you	O

i	BE
c-	IE
mean	IP
i	C
've	C
talked	O
to	O
people	O

but	O
most	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
ski	O
enough	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
sore	O

and	O
and	O
then	O
is	O
it	O
you-	O
your	O
quadriceps	O
that	O
are	O
this	O
worst	O

you	O
mean	O
your	O
legs	O
and	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
strange	O
that	O
like	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
like	O
i	O
did	O
aerobics	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
went	O
horseback	O
riding	O

and	O
still	O
i	O
was	O
so	O
sore	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
get	O
over	O

um-hum	O

well	O
here	O
in	O
saskatoon	O
um	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
curb	O
pick	O
up	O
of	O
uh	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
recycled	O
products	O

uh	O
we	O
're	O
in	O
a	O
community	O
of	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
eighty	O
thousand	O
people	O

uh	O
there	O
are	O
areas	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
uh	O

actually	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
the	O
uh	O
handicapped	O
societies	O
type	O
of	O
places	O
where	O
they	O
uh	O
one	O
they	O
do	O
as	O
just	O
a	O
recycling	O
operation	O
and	O
then	O
others	O
they	O
uh	O
collect	O
the	O
paper	O
and	O
ship	O
it	O
to	O
other	O
retailers	O

so	O
uh	O
we	O
're	O
able	O
to	O
uh	O
have	O
drop	O
off	O
bins	O
for	O
news	O
papers	O
and	O
cardboard	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

and	O
then	O
there	O
are	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
uh	O
deposit	O
program	O
on	O
plastic	O
and	O
glass	O
containers	O
well	O
primarily	O
soft	O
drink	O
bottles	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
're	O
able	O
to	O
uh	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
uh	O
rehabilitation	O
centers	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
recycle	O
the	O
containers	O

they	O
refund	O
the	O
deposit	O
which	O
is	O
anywhere	O
from	O
five	O
to	O
fifteen	O
cents	O
a	O
container	O

and	O
then	O

right	O

yeah	O
on	O
the	O
on	O
primarily	O
on	O
soft	O
drink	O
pop	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
and	O
uh	O
so	O
they	O
induce	O
recycling	O
of	O
plastic	O
and	O
glass	O
soft	O
drink	O
containers	O

uh	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
o-	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
scrap	O
metal	O
dealers	O
that	O
will	O
accept	O
tin	O
and	O
aluminum	O
cans	O
as	O
well	O
and	O
and	O
actually	O
the	O
recycler	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
deposit	O
on	O
aluminum	O
pop	O
cans	O
and	O
beer	O
cans	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
recycler	O
uh	O
with	O
the	O
handicapped	O
group	O
will	O
also	O
accept	O
those	O

so	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
fairly	O
fairly	O
extensive	O

but	O
again	O
it	BE
's	IP
uh	C
it	C
's	C
the	O
initiative	O
of	O
the	O
individual	O
person	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
no	O

pick	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
city	O

well	O
actually	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
the	O
opportunity	O
for	O
both	O

generally	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C
handicapped	O
group	O
takes	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O

actually	O
the	O
government	O
has	O
placed	O
a	O
deposit	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
inducement	O
to	O
re-	O
recycle	O
the	O
bottle	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
your	O
money	O
back	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
recycler	O
run	O
by	O
the	O
handicapped	O
society	O
pays	O
back	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
that	O
deposit	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
then	O
then	O
they	O
in	O
turn	O
will	O
get	O
some	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
bottlers	O
and	O
from	O
the	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
do	O
the	O
canning	O
of	O
the	O
pop	O
and	O
the	O
beer	O
as	O
as	O
well	O

um	O
yeah	O

um	BE_IP
i	C
guess	O
partly	O
because	O
of	O
our	O
climate	O

here	O
in	O
saskatoon	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
central	O
c-	O
uh	O

well	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
central	O
canada	O

but	O
central	O
canada	O
tends	O
to	O
be	O
referred	O
more	O
to	O
ontario	O
and	O
quebec	O
but	O
um	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
call	O
them	O
homeless	O
people	O

we	O
certainly	O
have	O
a	O
fair	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
on	O
welfare	O
welfare	O
and	O
unemployment	O
insurance	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

um	O
there	O
's	O
psychological	O
pressure	O
against	O
employing	O
people	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
although	O
um	O
scouts	O
and	O
hockey	O
teams	O
and	O
ball	O
teams	O
those	O
kinds	O
um	O
regularly	O
do	O
bottle	O
drives	O
where	O
they	O
go	O
around	O
in	O
various	O
neighborhoods	O
and	O
collecting	O
the	O
bottles	O
at	O
individual	O
homes	O

they	O
have	O
done	O
it	O
some	O
um	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
actually	O
quite	O
an	O
extensive	O
network	O
of	O
collecting	O
uh	O
newspapers	O

they	O
're	O
actually	O
at	O
virtually	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
shopping	O
centers	O
like	O
the	O
shopping	O
malls	O

there	O
are	O
several	O
containers	O
where	O
the	O
group	O
called	O
cosmopolitan	O
industries	O
collects	O

or	O
people	O
can	O
drop	O
their	O
used	O
newspapers	O
and	O
other	O
papers	O
in	O
the	O
bins	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
bins	O
are	O
collected	O

um	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

hey	O
steve	O

um	O
they	O
just	O
uh	O
they	O
just	O
started	O
a	O
recycling	O
program	O
here	O
i	O
think	O

actually	O
this	O
is	O
my	O
first	O
experience	O
with	O
recycling	O
program	O

but	O
um	O
instead	O
of	O
just	O
like	O
tossing	O
everything	O
away	O
which	O
i	O
always	O
felt	O
bad	O
about	O
um	O
i	O
'm	O
starting	O
to	O
split	O
stu-	O
sp-	O
split	O
stuff	O
off	O

the	O
only	O
disadvantage	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
curb	O

they	O
make	O
me	O
drive	O
it	O
like	O
a	O
mile	O
down	O
the	O
road	O

that	O
's	O
very	O
cool	O

you	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
i	O
i	O
heard	O
about	O
a	O
a	O
similar	O
program	O
in	O
new	O
york	O
city	O
where	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
called	O
like	O
homeless	O
incorporated	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
is	O
employ	O
um	O
homeless	O
i	O
think	O
mostly	O
men	O
but	O
homeless	O
people	O
to	O
uh	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
collect	O
all	O
the	O
recyclable	O
cans	O

and	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
cans	O

there	O
may	O
be	O
bottles	O
as	O
well	O
but	O
like	O
beer	O
cans	O
soda	O
cans	O
and	O
what	O
not	O

and	O
they	O
uh	O
bring	O
them	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
one	O
lo-	O
one	O
centralized	O
location	O
and	O
uh	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
collect	O
the	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
various	O
beer	O
and	O
and	O
soda	O
manufacturers	O
and	O
uh	O
and	O
and	O
get	O
more	O
money	O
to	O
these	O
people	O
that	O
desperately	O
need	O
it	O

yeah	O

do	O
they	O
do	O
it	O
with	O
newspapers	O
as	O
well	O

hm	O

um	O
the	O
question	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
trying	O
to	O
put	O
together	O
a	O
uh	O
long	O
term	O
financial	O
plan	O
and	O
a	O
monthly	O
budget	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
do	O
now	O
is	O
uh	O
put	O
the	O
data	O
into	O
quicken	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
familiar	O
with	O
that	O

um-hum	O

hm	O
i	O
i	O
've	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
reliable	O
way	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
check	O
book	O
balanced	O
actually	O
because	O
what	O
-ill	O
happen	O
is	O
my	O
wife	O
or	O
i	O
'll	O
write	O
a	O
few	O
checks	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
'll	O
uh	O
uh	O
not	O
bother	O
to	O
total	O
it	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
it	O
comes	O
comes	O
in	O
just	O
to	O
do	O
all	O
the	O
arithmetic	O

so	O
it	O
helps	O
with	O
that	O

um	O

uh	O
actually	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
to	O
y-	O
y-	O
uh	O
uh	O
until	O
just	O
recently	O

i	O
guess	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
a	O
daughter	O
who	O
's	O
eighteen	O
months	O
and	O
another	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
way	O

so	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
start	O
doing	O
more	O
of	O
that	O
just	O
for	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
saving	O
for	O
college	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

we	O
tried	O
a	O
way	O
try	O
to	O
put	O
away	O
between	O
two	O
and	O
four	O
thousand	O
a	O
year	O
just	O
for	O
that	O

for	O
um	O
um-hum	O

hm	O

hm	O
sounds	O
good	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
just	O
at	O
the	O
point	O
m-	O
uh	O

my	O
wife	O
worked	O
until	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
family	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
now	O
we	O
're	O
just	O
going	O
on	O
the	O
one	O
income	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
lot	O
more	O
interesting	O
trying	O
to	O

find	O
some	O
extra	O
i	O
think	O
payroll	O
deductions	O
probably	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
we	O
'll	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
um	O
do	O
it	O

just	O
you	O
know	O
kind	O
of	O
enforce	O
the	O
savings	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
'll	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O

hm	O

um	O

that	O
sounds	O
good	O

but	O
uh	O
uh	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
curious	O
what	O
uh	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

oh	O
okay	O

um	O
cincinnati	O
actually	O

i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
wondering	O
if	O
they	O
'd	O
be	O
collecting	O
people	O
with	O
uh	O
the	O
western	O
accents	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
many	O
people	O
are	O
uh	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
involved	O
in	O
this	O

but	O
uh	O
well	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

i	O
'm	O
uh	O
uh	O
um	O
actually	O
uh	O
i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interested	O
if	O
you	O
found	O
out	O
about	O
the	O
study	O
by	O
uh	O
reading	O
telecom	O
digest	O

or	O
was	O
there	O
another	O

oh	O
okay	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
how	O
i	O
got	O
it	O
as	O
well	O

but	O
uh	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

it	O
'll	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
it	O
'd	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
data	O
base	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
the	O
experiment	O

and	O
probably	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
topic	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
finances	O
without	O
without	O
getting	O
to	O
uh	O
dollar	O
figures	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
know	O

we	O
could	O
talk	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
range	O
goals	O

yeah	O

um	O
well	O
i	O
think	O
either	O
my	O
wife	O
or	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
pursue	O
advanced	O
degrees	O
at	O
some	O
point	O
uh	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
'll	O
have	O
to	O
factor	O
that	O
in	O
if	O
we-	O
if	O
we	O
're	O
not	O
working	O
for	O
employers	O
that	O
happen	O
to	O
fund	O
that	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O
every	O
year	O
my	O
employer	O
scales	O
back	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
their	O
tuition	O
reimbursement	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
use	O
to	O
reimburse	O
it	O
a	O
hundred	O
percent	O

and	O
now	O
it	BE
's	IP
uh	C
now	C
it	C
's	C
reimbursement	O
depending	O
on	O
the	O
grade	O
you	O
get	O
in	O
class	O

and	O
uh	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
real	O
shift	O
from	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
uh	O
because	O
we	O
're	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
uh	O
have	O
some	O
friends	O
of	O
mine	O
who	O
use	O
quicken	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
considered	O
using	O
it	O
once	O
myself	O

but	O
i	O
decided	O
that	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
information	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
keeping	O
that	O
up	O
to	O
date	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
gave	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
using	O
quicken	O
at	O
least	O
for	O
now	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
similar	O
problems	O

but	O
uh	O
we	O
just	O
have	O
the	O
one	O
check	O
book	O

and	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
date	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O

and	O
occasionally	O
we	O
'll	O
get	O
behind	O
like	O
you	O
say	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
too	O
too	O
tight	O
if	O
we	O
r-	O
just	O
remember	O
to	O
keep	O
everything	O
up	O
up	O
to	O
date	O
and	O
balanced	O

well	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
handle	O
the	O
the	O
long	O
range	O
or	O
medium	O
range	O
planning	O
on	O
finances	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
know	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
daughter	O
who	O
's	O
ten	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
put	O
much	O
away	O
for	O
her	O
college	O
up	O
to	O
this	O
point	O

but	O
um	O
we	O
're	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
now	O
where	O
our	O
financial	O
income	O
is	O
enough	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
consider	O
putting	O
some	O
away	O
for	O
college	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
starting	O
a	O
regular	O
payroll	O
deduction	O
in	O
the	O
fall	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
i	O
'll	O
be	O
making	O
this	O
summer	O
we	O
'll	O
be	O
putting	O
away	O
for	O
her	O
college	O
fund	O

um-hum	O

just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O

problem	O

we	O

trying	O
to	O
um	O

so	O
far	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
clear	O
credit	O
wise	O

but	O
uh	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
it	O

so	O
not	O
much	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
add	O
to	O
it	O

we	O
're	O
trying	O

think	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
put	O
away	O
some	O
savings	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

but	O

yeah	O

we	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
some	O
day	O

we	O
have	O
this	O
dream	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
long	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
dream	O

we	O
we	O
're	O

we	O
're	O
really	O
happy	O
that	O

we	O
're	O
real	O
scared	O
about	O
incurring	O
it	O
in	O
this	O
um	O

right	O
now	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
stepping	O

what	O
's	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
save	O
what	O
the	O
little	O
bit	O
that	O
we	O
do	O
get	O
you	O
know	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
expenses	O
every	O
month	O

we	O
're	O
missionaries	O
actually	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
um	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
easier	O
once	O
we	O
get	O
overseas	O
cause	O
we	O
have	O
uh	O
like	O
uh	O
uh	O
support	O
quota	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
cheaper	O
to	O
live	O
overseas	O
than	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
live	O
here	O

and	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
switched	O
very	O
easily	O
once	O
you	O
come	O
home	O

so	O

africa	O

nigeria	O

yeah	O

about	O
four	O
years	O

we	O
're	O
career	O

so	O
we	O
we	O
go	O
over	O
seas	O
for	O
four	O
years	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
come	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
year	O

we	O
go	O
over	O
four	O

we	O
come	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
year	O

um	O
we	O
're	O
with	O
wycliffe	O
bible	O
translators	O

so	O

yeah	O

they	O
could	O
very	O
well	O

and	O

um	O
we	O
will	O
be	O

i	O
was	O
over	O
over	O
for	O
four	O
years	O
doing	O
language	O
surveying	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
step	O

you	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
the	O
scout	O
that	O
goes	O
ahead	O
of	O
the	O
team	O
and	O
assesses	O
the	O
need	O

and	O
uh	O
came	O
home	O
and	O
got	O
married	O

and	O
we	O
will	O
go	O
ba-	O
back	O
as	O
translators	O
cause	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
raise	O
a	O
family	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
easier	O
to	O
raise	O
a	O
family	O
as	O
translators	O

well	O
i	O
always	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
translation	O

but	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
i	O
was	O
single	O
and	O
footloose	O
so	O
to	O
speak	O
it	O
's	O
easier	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
really	O
need	O
surveyors	O
cause	O
you	O
could	O
you	O
're	O
free	O
to	O
travel	O
anywhere	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
kids	O
hanging	O
around	O
you	O
and	O
stuff	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
smattering	O
of	O
about	O
ten	O
different	O
ones	O

but	O
there	O
's	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
bilingual	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
because	O
i	O
kept	O
switching	O
from	O
one	O
area	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
you	O
know	O

since	O
i	O
did	O
you	O
know	O
complete	O
a	O
survey	O
in	O
one	O
area	O
i	O
'd	O
switch	O
to	O
the	O
other	O

so	O
i	O
know	O
the	O
greetings	O
in	O
about	O
ten	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
market	O
stuff	O

but	O
in	O
about	O
um	O
about	O
five	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
can	O
do	O
better	O
in	O
it	O

and	BE_IP
my	C
french	O
is	O
pretty	O
good	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
senegalese	O
french	O

so	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
terrified	O
to	O
speak	O
it	O
in	O
um	O
in	O
france	O

yeah	O

because	O
they	O
're	O
real	O
snobby	O
about	O
their	O
language	O

and	O
senegalese	O
french	O
is	O
street	O
french	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
picked	O
it	O
up	O
off	O
the	O
street	O

and	O
i	O
knew	O
what	O
i	O
was	O
i	O
knew	O
what	O
i	O
was	O
communicating	O

but	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
i	O
was	O
saying	O

i	O
never	O
sat	O
there	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
direct	O
translation	O

and	O
said	O
something	O
here	O
when	O
i	O
came	O
home	O
and	O
french	O
to	O
somebody	O

and	O
he	O
paled	O
and	O
said	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
what	O
you	O
said	O

so	O
since	O
then	O
i	O
have	O
refrained	O
from	O
speaking	O
any	O
french	O

except	O

in	O

senegal	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
i	O
said	O
to	O
him	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
ask	O
him	O
either	O

-ay	O
um	O
so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
um	O
about	O
putting	O
an	O
elderly	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

hm	O

um-hum	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

hm	O

um-hum	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

i	O
never	O
thought	O
of	O
that	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

until	O
they	O
get	O
over	O
that	O
hump	O
of	O
whatever	O
it	O
is	O
they	O
're	O
dealing	O
with	O

yes	O

they	O
really	O
are	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
longer	O
than	O
a	O
week	O

yeah	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
mean	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
depends	O
on	O
how	O
how	O
sick	O
the	O
person	O
is	O
too	O
and	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
capable	O
of	O
like	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
family	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
of	O
your	O
own	O

yeah	O

um	O
i	O
would	O
personally	O
like	O
it	O

if	O
my	O
parents	O
were	O
to	O
get	O
ill	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
home	O
and	O
if	O
i	O
had	O
the	O
money	O
with	O
some	O
help	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
always	O
possible	O

but	O
um	O
to	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
my	O
ability	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
until	O
it	O
gets	O
impossible	O

right	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
nursing	O
homes	O
can	O
be	O
good	O

just	O
depends	O
on	O
what	O
kind	O
they	O
are	O

you	O
know	O
an	BE
you	IP
need	C
to	C
check	O
them	O
out	O
ahead	O
of	O
time	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

that	O
they	O
're	O

yeah	O

right	O

an-	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
doing	O
with	O
that	O

yeah	O

well	O
my	O
uh	O
grandmother	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
but	O
a	O
retirement	O
home	O
that	O
also	O
has	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
sort	O
of	O
attached	O
to	O
it	O

and	O
she	O
really	O
liked	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
of	O
moving	O
there	O

she	O
's	O
not	O
ill	O
yet	O
but	O
um	O
she	O
worked	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
volunteer	O
for	O
about	O
ten	O
years	O

and	O
then	O
she	O
decided	O
that	O
um	O
she	O
's	O
eighty	O
five	O
years	O
old	O
that	O
eventually	O
you	O
know	O
she	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
want	O
her	O
family	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
her	O
and	O
being	O
a	O
burden	O

she	O
's	O
very	O
independent	O

so	O
she	O
's	O
in	O
this	O
nursing	O
home	O

it	O
's	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
country	O

and	O
um	O
she	O
really	O
enjoys	O
it	O
right	O
now	O
because	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
wash	O
dishes	O
or	O
cook	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

some	O
support	O

and	O
then	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
wing	O
for	O
those	O
people	O
that	O
do	O
get	O
sick	O

and	O
what	O
i	O
like	O
about	O
it	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
she	O
likes	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
she	O
knows	O
everybody	O
there	O
now	O

and	O
then	O
so	O
if	O
she	O
ever	O
does	O
become	O
ill	O
um	O
it	O
'll	O
be	O
like	O
family	O
around	O
her	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

sh-	O

um-hum	O

no	O

she	O
loves	O
it	O

she	BE_IP
had	C
a	O
great	O
social	O
life	O

and	O
she	O

it	O

and	O
uh	O
i-	O
i	O
hope	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
when	O
i	O
get	O
older	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
definitely	O
it	O
's	O

um-hum	O
right	O

okay	O

well	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
it	O
it	O
varies	O
on	O
on	O
the	O
individual	O
basis	O

uh	O
sometimes	O
it	O
is	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
alternative	O

uh	O
you	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
uh	O
uh	O
family	O
available	O
or	O
family	O
that	O
's	O
uh	O

you	O
may	O
not	O
even	O
have	O
family	O
that	O
is	O
uh	O
in	O
and	O
who	O
around	O

so	O
sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
an	O
alternative	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
but	O
i	O
think	O
also	O
sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
uh	O
a	O
benefit	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
time	O

sometimes	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
um	O
especially	O
after	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
after	O
an	O
acute	O
illness	O

to	O
get	O
over	O
a	O

uh	O
or	O
to	O
rehab	O
after	O
uh	O
an	O
illness	O

sometimes	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
sometimes	O
the	O
nursing	O
homes	O
are	O
good	O
for	O
uh	O
just	O
short	O
periods	O
of	O
time	O

um-hum	O

because	O
too	O
often	O
the	O
acute	O
hospitals	O
will	O
are	O
sending	O
them	O
out	O
much	O
faster	O
than	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
really	O
able	O
to	O

but	O
so	O
so	O
there	O
is	O
some	O
good	O
to	O
it	O

uh	O
sometimes	O
too	O
it	BE
's	IP
used	C
as	C
a	C
dumb	O
job	O

you	O
know	O
the	O
fam-	O
well	O
the	O
families	O
do	O
not	O
necessarily	O
uh	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O

and	BE_IP
they	C
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
responsibility	O

so	BE
they	IP
will	C_IE
put	C_IE
them	C_IP
in	C
a	C
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
you	O
see	O
uh	O

there	O
's	O
both	O
sides	O
to	O
it	O
too	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

well	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
's	O
also	O
where	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
going	O
to	O

it	O
's	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
choice	O
it	O
's	O
because	O
there	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
economically	O
feasible	O
even	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
that	O
that	O
option	O
sometimes	O
is	O
not	O
available	O
if	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
uh	O
either	O
medicare	O
or	O
insurance	O
to	O
cover	O
it	O

so	O

yeah	O

and	O
then	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
some	O
that	O
are	O
set	O
up	O
for	O
specialties	O
uh	O
i	O
know	O
some	O

el-	O
unfortunately	O
some	O
elderly	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
or	O
have	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
alzheimer	O
's	O
or	O
where	O
they	O
wander	O
or	O
or	O
um	O
confused	O
or	O
have	O
some	O
mental	O
problems	O

and	BE
you	IP
need	C
a	C
special	O
nursing	O
home	O
for	O
that	O

you	O
need	O
one	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
unit	O
that	O
's	O
locked	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
and	O
roam	O

and	O
you	O
need	O
people	O
who	O
are	O

for	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
problem	O

yeah	O

so	O
so	O
there	O
's	O
different	O
types	O
of	O
nursing	O
homes	O
i	O
think	O

um-hum	O

gives	O
her	O
a	O

of	O
her	O

she	O

uh	O

that	O
's	O

sense	O
to	O
me	O

although	O
there	O
may	O

i	O

if	O

wor-	O
uh	O
research	O
in	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
just	O
been	O
doing	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
few	O

now	O

so	O
uh	O
i	O
my	O
job	O
has	O
most	O
of	O
the	O

i	O
want	O

um	O
what	O
i	O
really	O
like	O
is	O
i	O
like	O
being	O

like	O
they	O
send	O
me	O
to	O
conferences	O
for	O
instance	O
but	O
probably	O
not	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O

but	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
nice	O
being	O
you	O
know	O
having	O
a	O
company	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
time	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O

and	O
sort	O
of	O

uh	O
they	O
also	O

a	O
really	O
important	O
thing	O
to	O
me	O
is	O
when	O
they	O
uh	O
they	O

like	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
get	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
good	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

right	O

um	O
so	O
do	BE
you	IP

our	C

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
agree	O
uh	O

uh	O
do	O
you	O

problem	O
i	O

i	O

that	O
the	O
bureaucracy	O
in	O
our	O

uh	O
the	O

that	O
that	O

uh	O
you	O

a	O

that	O

officially	O

we	O

that	O
that	O

there	O
's	O
an	O

that	O
you	O

i	O

that	O
uh	O
all	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
perks	O
that	O
we	O
've	O

i	O

i	O

on	O

back	O
a	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O

uh	O
during	O

how	O
you	O

right	O

i	O

uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
part	O

you	O
're	O
in	O
but	O
i	O

it	O
's	O
uh	O
fairly	O
industrial	O

right	O
uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
about	O
you	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
always	O
considered	O
automobiles	O
to	O
be	O
probably	O
the	O
the	O
prime	O
contributor	O

i	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
automobiles	O
would	O
probably	O
do	O
more	O
than	O
their	O
fair	O

of	O
that	O

yeah	O

that	BE
's	IP
yeah	C_IE
that	C_IE
's	C_IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
big	O
issue	O
is	O
you	O
know	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
states	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
uh	O
inspection	O

so	O
you	O
get	O
you	O
get	O
a	O

of	O
people	O
out	O
there	O
without	O
e._t._r.	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O

sure	O

right	O

i	O

from	O
what	O
i	O
hear	O
though	O
uh	O
next	O

right	O

i	O
hope	O
i	O
i	O
'm	O
hoping	O
that	O

uh	O
i	O

a	O
an	O

about	O

how	O
fast	O
that	O
's	O
going	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
disappearing	O
a	O

quicker	O
than	O

i	O

right	O
now	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
primarily	O

about	O

the	O

it	O

um-hum	O

right	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

that	O

uh	O
those	O

those	O

uh	O
i	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
an	O

there	O

uh	O
what	O

realize	O
those	O
third	O

what	O
they	O

is	O
how	O
quickly	O
the	O

i	O

the	O

it	O

that	O
that	O

uh	O
that	O

good	O
uh	O
example	O
of	O

in	O
a	O

kind	O
of	O

mexico	O

does	O
i	O

mexico	BE_IP

one	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
in	O
in	O

for	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
pretty	O
lucky	O

i	O
've	O
lived	O
in	O
cities	O
that	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
that	O
much	O
of	O
a	O

although	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
really	O
kind	O
of	O
based	O
in	O
orlando	O
florida	O

and	O
there	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
getting	O
worse	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
it	O
definitely	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
at	O
a	O
level	O
comparable	O
to	O
los	O

or	O
denver	O

but	O
you	O
can	O

exactly	O

yeah	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
much	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
of	O
public	O

down	O
there	O

there	O
is	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
it	O
's	O

uh	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
you	O
know	O

you	O
get	O
uh	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
uh	O
coast	O
here	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
bit	O
of	O
uh	O
smog	O
and	O
stuff	O
especially	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
uh	O
fuel	O
cracking	O
towers	O
and	O
chemical	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O

when	O
you	O
get	O
further	O
east	O
towards	O
new	O
york	O
city	O
it	O
gets	O
very	O
industrial	O
but	O
i	O
'm	O
i	O
'm	O
about	O
uh	O
thirty	O
miles	O
west	O
of	O
there	O

so	O
you	O
have	O
uh	O
actually	O
green	O
trees	O
and	O
such	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
notice	O
that	O
that	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
new	O
jersey	O
exists	O

actually	O
very	O

yeah	O
you	O
you	O
go	O
even	O
a	O
few	O
wi-	O
miles	O
out	O
and	O
you	O
got	O
uh	O
farms	O
and	O
everything	O

so	O
you	O
relatively	O
clear	O
air	O

but	O
uh	O

oh	O
de-	O
definitely	O

it	O
's	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
large	O
number	O
of	O
them	O
on	O
the	O

they	O
're	O
all	O
yeah	O
going	O

and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
in	O
relatively	O
poor	O

oh	O
e-	O
even	O
where	O
you	O
do	O
have	O
the	O
inspections	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
inspection	O
is	O
once	O
a	O

you	O
get	O
the	O
car	O
that	O
's	O
in	O
the	O

that	O

and	O
i	O

some	O
of	O
the	O
uh	O
car	O
companies	O
are	O
coming	O
out	O
with	O
uh	O

so	O
you	O

natural	O
gas	O
powered	O
rather	O
than	O
uh	O
gasoline	O

it	O
it	O
is	O
coming	O
from	O

i	O

the	O
uh	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

it	O
it	O

no	O

it	O

that	O
uh	O
you	O

the	O
third	O

are	O
less	O

and	O
they	O

or	O
they	O

well	O
not	O
not	O
as	O
hard	O
as	O
some	O

you	O

uh	O
because	O

well	O
i	O
uh	O
i	O
give	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
figured	O
that	O

i	O
just	O
donate	O
to	O
that	O

yeah	O

i	O
take	O

a	O
uh	O
a	O

a	O

my	O

well	O
she	O
was	O

for	O
a	O

it	O
's	O

oh	O

and	O
we	O

a	O

i-	BE_IP
i	C

and	O
i	O

you	O

and	O
i	O

and	O
you	O

check	O
my	O

and	O
my	O

and	O
you	O

because	O

you	O

i	O

what	O

what	O

your	O

uh	O

yes	O

yes	O

um	O
i	O

in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
it	O
it	O

the	O

yes	O

right	O

that	O
would	O

the	O

if	O
if	O
the	O

then	O

i	O

i	O

we	O

the	O
wrong	O

right	O

you	O
you	O
can	O
apologize	O
nicely	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
know	O
i	O

you	O

the	O
the	O
price	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
i	O
've	O

quotes	O

it	O
's	O
better	O
that	O
a	O

go	O
free	O
than	O
one	O
person	O
be	O
unjustly	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
really	O
the	O
the	O
philosophy	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
our	O
legal	O
system	O
works	O

yeah	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
i	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
's	O
being	O
used	O
now	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
you	O
listen	O
to	O
bush	O
's	O
you	O
know	O

well	O
where	O
are	O
we	O
going	O
to	O
impose	O
dr-	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
for	O
drug	O
dealers	O
is	O
the	O
new	O
big	O
thing	O
like	O
in	O

tsongas	O
is	O
also	O
saying	O
you	O
know	O
capital	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
capital	O
crime	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
major	O
drug	O

and	O
again	O
i	O

these	O

they	O

their	O
lives	O

yeah	O

and	O
and	O
you	O

uh	O
especially	O
you	O

i	O
live	O
in	O
in	O

you	O

w-	O
w-	O
we	O
're	O

to	O

capital	O
punishment	O
here	O
probably	O
after	O
the	O
second	O
coming	O
or	O
something	O

so	O
you	O

you	O
look	O
at	O
our	O
our	O

and	O
things	O

that	O
and	O
you	O
compare	O
them	O
to	O
to	O

texas	O
or	O
someplace	O
that	O
does	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
it	O
it	O
's	O

that	O
it	BE

it	C
's	C
affecting	O

in	O

i	O

it	O
's	O
mainly	O
people	O
like	O
they	O
get	O
the	O
vengeance	O
of	O
it	O

because	O
you	O

oh	O
yeah	O
it	O
's	O
mainl-	O

of	O

also	O
a	O

people	O

you	O

your	O
a	O
a	O
a	O
sixty	O
two	O

is	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O

from	O
what	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
when	O
you	O
listen	O
to	O
like	O
the	O
uh	O
the	O
the	O
victims'	O
families	O
and	O
things	O
they	O
're	O
always	O
talking	O
about	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O
feeling	O
justified	O
or	O
feeling	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
they	O
've	O
gotten	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

i	O
mean	O
my	O
thought	O
has	O
been	O
once	O
the	O
guy	O
has	O
been	O
imprisoned	O
if	O
he	O
goes	O
to	O
jail	O
forever	O
or	O
whatever	O
or	O
if	O
he	O
gets	O
killed	O
it	O
should	O
n't	O
make	O
any	O
difference	O
to	O
the	O
uh	O
to	O
the	O
victim	O
's	O
family	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
should	O
really	O
i	O
mean	O

obviously	O
if	O
someone	O
of	O
mine	O
who	O
was	O
close	O
died	O
i	O
'd	O
probably	O
feel	O
differently	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
th-	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
important	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
be	O
caught	O
and	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
danger	O
to	O
society	O

right	O

i	O
mean	O
the	O

right	O

and	O
the	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
was	O
reading	O
through	O
a	O
book	O
on	O
uh	O
genome	O
human	O
genome	O
research	O
and	O
now	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
things	O
like	O
schizophrenia	O

and	O
what	O
if	O
it	O
just	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
genetic	O
or	O
biochemical	O
in	O
origin	O

so	O
if	O
someday	O
we	O
can	O
go	O
to	O
jeff	O
dahmer	O
and	O
say	O
well	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
you	O
you	O
've	O
got	O
an	O
endorphin	O
imbalance	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
take	O
this	O
regularly	O
you	O
'll	O
be	O
a	O
sane	O
and	O
productive	O
member	O
of	O
society	O
you	O
know	O

you	O
really	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
someone	O
responsible	O
for	O
their	O
actions	O

society	O
made	O
me	O
do	O
it	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O
some	O
statistics	O
that	O
say	O
that	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
expensive	O
to	O
kill	O
somebody	O
than	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
prison	O
for	O
life	O

right	O

well	O
that	O
's	O

committing	O
them	O
mostly	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
either	O
crimes	O
of	O
passion	O
or	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O

or	O
they	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
caught	O

or	O

yeah	O

but	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
also	O
have	O
to	O
think	O
whether	O
it	O
's	O
worthwhile	O
on	O
the	O
individual	O
basis	O
for	O
example	O
someone	O
like	O
uh	O
jeffrey	O
dahmer	O

do	O
you	O
want	O

by	O
putting	O
him	O
in	O
prison	O
for	O
life	O
there	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
possibility	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
get	O
out	O
again	O

whereas	O
if	O
you	O
kill	O
him	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
that	O
possibility	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
he	O
could	O
ever	O
redeem	O
himself	O

but	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
yes	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
it	O
's	O
it	O
's	O

yeah	O

once	O
you	O
've	O
made	O
a	O
decision	O
that	O
way	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
difficult	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
on	O
it	O

oh	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
a-	O

the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
doubt	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
iota	O
is	O
uh	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
uh	O
person	O
who	O
is	O
accused	O

right	O

yeah	O

that	O
there	O
there	O
they	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
profit	O
margin	O
of	O
drug	O
dealers	O
the	O
profit	O
margin	O
's	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
yeah	O
the	O
the	O
risk	O
is	O
almost	O
not	O
there	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
also	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
georgia	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
the	O
big	O
thing	O
down	O
there	O
was	O
all	O
right	O
we	O
have	O
capital	O
punishment	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
who	O
gets	O
accused	O
and	O
who	O
are	O
the	O
ones	O
who	O
actually	O
get	O
executed	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
racially	O
related	O
and	O
ethnically	O
related	O

right	O

right	O

right	O

and	O
that	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
also	O
by	O
keeping	O
them	O
in	O
prison	O
you	O
do	O
have	O
the	O
possibility	O
though	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
currently	O
do	O
this	O
of	O

you	O
you	O

um-hum	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
i-	O
i	O

on	O
some	O

it	O
you	O

someone	O

mine	O
's	O
pretty	O

actually	O

uh	O
i	O

i	O
can	O

that	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

you	O

so	O
you	O

you	O

um	O

in	O

what	O

you	O

right	O

would	O
you	O

that	O
for	O

auto	O

is	O

what	O
kind	O
of	O

is	O
that	O

okay	O

and	O
you	O
put	O
up	O
set	O
up	O
the	O
track	O
pylons	O

okay	O

oh	O
really	O

yeah	O

i	O
would	O
guess	O
so	O

uh	O
i	O
think	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
get	O
uh	O
b._m._w.	O
or	O
if	O
i	O
go	O
the	O
german	O
route	O
which	O
i	O
'm	O
kind	O
of	O
leaning	O
towards	O
right	O
now	O
but	O
uh	O
or	O
maybe	O
a	O
hon-	O
i	O
mean	O
a	O
a	O
acura	O
legend	O
uh	O
a	O
lexus	O
uh	O
s.	O
c.	O
three	O
hundred	O
maybe	O
something	O
on	O
that	O
order	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
determined	O
if	O
i	O
like	O
the	O
the	O
japanese	O
or	O
the	O
if	O
i	O
like	O
them	O
enough	O
to	O
purchase	O
one	O
you	O
know	O
because	O
your	O
b._m._w.s	O
your	O
german	O
cars	O
have	O
good	O
reputations	O
i	O
think	O

yes	O

the	O

yeah	O

they	O
their	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
whole	O
philosophy	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
they	O
kind	O
of	O
even	O
brainwash	O
themselves	O
into	O
thinking	O
they	O
're	O
better	O
which	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	O
to	O
take	O

i	O
mean	O
as	O
you	O
're	O
walking	O
through	O
that	O
little	O
tour	O
in	O
uh	O
munich	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
they	O
're	O
trying	O
to	O
brainwash	O
you	O
too	O

oh	O
really	O

um	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O

no	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
realistic	O

yeah	O

if	O
you	O
can	O
afford	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
toy	O
then	O
i	O
guess	O
so	O

yeah	O

just	O
work	O

short	O
trips	O

no	O
m-	O
no	O
heavy	O
mileage	O

i	O
'm	O
putting	O
on	O
less	O
than	O
fifteen	O
thousand	O
miles	O
a	O
year	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
minimal	O

lasts	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

that	O
's	O
mainly	O
what	O
i	O
'm	O
looking	O
for	O

oh	O
yeah	O

but	O
but	O
if	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
a	O
mercedes	O
you	O
take	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
shop	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
hit	O
you	O
up	O
for	O
just	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O

uh	O
i	O
think	O
well	O
something	O
on	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
a	O
three	O
series	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
different	O

once	O
you	O
get	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
five	O
series	O
and	O
higher	O
then	O
all	O
your	O
repair	O
costs	O
go	O
up	O
significantly	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
ki-	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
i	O
really	O
want	O

think	O
about	O
uh	O
taxes	O

you	O
spend	O
what	O
you	O
have	O

and	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
general	O
idea	O
is	O
to	O
s-	O
you	O
know	O
spend	O
uh	O
during	O
a	O
time	O
of	O
recession	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
the	O
deficit	O
spending	O
to	O
help	O
pick	O
up	O
the	O
economy	O

but	O
they	O
're	O
running	O
under	O
the	O
assump-	O

you	O
know	O
the	O
way	O
they	O
're	O
running	O
it	O
now	O
they	O
're	O
h-	O
you	O
know	O
running	O
it	O
under	O
a	O
deficit	O
spending	O
you	O
know	O
while	O
we	O
're	O
not	O
under	O
a	O
recession	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
never	O
any	O
surplus	O
coming	O
in	O
to	O
counter	O
the	O
deficit	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
running	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
basic	O
thing	O
of	O
economics	O
i	O
guess	O
keep	O
spending	O
keep	O
going	O
into	O
debt	O

you	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
payoff	O
what	O
you	O
owe	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
the	O
question	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
uh	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
f-	O
you	O
know	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O

yeah	O

there	O
's	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

i	O
guess	O

i	BE
'm	IE
a	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	C
student	O
right	O
now	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

a	O

and	O
so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
do	O
n't	O
pay	O
a	O
proportionate	O
amount	O
of	O
taxes	O
to	O
i	O
guess	O
uh	O
compared	O
to	O
what	O
i	O
get	O
because	O
i	O
you	O

all	O
my	O
my	O

uh	O
my	O

i	O

i	O

i	O
i	O

all	O

my	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

more	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

wow	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
is	O
n't	O

uh-huh	O

there	O

a	O

uh-huh	O

the	O

the	O
the	O
the	O

is	O
a	O

more	O
visible	O
portion	O
of	O
the	O

i	O

uh-huh	O

there	O
was	O
that	O

which	O
can-	O

was	O
it	O
jerry	O
brown	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
democratic	O

had	O
a	O
proposal	O
for	O
doing	O
away	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
the	O
tax	O
codes	O
they	O
have	O
now	O
and	O
implementing	O
a	O
f-	O
i	O
think	O
a	O
flat	O
percentage	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

exactly	O

that	O
's	O
because	O
up	O
until	O
like	O
eight	O

up	O
until	O
like	O
eighty	O
five	O
or	O
something	O
was	O
the	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
a	O
necessary	O
evil	O

uh	O
i	O
wish	O
the	O
government	O
would	O
operate	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
premise	O
that	O
uh	O

operate	O
on	O

and	O
that	O
is	O
uh	O
you	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
spend	O
more	O
than	O
you	O
than	O
you	O
bring	O
in	O

well	O
i	O

it	O
just	O
depends	O

uh	O
uh	O
roads	O
are	O
very	O
expensive	O
uh	O
commodity	O
and	O
so	O
is	O
uh	O
utilities	O
they	O
supply	O
and	O
police	O
and	O
fire	O
department	O
uh	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
living	O

so	O
i	O
think	O
for	O
for	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
uh	O
we	O
've	O
paid	O
teachers	O
and	O
police	O
officers	O
and	O
firemen	O
who	O
are	O
uh	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
extent	O
public	O
servants	O
uh	O
we	O
have	O
not	O
paid	O
them	O
really	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
worth	O
in	O
what	O
they	O
contribute	O
to	O
society	O

but	O
uh	O
then	O
again	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
hard	O
to	O
justify	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
wastefulness	O
of	O
money	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
spends	O
on	O
all	O
levels	O
of	O
of	O
uh	O
government	O
including	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
state	O
and	O
federal	O
governments	O

uh	O
you	O
're	O
very	O
fortunate	O

we	O
just	O
try	O
not	O
to	O
pay	O
any	O
more	O
in	O
than	O
we	O
have	O
to	O

uh	O
we	O
pay	O
in	O
a	O
substantial	O
amount	O
uh	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
regret	O
paying	O
taxes	O

we	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
sometimes	O
uh	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
reverse	O
of	O
a	O
regressive	O
tax	O
a	O
progressive	O
tax	O

and	O
progressive	O
tax	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
does	O
not	O
give	O
people	O

to	O

more	O

uh	O
we	BE
were	IP

be	O

seventy	O

eighty	O
percent	O

now	O
that	O

that	O
you	O
're	O
not	O

you	O

you	O

but	O
you	O
probably	O

more	O
percentage	O

in	O

if	O
you	O

a	O

uh	O
he	O

as	O

if	O

they	O
would	O

to	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
i	O
think	O
so	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
i-	O
i	O
guess	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
we	O
felt	O
that	O
it	O
it	O
's	O
nice	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
dog	O
even	O
though	O
there	O
are	O
you	O
know	O
complications	O
come	O
with	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
with	O
our	O
children	O
uh	O

at	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
oh	O
grade	O
five	O
and	O
and	O
grade	O
eight	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
age	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
uh	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
good	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
discipline	O
that	O
goes	O
with	O
with	O
having	O
a	O
pet	O

uh	O

yeah	O

right	O

uh	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
idea	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
perhaps	O

uh	O
it	O
depends	O
on	O
the	O
on	O
everyone	O
's	O
discipline	O

and	O
uh	O
from	O
that	O
aspect	O
i	O
'm	O
short	O
on	O
the	O
discipline	O
because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
uh	O
enforce	O
that	O
the	O
kids	O
look	O
after	O
the	O
dog	O

and	BE
uh	IP
we	C
've	C
had	O
him	O
about	O
four	O
years	O
now	O

uh	O
but	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
does	O
it	O
it	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
necessary	O
that	O
individuals	O
have	O
the	O
discipline	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
the	O
animal	O
properly	O
uh	O

yeah	O

uh	O

actually	O
no	O

we	O
live	O
in	O
a	O
in	O
an	O
area	O
that	O
's	O
oh	O
probably	O
about	O
two	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
university	O

uh	O
we	O
live	O
right	O
might	O
say	O
we	O
live	O
right	O
in	O
uh	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
a	O
residential	O
area	O

and	O
uh	O
so	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

this	O
dog	O
being	O
a	O
small	O
dog	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
more	O
you	O
more	O
acceptable	O
but	O
again	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
uh	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
concerns	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
uh	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
to	O
be	O
gained	O
from	O
a	O
relationship	O
with	O
an	O
animal	O

but	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
one	O
has	O
to	O
recognize	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
physical	O
requirements	O
of	O
of	O
the	O
animal	O
and	O
the	O
larger	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
more	O
room	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
exercise	O

right	O

well	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

so	O
um	O
with	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
um	O
i	O
actually	O
found	O
the	O
whole	O
question	O
about	O

you	O

a	O
a	O

a	O

it	O

the	O

where	O
it	O
was	O
okay	O
for	O
a	O

to	O
have	O
it	O

eleven	O
out	O

twelve	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
'd	O
be	O
curious	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
um	O
requirement	O
for	O
a	O
an	O
acquittal	O
is	O

i	O
mean	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
wrong	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
eleven	O
out	O
of	O
twelve	O
can	O
convict	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
something	O

saying	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
voted	O
not	O
guilty	O
then	O
instead	O
of	O
it	O
being	O
a	O
hung	O

that	O
was	O
an	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

an	O
anani-	O
a	O
unanimous	O
uh	O

to	O

yeah	O

i	O
'd	O
agree	O

i	O
've	O

five	O

oh	O

well	O
the	O
people	O
i	O
know	O
who	O
've	O

have	O
said	O
that	O
usually	O
what	O

opposing	O
the	O

uh	O
you	O

so	O

the	O

everyone	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

once	O

hi	O

yeah	O

actually	O
i	O
a-	O
i	O
agree	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
interesting	O
thing	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
believe	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
for	O
for	O
civil	O
suits	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
unanimous	O
right	O

but	O
for	O
for	O
criminal	O
suits	O
it	O
's	O
unanimous	O
by	O
federal	O
law	O

yeah	O

i	O
actually	O
thought	O
i	O
'd	O
read	O
that	O
too	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
i	O
phrased	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

i	O
wonder	O

the	O
difference	O
yeah	O
the	O
difference	O
could	O
be	O
that	O
for	O
um	O
state	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
state	O
felonies	O
versus	O
federal	O
felonies	O
that	O
federal	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
under	O
federal	O
jurisdiction	O
require	O
the	O
unanimous	O
vote	O

and	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
under	O
state	O
jurisdiction	O
even	O
criminal	O
do	O
n't	O
require	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
the	O
laws	O

do	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
unreasonable	O
um	O
requirement	O
that	O
they	O
be	O
unanimous	O

yeah	O

that	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
interesting	O
change	O

it	O
would	O
also	O
allow	O
i-	O
the	O
um	O
idea	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
had	O
one	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
um	O
very	O
disagreeable	O
that	O
i	O
mean	O
i-	O
it	O
fundamentally	O
changes	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
processing	O
occurs	O
because	O
um	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
well	O
the	O
the	O
principle	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
unanimous	O
insures	O
the	O
beyond	O
a	O
reasonable	O
doubt	O
um	O
criterion	O
that	O
it	O
um	O
increases	O
the	O
the	O
likelihood	O
of	O
getting	O
the	O
proper	O
judgment	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
if	O
anything	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
close	O
to	O
unanimous	O
decision	O

yeah	O

actually	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
thought	O
that	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
interesting	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

i	O

to	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
've	O

twenty	O
some	O

when	O
my	O

i	O

that	O

me	O

a	O
better	O

i	O

i	O
really	O
believe	O
that	O

and	O
it	O
has	O

us	O
to	O

some	O

for	O
our	O

that	O
we	O
could	O
n't	O
otherwise	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
are	O

at	O
this	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
our	O

a	O

so	O
i	O
know	O
it	O
sounds	O

a	O
rationalization	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
i	O
really	O

it	O
's	O
true	O
for	O
our	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
it	O

there	O
's	O
no	O

i	O

really	O
the	O

if	O
if	O
a	O

is	O

that	O

i	O
was	O
twenty	O
nine	O
when	O
i	O

my	O
first	O

and	O
um	O
i	O
would	O

it	O
's	O
a	O

it	O
's	O
wonderful	O
to	O

but	O
um	O
i	O

the	O
way	O
i	O

it	O

i	O

of	O
the	O
things	O
i	O

i	O

we	O

very	O
carefully	O
the	O
um	O
alternative	O
situations	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
them	O
in	O

some	O

again	O
i	O
know	O
it	O
sounds	O

a	O
rationalization	O

but	O
i	O
really	O
do	O
think	O
sometimes	O
they	O
very	O
early	O
on	O
are	O
around	O
lots	O
of	O

and	O
they	O
they	O

they	O
learn	O
not	O

to	O
be	O
the	O

that	O
at	O
the	O

we	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
they	O

that	O

your	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
this	O
one	O
was	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
a	O

so	O
when	O
you	O
walked	O
in	O
everything	O
looks	O
cool	O

the	O
problem	O
i	O
had	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
show	O

to	O
the	O
children	O
enough	O

they	O
did	O
not	O

them	O

to	O
these	O
small	O
children	O
who	O
are	O
being	O
left	O

um	O
they	O

one	O
time	O
i	O
picked	O
up	O
this	O
little	O

who	O
was	O

and	O
the	O

came	O
and	O
just	O

me	O
up	O
one	O

the	O

you	O

you	O

this	O

was	O

you	O

they	O

one	O
that	O
sounds	O
kind	O

like	O
what	O
you	O
were	O
in	O

it	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
really	O
good	O
one	O

and	O
in	O
fact	O
it	O
worked	O
out	O
for	O
us	O
because	O
my	O

we	O
kind	O
of	O
bartered	O

my	O

then	O
you	O

um-hum	O

hm	O

yeah	O

did	O
did	O
they	O
separate	O
them	O
by	O

because	O
i	O
'd	O
think	O
you	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
was	O
important	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

it	O
it	O
sound	O

yeah	O

it	O
sounds	O
like	O
to	O
me	O
your	O
your	O
concern	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
they	O
are	O

people	O
that	O
they	BE

or	O
something	O

uh	O
um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i-	O
i-	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
really	O
important	O
thing	O
because	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
doctorates	O
and	O
p._h._d.	O
's	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
know	O
all	O
the	O
technical	O
stuff	O

but	O
if	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
reach	O
out	O
and	O
touch	O
the	O
kids	O
then	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
do	O
any	O
good	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

an-	O

the	O
other	O
the	O
other	O
group	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O

the	O
other	O
one	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
husband	O
and	O
wife	O
team	O
and	O
we	O
knew	O
them	O
from	O
other	O
associations	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
strict	O
one	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
she	O
would	O
she	O
'd	O
put	O
her	O
arm	O
around	O
the	O
kids	O
and	O
talk	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
stuff	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
he	O
was	O
actually	O
the	O
more	O
um	O
the	O
more	O
uh	O
what	O
demonstrative	O
type	O
the	O
more	O
loving	O

he	O
would	O
you	O
know	O
laugh	O
with	O
the	O
kids	O
and	O
play	O
with	O
the	O
kids	O

and	O
and	O
it	O
it	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
that	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
actually	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
group	O
that	O
that	O
did	O
that	O
side	O

what	O

or	O

ourselves	O

you	O

we	O
s-	O

tend	O
to	O

them	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
things	O
to	O
me	O
recently	O
was	O
you	O
know	O
during	O
the	O
war	O
uh	O
in	O
uh	O
kuwait	O
was	O
uh	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
retaliate	O
for	O
the	O
uh	O
scud	O
missiles	O
that	O
were	O
uh	O
launched	O
there	O

that	O
just	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
uh	O
a	O
phenomenal	O
uh	O
demonstration	O
of	O
restraint	O

and	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
reflected	O
uh	O
uh	O
some	O
awful	O
good	O
uh	O
diplomacy	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
u._s.	O

i	O
see	O

uh	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
the	O
codes	O
from	O
the	O
u._s.	O
already	O

i	O
see	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

they	O
can	O

n't	O
they	O

yeah	O

well	O
what	O
do	O
you	O

what	O
about	O
this	O
situation	O
with	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
uh	O
continual	O
uh	O
harassment	O
by	O
iraq	O
right	O
now	O
and	O
uh	O
apparently	O
failing	O

um-hum	O

okay	O

sure	O

um	O

right	O

um-hum	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
we	O
should	O
ignore	O
it	O
and	O
just	O
allowed	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
move	O
on	O
into	O

what	O
happened	O

um-hum	O

right	O

yeah	O

well	O
may	O
have	O
been	O

you	O
know	O
i	O

not	O

that	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
the	O
case	O
uh	O

it	O
right	O

no	O

no	O

it	O
does	O
n't	O
look	O

on	O
uh	O
israel	O
's	O

a	O

so	O
i	O
work	O
and	O
go	O

about	O

and	O
uh	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
do	O

we	O

i	O

they	O
just	O

us	O

we	O

or	O
you	O

or	O

or	O
anything	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

what	O
about	O
you	O

hm	O

yeah	O

uh	O
they	O
do	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
uh	O
research	O
title	O
staff	O
here	O

then	O
i	O
know	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
gotten	O
their	O
masters	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
um	O
they	O
might	O
you	O
know	O
pay	O
for	O
that	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
classes	O
and	O
stuff	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
they	O
let	O
you	O
they	O
'll	O
let	O
you	O
decrease	O
how	O
many	O
hours	O
you	O
work	O
by	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
percentage	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
'll	O
let	O
you	O
work	O

if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
finish	O

you	O
want	O
to	O

yeah	O

if	O
they	O
'll	O
let	O
you	O
work	O
decrease	O
your	O
number	O
of	O
hours	O
by	O
any	O
percentage	O
just	O
just	O
about	O
so	O
if	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
your	O
masters	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
think	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
get	O
like	O
a	O
with	O
your	O
extra	O
degrees	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
pay	O
raise	O
due	O

so	O
that	O
'll	O
probably	O
help	O
out	O

but	O

do	O
you	O
get	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
health	O
care	O
type	O
stuff	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
mean	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
i-	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
important	O
uh	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
there	O
because	O
that	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
really	O
expensive	O
if	O
you	O
ever	O
have	O
any	O
health	O
problems	O

my	O

i	O

my	O

i	O

uh	O
health	O

but	O
it	O
definitely	O

something	O
to	O
look	O

once	O
i	O

my	O

uh-huh	O

yes	O

the	O
only	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
only	O
real	O
um	O

i	O
guess	O
you	O
could	O
say	O
working	O
for	O
me	O

besides	O
i	O

i	O
'm	O

though	O
that	O
's	O
about	O

there	O

so	O

that	O
's	O
about	O
the	O
only	O

i	O
have	O
to	O

they	O

they	O

they	O

or	O
how	O
does	O
that	O
work	O

oh	O
okay	O

your	O
talking	O
about	O
corpor-	O

sure	O

okay	O

well	O

but	O
in	O
some	O
instances	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
put	O
companies	O
out	O
of	O
business	O
by	O
taking	O

if	O
they	O

okay	O

oh	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

right	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O

hm	O

sure	O

okay	O

well	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
an	O
insurance	O
company	O

so	O
i	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
uh	O
verdicts	O
that	O
are	O
pretty	O
crazily	O
decided	O
um	O
by	O
juries	O
particularly	O

and	O
i	O
know	O
in	O
england	O
the	O
judges	O
set	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
awards	O

you	O
know	O
juries	O
will	O
decide	O
the	O
guilt	O
or	O
innocence	O

but	O
then	O
they	O
leave	O
the	O
awards	O
up	O
to	O
more	O
learned	O
people	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
maybe	O
that	O
avoids	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
totally	O
ridiculous	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
millions	O
and	O
millions	O
of	O
dollars	O

oh	O
exactly	O

each	O
individual	O
jury	O
really	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
perception	O
of	O
what	O
um	O
the	O
going	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
will	O
the	O
going	O
uh	O
award	O
should	O
be	O
for	O
a	O
certain	O
type	O
of	O
case	O
you	O
know	O
within	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
range	O

when	O
you	O
get	O
one	O
way	O
out	O
like	O
that	O

that	O
then	O
really	O
does	O
n't	O
penali-	O
wind	O
up	O
penalizing	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
after	O

who	O
it	O
really	O
penalizes	O
is	O
their	O
insurance	O
company	O
which	O
then	O
translates	O
into	O
higher	O
rates	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
if	O
they	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
mega	O
awards	O
against	O
them	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
sit	O
there	O
and	O
lose	O
money	O

if	O
they	O
're	O
losing	O
money	O
then	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
raise	O
rates	O

so	O
it	O
all	O
comes	O
filtering	O
down	O
to	O
us	O
all	O
i-	O
i-	O
individually	O

and	O
uh	O
granted	O
some	O
people	O
need	O
to	O
be	O

if	O
they	O
have	O
really	O
been	O

you	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

you	O
know	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
health	O
insurance	O
is	O
written	O
that	O
way	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O
buy	O
an	O
accident	O
and	O
death	O
or	O
dismemberment	O
policy	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
s-	O
pre	O

in	O
the	O

uh	O
so	O
much	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
necessarily	O
put	O
a	O
a	O
value	O
on	O
somebody	O

uh	O
arbitrarily	O
that	O
is	O
always	O
going	O
to	O
fit	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O

i	O
think	O
maybe	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
uh	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
and	O
their	O
station	O
in	O

and	O
and	O
uh	O
how	O

longer	O
they	O
have	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
up	O
you	O

with	O
with	O
that	O

i	O
mean	O
maybe	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
award	O
an	O
eighty	O
five	O

old	O
guy	O
the	O

thing	O
that	O
you	O
'd	O
award	O
a	O
twenty	O
one	O

i-	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
common	O
sense	O
applied	O
there	O

and	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
where	O
the	O
judiciary	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
learned	O
about	O
that	O
s-	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O
because	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
schooled	O
in	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

and	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
continuing	O
education	O
maybe	O
for	O
judges	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

you	O
know	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
economics	O
of	O
things	O
uh	O

because	O
if	O
they	O
wheel	O
somebody	O
into	O
a	O
courtroom	O
and	O
the	O
jury	O
's	O
heart	O
goes	O
out	O
to	O
that	O
person	O
and	O
they	O
do	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
mega	O
awards	O
it	O
really	O
you	O
know	O
ultimately	O
is	O
not	O
penalizing	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
trying	O
to	O

anyway	O

if	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
company	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
insured	O
unless	O
the	O
award	O
is	O
so	O

that	O
it	O
goes	O
all	O
beyond	O
their	O

of	O

which	O
is	O
another	O
pet	O
peeve	O
of	O
mine	O
when	O
they	O
do	O
award	O
punitive	O

i	O
think	O
those	O
should	O
be	O
uninsurable	O

i	O
think	O
those	O
should	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
by	O
the	O
corporation	O
itself	O
that	O
that	O
did	O
the	O
damage	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

for	O
for	O
honest	O
mistakes	O
where	O
they	O
've	O
done	O
something	O
and	O
and	O
something	O
happens	O

one	O
of	O
their	O
employees	O
causes	O
damage	O
or	O
something	O

sure	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
they	O
buy	O
insurance	O
for	O

but	O
well	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
talking	O
about	O
any	O
company	O

uh	O
let	O
's	O
just	O
say	O
a	O
lumber	O
manufacturing	O
company	O

and	O
uh	O
somebody	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
premises	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
employees	O
actually	O
is	O
driving	O
by	O
with	O
a	O
forklift	O

and	O
he	O
pushes	O
the	O
wrong	O
button	O

and	O
he	O
drops	O
a	O
load	O
of	O
lumber	O
on	O
somebody	O

and	O
it	O
injures	O
them	O

sure	O

insurance	O
should	O
pay	O
for	O
that	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
talking	O
about	O
any	O
loss	O

i	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
only	O
losses	O
that	O
are	O
judged	O
for	O
a	O
punitive	O
damage	O
which	O
is	O
another	O
category	O
of	O
the	O
juries	O
are	O
awarding	O
damages	O
these	O
days	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
person	O
's	O
actual	O
injuries	O
and	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
due	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
're	O
awarding	O
a	O
second	O
amount	O
as	O
punishment	O
to	O
the	O
company	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
l-	O
usually	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
an	O
amount	O
their	O
designed	O
to	O
sting	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
for	O
their	O
negligence	O
for	O
gross	O
wanton	O
negligence	O
in	O
a	O
claim	O

and	O
unfortunately	O
the	O
j-	O
the	O

lately	O
the	O
courts	O
have	O
been	O
deciding	O
that	O
those	O
could	O
be	O
paid	O
for	O
by	O
insurance	O
too	O

so	O
again	O
it	O
never	O
really	O
penalizes	O
the	O
company	O
doing	O
the	O
wrong	O

they	O
can	O
go	O
right	O
on	O
doing	O
the	O
same	O
old	O
thing	O
they	O
always	O
used	O
to	O

and	O
if	O
they	O
if	O
they	O
know	O
some	O
practice	O
is	O
wrong	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
talking	O
about	O
your	O
isolated	O
occurrences	O

i	O
'm	O
talking	O
more	O
about	O
the	O
you	O

the	O

that	O
they	O

maybe	O
they	O
're	O
willfully	O
manufacturing	O
something	O
that	O
they	O
know	O
is	O
hurting	O

out	O

and	O
they	O
continue	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
even	O
after	O
they	O
become	O
aware	O
of	O
that	O

then	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O

to	O

something	O
out	O
of	O
their	O

steve	O
this	O
is	O

like	O
i	O

brian	O
and	O
i	O

we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
talking	O
about	O

uh	O

in	O
uh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
uh	O
we	O
're	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O

my	O

and	O
she	O
is	O
taking	O

of	O
the	O

we	O

had	O
to	O
look	O
for	O

either	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
nice	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
have	O
like	O
you	O

a	O

of	O

a	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
critical	O
about	O

the	O

thirty	O

forty	O
kids	BE_IP

only	O
one	O

then	O
uh	O
something	O

uh	O

of	O
the	O

uh	O
they	O

that	O
the	O

are	O
being	O

not	O
just	O
playing	O
around	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
depends	O
also	O
upon	O
the	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
uh	O
we	O
uh	O

a	O
a	O

it	BE

n't	O
want	O
to	O
just	O
take	O
them	O
to	O
somebody	O
i	O
pick	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
yellow	O
pages	O
or	O
out	O
of	O
some	O
ad	O
somewhere	O

i	O
want	O
to	O
trust	O
the	O
people	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
hear	O
in	O
the	O
newspa-	O
you	O
hear	O
on	O
the	O
t.	O
v.	O
and	O
you	O
read	O
the	O
newspaper	O
quite	O
often	O
of	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
do	O
n't	O
treat	O
or	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
your	O
kids	O
the	O
way	O
you	O
think	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
care	O
of	O

so	O
and	O
hope	O
to	O
never	O
get	O
into	O
that	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
find	O
somebody	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
trust	O
someone	O
with	O
the	O
welfare	O
of	O
our	O
children	O

and	O
hope	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
stay	O
in	O
this	O
situation	O
for	O
awhile	O

so	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

well	O
steven	O
it	O
's	O
been	O

well	O
ourselves	O
we	O
have	O
i	O
guess	O
never	O
had	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
child	O
care	O

our	O
kids	O
are	O
now	O
fourteen	O
and	O
eighteen	O

but	O
uh	O
and	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
go	O
back	O
those	O
many	O
years	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
very	O
much	O

and	O
we	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
looking	O
at	O
uh	O
two	O
family	O
income	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
our	O
kids	O
were	O
older	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
friends	O
of	O
ours	O
that	O
have	O
used	O
child	O
care	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

uh	O
so	O
it	O
my	O
involvement	O
has	O
n't	O
been	O
direct	O

but	O
still	O
have	O
been	O
you	O
know	O
certainly	O
exposed	O
to	O
criteria	O
people	O
are	O
using	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

right	O

right	O

well	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
friends	O
or	O
even	O
our	O
own	O
children	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
they	O
may	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
child	O
care	O

but	O
even	O
you	O
know	O
here	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
have	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
two	O
forms	O
of	O
uh	O
child	O
care	O

there	O
's	O
where	O
individuals	O
will	O
in	O
one	O
primarily	O
babysit	O
children	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
home	O

and	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
groups	O
of	O
anywhere	O
from	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
to	O
maybe	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
children	O

and	O
then	O
otherwise	O
there	O
will	O
be	O

the	O
majority	O
are	O
cooperative	O
day	O
cares	O

uh	O
people	O
form	O
a	O
co-op	O
and	O
uh	O
parents	O
will	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
co-op	O
and	O
put	O
a	O
fair	O
number	O
of	O
hours	O

frequently	O
they	O
will	O
hire	O
staff	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
day	O
care	O

and	O
the	O
emphasis	O
is	O
primarily	O
uh	O
someplace	O
for	O
the	O
children	O
to	O
be	O

but	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
there	O
's	O
some	O
fairly	O
good	O
training	O
programs	O

and	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
formal	O
two	O
year	O
programs	O
uh	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
is	O
some	O
definite	O
uh	O
creative	O
play	O
good	O
social	O
interaction	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
've	O
even	O
had	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
kinds	O
of	O
situations	O
publicized	O
here	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
are	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
typically	O
uh	O

whether	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
child	O
care	O
in	O
a	O
home	O
or	O
in	O
a	O
larger	O
situation	O
where	O
actually	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
of	O
an	O
institution	O

and	O
you	O
've	O
actually	O
got	O
children	O
that	O
most	O
people	O
would	O
consider	O
problem	O
children	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IP
not	C
and	C
it	C
's	C
more	O
of	O
a	O
group	O
home	O
rather	O
than	O
actually	O
day	O
care	O
type	O
of	O
facility	O

uh	O
so	O

okay	O

uh	O
before	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago	O
i	O
had	O
a	O
a	O
very	O
narrow	O
view	O
of	O
of	O
nursing	O
homes	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
uh	O
more	O
like	O
a	O
funeral	O
home	O

i	O
always	O
joked	O
around	O
about	O
it	O
being	O
a	O
funeral	O
home	O
and	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
then	C
i	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
volunteer	O
work	O
here	O
in	O
tyler	O
texas	O

and	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
one	O

and	O
it	O
just	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
activities	O
director	O

everyone	O
was	O
cheerful	O

and	O
now	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
such	O
a	O
bad	O
view	O
of	O
nursing	O
homes	O
anymore	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
certainly	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
send	O
my	O
parent	O
unless	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
absolute	O
last	O
re-	O
resort	O

um	O
i	O

a	O
sister	O

in	O

yeah	O

so	O
uh	O
she	O
she	O
's	O
real	O
interested	O
in	O
uh	O
what	O
ann	O
richards	O
has	O
been	O
doing	O

she	O
's	O
ann	O
richards	O
is	O
really	O
cracking	O
down	O
on	O
uh	O
the	O
nursing	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
you	O
would	O
n't	O

anything	O
about	O
a	O
texas	O

okay	O

ann	O
richards	O
is	O
our	O
governor	O
in	O
texas	O

and	O
she	O
's	O
really	O

down	O
on	O

and	O
what	O
goes	O
on	O
in	O

and	O
uh	O
my	O

of	O
the	O
really	O
nice	O
ones	O
that	O
really	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
their	O
people	O
are	O
so	O
expensive	O
because	O
because	O
they	O

the	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
really	O
going	O
to	O
care	O
for	O
the	O

um	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
the	O
last	O
several	O
years	O
of	O
his	O
life	O

and	O
someone	O
visited	O
him	O
everyday	O

my	O
grandmother	O
did	O

but	O
uh	O
if	O
she	O
could	O
n't	O
someone	O
visited	O
him	O
every	O
day	O

it	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
town	O
nursing	O
home	O

and	O
uh	O
people	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
paid	O
much	O
there	O
at	O
all	O

they	O
did	O
n't	O
care	O
about	O
what	O
went	O
on	O

they	O
would	O
let	O
a	O
let	O
a	O
patient	O
get	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
bed	O
sores	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
the	O
people	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
would	O
have	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
needs	O
that	O
would	O
n't	O
get	O
met	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
just	O
old	O
people	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
nurses	O
and	O
doctors	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
put	O
any	O
for-	O
forth	O
any	O
loving	O
care	O
for	O
them	O

right	O

right	O

um-hum	O

worn	O
down	O

feel	O
they	O
feel	O
pretty	O
helpless	O

is	O
it	O
uh	O
like	O

uh	O
do	O
you	O

a	O
large	O
firm	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

uh	O
i	O

for	O
a	O
fairly	O
large	O
company	O

it	O
's	O

eight	O

uh	O
we	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
4o-	O
-1k	O
plan	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
like	O
retirement	O

they	O
kind	O
of	O
match	O
up	O
to	O
you	O

if	O
you	O

six	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
bad	O

god	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

it	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

i	O

sure	O
it	O

not	O
till	O
like	O
twenty	O
five	O
years	O
thirty	O
years	O

yeah	O

huh	O
well	O
i	O
guess	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
f-	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
a	O
flex	O
benefits	O
plan	O
where	O
you	O
you	O
get	O
like	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
dollars	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
spend	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
cafeteria	O
of	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
or	O
need	O

otherwise	O
you	O
can	O
uh	O
guess	O
you	O
can	O
put	O
also	O
put	O
money	O
hold	O
money	O
back	O
and	O
then	O
either	O
use	O
it	O
or	O
lose	O
it	O
and	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
taxed	O
or	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
have	O
that	O
money	O
you	O
know	O
put	O
in	O
your	O
paycheck	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
depends	O
on	O
which	O
company	O
you	O
work	O
for	O

i	O
know	O
that	O
like	O
the	O
the	O
the	O
one	O
plan	O
that	O
everyone	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
in	O
my	O
place	O
is	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
uh	O
think	O
you	O
call	O
it	O
plan	O
d.	O

deductibles	O
are	O
really	O
high	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
fifteen	O
hundred	O
dollars	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
ones	O
you	O
're	O
paying	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
for	O
them	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
unlikely	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
f-	O
relatively	O
uh	O
healthy	O
then	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
unlikely	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
use	O
that	O
mu-	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
you	O

so	O
the	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
someone	O
did	O
start	O
a	O
cost	O
benefit	O
analysis	O

and	O
ends	O
up	O
the	O
best	O
is	O
they	O
take	O
a	O
high	O
deductible	O
and	O
and	O
take	O
a	O
loss	O
what-	O
whatever	O
happens	O

we	O

they	O
they	O

something	O

i	O
do	O

for	O

basically	O

what	O

yeah	O

uh	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
in	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O

it	O
when	O
they	O
're	O
just	O
trying	O
to	O
fill	O
in	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
i	O
do	O
too	O

yeah	O

you	O
may	O
find	O
one	O
little	O
uh	O
news	O
item	O
interesting	O

so	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
to	O
to	O
hear	O
about	O
it	O

yeah	O

actually	O
y-	O
you	O
mention	O
newsweek	O

i-	BE_IP
i-	C
i	O
do	O
like	O
uh	O
u._s.	O
news	O
and	O
world	O
report	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
to	O
read	O
it	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
i	O
like	O

but	O
that	BE
's	IP
i	C
think	C
that	C
's	C
a	C
good	O
magazine	O

yeah	O
oh	O
well	O
right	O
now	O
i	O
'm	O
trying	O
to	O
keep	O
abreast	O
of	O
uh	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
europe	O
you	O
know	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
uh	O
u._s._s._r.	O
's	O
satellites	O
breaking	O
off	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
become	O
independent	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
european	O
community	O
coming	O
together	O

that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
affect	O
our	O
uh	O
economy	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

oh	O
yeah	O

definitely	O
yeah	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
pretty	O
sure	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
uh	O
once	O
once	O
europe	O
becomes	O
unified	O
and	O
uh	O
their	O
economy	O
becomes	O
one	O
big	O
economy	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
uh	O
kind	O
of	O
hurting	O

yeah	O

definitely	O

oh	O
yeah	O
so	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
toehold	O

a	O
good	O
toehold	O

yeah	O

because	O
when	O
they	O
first	O
start	O
off	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
highly	O
protectionist	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i-	O
i	O
can	O
understand	O
their	O
viewpoint	O

they	O
're	O
just	O
they	O
're	O
starting	O
off	O

and	O
their	O
economy	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
weak	O

so	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
established	O
before	O
they	O
com-	O

yeah	O

totally	O

actually	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
into	O
sports	O

my	O
roommates	O
are	O

so	O
unfortunately	O
i	O
am	O
forced	O
to	O
watch	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
sports	O

yeah	O

we	O
have	O
to	O
fight	O
over	O
the	O
remote	O
control	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
anybody	O
pays	O
too	O
little	O

do	O
you	O
get	O
hit	O
up	O
for	O
local	O
taxes	O
there	O

oh	BE_IP
so	C
y-	O
y-	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
whole	O
smorgasbord	O

well	O
i-	BE_IP
i	C
actually	O
live	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
tax	O
free	O
or	O
die	O
uh-huh	O

no	O

actually	BE_IP
there	C
's	C
no	O
sales	O
tax	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
either	O

no	O

what	O
there	O
is	O
is	O
very	O
high	O
property	O
taxes	O
because	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
they	O
fund	O
schools	O
and	O
everything	O

the	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
i	O
work	O
in	O
massachusetts	O

so	O
they	O
they	O
hit	O
me	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
five	O
percent	O
there	O

yep	O

but	O
it	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
we	O

i-	O
it	O
's	O
only	O
a	O
state	O
taxes	O
no	O
local	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
five	O
percent	O
sales	O
tax	O

but	O
um	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
so	O
i	O
'm	O
paying	O
state	O
tax	O
even	O
though	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
live	O
here	O

but	O
at	O

on	O
things	O
like	O
stock	O
options	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
tax	O
me	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
too	O
bad	O

yeah	O
oh	BE
i-	IE
i-	IE
i	IE

where	O

you	O
kn-	O
you	O

there	O
are	O
things	O
government	O

better	O
you	O

i	O

government	O
does	O
a	O
better	O
space	O
program	O
than	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
private	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
things	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
tax	O
subsidies	O
to	O
tobacco	O
farmers	O
because	O
jesse	O
helms	O
wants	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

or	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
and	O
just	O
tremendous	O
amounts	O
of	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
much	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
service	O
debt	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
going	O
in	O
into	O
into	O
programs	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

they	O
are	O
they	O
are	O
fat	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
military	O
is	O
really	O
fat	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
the	O
h._e._w.	O
services	O
although	O
they	O
're	O
providing	O
necessary	O
services	O
have	O
too	O
much	O
fat	O
in	O
them	O

you	O
know	O
like	O
we	O

we	O
um	O
yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
we	O
we	O
spend	O
a	O
fortune	O
for	O
things	O
like	O
v._a.	O
hospitals	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
how	O
well	O
they	O
're	O
managed	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
we	O
're	O
getting	O
our	O
money	O
's	O
work	O
out	O
worth	O
out	O
of	O
there	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
going	O
into	O
into	O
bureaucrats	O

well	O
be-	O
between	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
reagan	O

yeah	O

the	O
great	O
communicator	O

oh	O
oh	O
yeah	O

they	O
think	O

oh	O
yeah	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
go	O
and	O
say	O
and	O
that	O
con-	O

congress	O
they	O
're	O
the	O
fault	O
for	O
it	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
is	O
it	O
's	O
tricky	O
though	O

because	O
like	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
they	O
say	O
oh	O
all	O
right	O
let	O
's	O
cut	O
the	O
military	O
budget	O

well	O
yeah	O

then	O
you	O
lose	O
half	O
your	O
jobs	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
you	O
lose	O

grotten	O
connecticut	O
goes	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
tricky	O
to	O
balance	O
that	O
stuff	O
off	O
because	O
then	O
you	O
hurt	O
you	O
know	O

if	O
the	O
if	O
those	O
if	O
people	O
lose	O
their	O
jobs	O
then	O
they	O
become	O
a	O
load	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
contributing	O
taxes	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
very	O
hard	O
to	O
say	O
you	O
know	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
cut	O

yes	O
who	O
who	O
are	O
n't	O
contributing	O

right	O

yeah	O

and	O
uh	O
in	O
our	O

right	O

but	O
what	O
's	O
very	O
funny	O
is	O
in	O
our	O
town	O
meeting	O
they	O
were	O
vo-	O

th-	O
this	O
this	O
guy	O
had	O
both	O
for	O
our	O
school	O
district	O
meeting	O
and	O
our	O
town	O
meeting	O
had	O
this	O
proposal	O
which	O
unfortunately	O
violates	O
new	O
hampshire	O
constitution	O
for	O
our	O
local	O
town	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
to	O
uh	O
have	O
you	O
have	O
people	O
line	O
item	O
their	O
taxes	O

they	O
say	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
this	O
and	O
this	O
and	O
this	O
and	O
this	O
and	O
this	O

course	O
the	O
only	O
problem	O
with	O
that	O
is	O
then	O
nobody	O
pays	O
for	O
the	O
necessary	O
services	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
use	O

yeah	O

no	O

i	O
would	O
tend	O
to	O
agree	O
very	O
highly	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
all	O
paying	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
too	O
much	O
taxes	O
and	O
not	O

come	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

yeah	O

we	O

here	O
in	O

uh	O
we	O
pay	O
county	O

it	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

we	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

which	O
is	O
probably	O
pretty	O
nice	O

but	O
i	O
'll	O
bet	O
that	O

your	O
state	O
sales	O

is	O
pretty	O
high	O

there	O

uh-huh	O

it	O

when	O

a	O

the	O
the	O
