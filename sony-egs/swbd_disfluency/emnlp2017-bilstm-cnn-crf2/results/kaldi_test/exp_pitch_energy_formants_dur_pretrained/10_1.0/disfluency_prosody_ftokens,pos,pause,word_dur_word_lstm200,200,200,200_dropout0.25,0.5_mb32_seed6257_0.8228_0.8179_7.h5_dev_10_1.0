yeah	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
budget	O

my	O
wife	O
and	O
i	O
grew	O
up	O
in	O
families	O
of	O
rather	O
modest	O
means	O

and	O
our	O
family	O
income	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
is	O
comfortable	O
upper	O
middle	O
class	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
might	O
say	O

and	O
we	O
're	O
both	O
so	O
frugal	O
that	O
i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
a	O
budget	O

we	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O
invest	O
the	O
money	O
and	O
go	O
on	O
vacations	O
and	O
always	O
never	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
any	O
money	O
problems	O
which	O
i	O
guess	O
is	O
a	O
comfortable	O
thing	O

well	O
we	O
stay	O
within	O
our	O
means	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
by	O
conscious	O
effort	O

they	O
're	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O
happens	O
automatically	O

although	O
we	O
just	O
moved	O
to	O
california	O

and	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
living	O
here	O
in	O
california	O
is	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
rather	O
pathological	O

housing	O
prices	O
are	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
from	O
four	O
to	O
ten	O
times	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
they	O
were	O
where	O
i	O
came	O
from	O
in	O
dallas	O

yeah	O

so	O
that	O
presents	O
a	O
real	O
shock	O

actually	O
our	O
standard	O
of	O
living	O
has	O
gone	O
down	O
somewhat	O
since	O
we	O
moved	O
to	O
california	O

it	O
's	O
god	O
's	O
country	O

and	O
one	O
way	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
god	O
can	O
afford	O
it	O

so	O
budget	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
problem	O
for	O
us	O

at	O
least	O
it	O
has	O
n't	O
been	O

let	O
me	O
maybe	O
at	O
this	O
point	O

but	O
up	O
until	O
this	O
morning	O
it	O
really	O
has	O
n't	O
been	O

but	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
undergraduate	O
school	O
a	O
long	O
long	O
time	O
ago	O
i	O
noted	O
that	O
the	O
monthly	O
salary	O
starting	O
average	O
monthly	O
saly	O
salary	O
for	O
engineers	O
that	O
in	O
my	O
discipline	O
was	O
like	O
oh	O
six	O
hundred	O
and	O
ten	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
noted	O
at	O
that	O
point	O
that	BE
i	IE
was	IP
you	C
know	C
if	C
that	C
's	C
what	O
my	O
salary	O
was	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
than	O
i	O
would	O
be	O
making	O
almost	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
my	O
father	O
made	O
during	O
his	O
best	O
year	O
ever	O

so	O
i	O
stopped	O
worrying	O
about	O
money	O

and	O

never	O
have	O
worried	O
about	O
money	O
since	O
then	O

sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O
you	O
know	O
because	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
manage	O
my	O
money	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
should	O

i	O
suppose	O
i	O
've	O
lost	O
money	O
on	O
not	O
taking	O
good	O
advantage	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
investments	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
both	O
lucky	O
in	O
that	O
regard	O
then	O

now	O
how	O
big	O
is	O
your	O
family	O

i	O
see	O

so	O

when	O
once	O
you	O
get	O
ten	O
children	O
though	O
you	O
may	O

so	O

i	O
have	O
two	O
kids	O

one	O
nine	O
and	O
one	O
thirteen	O

and	O
they	O
are	O
beginning	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
budget	O
problem	O
but	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
really	O
up	O
until	O
this	O
up	O
to	O
this	O
point	O

why	O
give	O
him	O
i	O
give	O
them	O
an	O
allowance	O

and	O
they	O

and	O
basically	O
give	O
my	O
son	O
ten	O
dollars	O
a	O
week	O

i	O
put	O
half	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
bank	O

i	O
give	BE_IP
give	C
him	O
the	O
other	O
half	O
in	O
cold	O
cash	O

and	O
he	O
has	O
a	O
teller	O
card	O
so	O
he	O
can	O
do	O
what	O
he	O
would	O
do	O
any	O
wishes	O
with	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
i	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
back	O

but	O
at	O
least	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
burning	O
on	O
his	O
pocket	O

if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
use	O
it	O
he	O
has	O
to	O
go	O
get	O
it	O

and	O
that	O
usually	O

oh	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
started	O

well	O
we	O
keep	O
a	O
budget	O
to	O
an	O
extent	O

and	O
really	O
we	O
really	O
were	O
forced	O
into	O
keeping	O
a	O
budget	O
because	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
paid	O
once	O
a	O
month	O
which	O
sort	BE
of	IP
sort	C
of	C
forces	O
some	O
restrictions	O

and	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
all	O
your	O
bills	O
are	O
paid	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
really	O
is	O
sort	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
keeping	O
a	O
budget	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
stay	O
within	BE
your	IP
within	C
your	C
means	O

yeah	O

yes	O

oh	O
you	O
move	O
from	O
dallas	O
to	O
san	O
francisco	O

that	O
is	O
a	O
huge	O
difference	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
have	O
good	O
sour	O
though	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
beautiful	O
place	O
to	O
live	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
system	O
too	O

well	O
then	O
again	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
said	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
are	O
able	O
to	O
take	O
trips	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
obviously	O
have	O
enough	O
to	O
live	O
on	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
're	O
indirectly	O
budgeting	O
just	O
by	BE_IP
by	C
the	O
fact	O
you	O
said	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
both	O
very	O
frugal	O
in	O
spending	O
the	O
money	O

so	O
i	O
mean	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
form	O
of	O
budgeting	O
i	O
would	O
think	O

it	O
's	O
kind	BE
of	IE
a	IP
kind	C
of	C
a	C
strange	O
topic	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
try	O
to	O
for	O
two	O
people	O
that	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
have	O
a	O
budget	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
budgeting	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
manage	O
their	O
money	O

yeah	O

well	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
have	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
way	O

my	O
wife	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
were	O
having	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
september	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
one	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

do	O
they	O
budget	O
at	O
all	O

i	O
mean	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
them	O
on	O
an	O
allowance	O

yeah	O

well	O
actually	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
texas	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
i	O
agree	O
with	O

yeah	O

i	O
would	O
n't	O
say	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
that	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
ago	O

when	O
i	O
was	O
younger	O
i	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sign	O
of	O
a	O
civilized	O
society	O
if	O
you	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
capital	O
punishment	O

maybe	O
slowly	O
changing	O
my	O
opinion	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
thoroughly	O
opposed	O
to	O

i	O
still	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
true	O
that	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
more	O
civilized	O
society	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
use	O
capital	O
punishment	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
beginning	O
to	O
believe	O
this	O
is	O
less	O
civilized	O
society	O
than	O
i	O
thought	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
certainly	O
do	O
n't	O
advocate	O
turning	O
people	O
like	O
that	O
loose	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
executing	O
and	O
does	O
anymore	O
than	O
keeping	O
them	O
in	O
jail	O

but	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
factor	O

yeah	O

the	O
cost	O
is	O
something	O

but	O
it	BE
's	IP
i	C
think	C
it	C
's	C
relatively	O
unimportant	O
compared	O
to	O
what	O
's	O
the	O
most	O
effective	O
way	O
of	O
dealing	O
with	O
crime	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
would	O
like	O

the	O
european	O
countries	O
certainly	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
have	O
capital	O
punishment	O

and	O
they	BE
do	IE
n't	IE
have	IP
they	C
do	C
n't	C
have	C
a	O
crime	O
problem	O
either	O

yeah	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
execute	O
anybody	O
in	O
britain	O
or	O
france	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
believe	O
they	O
do	O
in	O
germany	O
or	O
italy	O
either	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
crime	O
problems	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
relationship	O
between	O
the	O
two	O

i	O
guess	O
what	O
worries	O
me	O
about	O
capital	O
punishment	O
is	O
when	O
i	O
see	O
people	O
enthusiastic	O
about	O
it	O
and	O
sort	O
of	O
bloodthirsty	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
brings	O
out	O
the	O
worst	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
people	O
who	O
do	O
the	O
punishing	O

and	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
bothers	O
me	O

but	O

well	O
actually	O
it	O
was	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
that	O
bothers	O
me	O
is	O
when	O
it	O
becomes	O
a	O
political	O
issue	O
because	O
i	BE
do	IE
n't	IE
really	IE
think	IE
it	IP
i	C_IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
really	C
think	C
it	C
's	C
us	O
very	O
important	O
aspect	O
of	O
fighting	O
crime	O
or	O
law	O
and	O
order	O
or	O
anything	O
else	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
just	O
becomes	O
a	O
symbolic	O
i	O
'm	O
tougher	O
than	O
you	O
are	O
type	O
emotional	O

for	O

so	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
settled	O
once	O
for	O
all	O
and	O
get	O
in	O
the	O
background	O
while	O
the	O
more	O
important	O
issues	O
get	O
discussed	O

like	O
i	O
say	O
some	O
years	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
place	O
for	O
capital	O
punishment	O
in	O
the	O
civilized	O
western	O

no	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
not	O
so	O
sure	O
that	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
would	O
n't	O
vote	O
against	O
somebody	O
just	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
for	O
capital	O
punishment	O
and	O
nor	BE_IP
nor	C
the	O
other	O
way	O
around	O

i	O
guess	O
some	O

my	O
view	O
of	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
beginning	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
that	O
's	O
simply	O
not	O
rehabilitatable	O
and	O
that	O
cost	O
and	O
other	O
factors	O
justify	O
executing	O
people	O

maybe	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
a	O
symbolic	O
gesture	O
that	O
than	O
anything	O
else	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
also	O
never	O
been	O
a	O
victim	O
although	O
i	O
think	O
i	O
have	O
two	O
friends	O
whose	O
wives	O
were	O
murder	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
can	O
imagine	O
that	O
for	O
some	O
people	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
only	O
form	O
of	O
justice	O
in	O
that	O
case	O

oh	O
really	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
believe	O
in	O
it	O

you	O
sound	O
like	O
a	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
a	O
girl	O
i	O
hang	O
out	O
with	O

she	O
has	O
very	O
very	O
black	O

white	O

you	O

no	O
gray	O
in	O
her	O
opinions	O
you	O
know	O

she	BE_IP
she	C
probably	O
would	O
agree	O
more	O
with	O
you	O

but	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
would	O
rather	O
person	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
be	O
put	O
down	O
than	O
give	O
them	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
and	O
do	O
it	O
again	O

i	O
've	O
never	O
had	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
punishment	O
or	O
a	O
crime	O
like	O
a	O
murder	O
touch	O
my	O
immediate	O
family	O
but	O
i	O
still	O
feel	O
very	O
strongly	O
that	O
capital	O
punishment	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
punish	O
especially	O
criminals	O
who	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
absolutely	O
no	O
remorse	O
for	O
what	O
they	O
've	O
done	O

and	O
we	O
see	O
that	O
more	O
and	O
more	O

in	O
our	O
state	O
right	O
now	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
fourteen	O
year	O
old	O
boy	O
who	O
raped	O
and	O
then	O
killed	O
a	O
seven	O
year	O
old	O
girl	O
yeah	O
that	O
's	O
fourteen	O
years	O
old	O

what	O
is	O
he	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
when	O
he	O
turns	O
into	O
an	O
adult	O

yeah	O

but	O
it	O
costs	O
less	O

and	O
yeah	O

it	O
is	O

i	O
mean	O
i	BE
work	IP
and	C
i	C
pay	C
my	O
taxes	O

and	O
i	O
lived	O
down	O
in	O
texas	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
while	O

and	O
they	O
're	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
heavy	O
state	O
compared	O
to	O
georgia	O

i	O
mean	O
you	O
guys	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
a	O
lot	O
more	O
for	BE_IP
to	C
each	O
his	O
own	O
even	O
than	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
georgia	O

even	O
in	O

that	O
's	O
the	O

somebody	O
for	O
nothing	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
pull	O
the	O

but	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

what	O
's	O
making	O
you	O
become	O
more	O
convinced	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
of	O
punishment	O

yeah	O

oh	O
gosh	O

yeah	O
oh	O
yeah	O

if	O
it	O
ever	O
touched	O
my	O

oh	O

you	O
know	O
actually	O
in	O
this	O
modern	O
day	O
and	O
age	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
we	O
have	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
leisure	O
time	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
so	O
many	O
convenience	O
appliances	O
and	O
whatnot	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
have	O
to	O
cook	O
dinner	O
anymore	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
heard	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
this	O
for	O
a	O
fact	O
but	O
i	O
've	O
heard	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
families	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
spend	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
together	O

the	O
kids	O
may	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
average	O
get	O
something	O
like	O
thirty	O
seconds	O
of	O
quality	O
time	O
with	O
the	O
parents	O

it	O
seems	O
bizarre	O
to	O
me	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
quite	O
understand	O
it	O
although	O
i	O
think	O
probably	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
worst	O
thing	O
that	O
's	O
happening	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
modern	O
world	O
today	O
is	O
television	O

not	O
so	O
much	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
bad	O
per	O
se	O
although	O
there	O
's	O
some	O
pretty	O
crappy	O
programming	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
some	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
poorer	O
lifestyles	O
illustrated	O
but	O
simply	O
because	O
it	O
dominates	O
so	O
much	O
discussionary	O
time	O

so	O
darned	O
easy	O
to	O
tend	O
to	O
thing	O
on	O

so	O
i	O
refuse	O
to	O
have	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
house	O

yeah	O

i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O

television	O
sure	O
makes	O
child	O
rearing	O
easy	O
on	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
mean	O
the	O
kids	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
real	O
pest	O

and	O
turning	O
the	O
t	O
v	O
on	O
is	O
almost	O
like	O
magic	O
you	O
know	O

like	O
sticking	O
an	O
electrode	O
into	O
their	O
pleasure	O
center	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
them	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
too	O
good	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
take	O
advantage	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
to	O
spend	O
with	O
the	O
kids	O

but	O
i	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
dinner	O
time	O

we	O
always	O
eat	O
together	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
whenever	O
you	O
with	O
your	O
kids	O
you	O
wanna	BE_IP
interact	C
with	O
them	O
rather	O
than	O
just	O
ignore	O
them	O

i	O
guess	O
our	O
big	O
outlet	O
as	O
music	O
or	O
a	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
son	O
plays	O
violin	O

and	O
our	O
nine	O
year	O
old	O
daughter	O
plays	O
cello	O
and	O
when	O
our	O
son	O
started	O
playing	O
violin	O
i	O
took	O
up	O
violin	O

and	O
when	O
our	O
daughter	O
's	O
playing	O
cello	O
i	O
took	O
up	O
cello	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
plenty	BE
of	IP
plenty	C
of	C
interactive	O
time	O
in	BE
practicing	IP
although	C
neither	C
kid	O
likes	O
to	O
practice	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
big	O
surprise	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
imagine	O
with	O
infants	O
you	O
are	O
most	O
of	O
your	O
time	O
is	O
sort	O
of	O
spent	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
rather	O
than	O
interacting	O
with	O
them	O

oh	O
you	O
know	O
reading	O
is	O
so	O
good	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
took	O
great	O
pleasure	O
in	O
reading	O
to	O
my	O
kids	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
little	O

and	O
i	O
still	O
try	O
to	O
read	O
to	O
them	O
although	O
our	O
son	O
is	O
not	O
liking	O
that	O
anymore	O

but	O
i	O
read	O
you	O
know	O

there	O
's	O
this	O
doctor	O
seuss	O
sleep	O
book	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
seen	O
that	O
yet	O

it	O
's	O
called	O
a	O
sleep	O
book	O

and	O
you	O
ought	O
to	O
get	O
it	O

i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O
i	O
read	O
that	O
book	O
to	O
my	O

so	O
many	O
times	O
i	O
always	O

the	O

my	O
favorite	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

so	O
how	O
much	O

you	O

you	O
spend	O
with	O
your	O
kids	O
on	O
the	O
average	O
per	O
each	O
day	O

well	O
that	O
's	O

's	O
for	O

of	O
people	O
about	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
've	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

good	O
times	O

book	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
a	BE_IP
quite	C
a	C
few	O
of	O
doctor	O
seuss	O
but	O

oh	O
really	O

yeah	O

i	O
liked	O
it	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

they	O
enjoy	O
reading	O

i	BE
've	IP
actually	C
i	C
never	C
read	O
a	O
lot	O
growing	O
up	O

and	O
i	O
never	O
to	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
ago	O

i	O
just	O
started	O
picking	O
up	O
books	O

so	O
i	O
found	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
important	O
to	O
me	O
to	BE
get	IP
to	C
read	C

i	O
like	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
in	O
a	O
book	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
've	O
put	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
emphasis	O
on	BE
that	IP
on	C
my	C
kids	O
to	O
try	O
it	O

oh	O
i	O
probably	O
spend	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
two	O

my	O
wife	O
works	O
at	O
night	O

so	O
she	O
does	O
tupperware	O

so	O
she	O
's	O
gone	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
nights	O

so	O
i	O
spend	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
with	O
them	O

they	O
're	O
two	O
and	O
one	O

yeah	O

so	O
what	O
things	O
do	O
you	O
consider	O
an	O
invasion	O
of	O
privacy	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

how	O
old	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
think	O
about	O

i	O
was	O
thinking	O
of	O
like	O

i	O
started	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
all	O
the	O
big	O
you	O
know	O
data	O
bases	O
they	O
have	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
information	O
about	BE
your	IP
on	C
them	C
like	O
the	O
credit	O
reports	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
all	O
those	O
you	O
know	O
demographics	O
studies	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
have	O
who	O
knows	O
how	O
much	O
you	O
know	O
stuff	O
about	O
all	O
the	O
purchases	O
that	O
you	O
've	O
made	O
and	O
everything	O
kept	O
tract	O
somewhere	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
the	O
stuff	O
actually	O
what	O
they	O
actually	O
have	O
in	O
there	O

but	O
i	BE
know	IE
they	IE
use	IE
it	IP
i	C_IE
mean	C_IE
they	C_IP
they	C
sell	O
those	O

yeah	O

that	BE
was	IE
though	IP
that	C
was	C
the	O
other	O
one	O
i	O
was	O

i	O

that	O
's	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
know	O
drugs	O
are	O
illegal	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i	BE
think	IE
the	IP
i	C
think	C
that	C
you	O
know	O
a	O
person	O
's	O
competence	O
should	O
be	O
more	O
determined	O
by	O
you	O

their	O
actions	O
and	O
their	O
behavior	O

and	O
if	BE
they	IE
're	IP
you	C
know	C
if	C
they	C
're	C
on	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
know	O

substance	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
takes	O
away	O
from	O
the	O

of	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
supervisor	O
or	O
manager	O
type	O
person	O
you	O
know	O
who	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
evaluate	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
evaluated	O
that	O
way	O
rather	O
than	BE_IP
with	C
you	O
know	O
a	O
chemical	O
you	O
know	O

people	O
that	O
are	O
carriers	O
and	O
do	BE
n't	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
reveal	O
it	O

that	O
would	O
be	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
extreme	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
've	O
heard	O
of	O
things	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
making	O
them	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
marking	O
them	O
somehow	O
or	BE_IP
you	C

or	C
something	O
like	O
that	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
putting	O
them	O
all	O
someplace	O
like	O
in	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
borders	O
and	O
we	BE
're	IP
i	C
mean	C
what	C
do	C
you	C
value	O
more	O
the	O
invasion	O
of	O
a	O
person	O
's	O
privacy	O
or	O
the	O
possible	O
danger	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
other	O
people	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
that	BE
's	IE
always	IP
that	C
's	C
been	C
the	O
big	O
role	O
of	O
government	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
mean	O
generally	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

oh	O
yeah	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
difficult	O
one	O
to	O
go	O
into	O

i	O
mean	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
particular	O
case	O

because	O
i	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
i	O
mean	O
they	O
could	O
require	O
you	O
know	O
oh	O
obligatory	O
aids	O
testing	O
for	O
everyone	O
because	O
i	BE
'm	IP
you	C
know	C
there	C
's	C
a	O
huge	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
population	O

a	O
huge	O
part	O
but	O
no	O
the	O
aids	O
population	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
habit	O
that	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
they	O
do	O
are	O
spreading	O
it	O

but	O
again	O
to	O
require	O
you	O
know	O
such	O
a	O
test	O
and	BE
this	IP
and	C
then	C
to	O
make	BE_IP
make	C
it	O
and	O
then	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
just	C
a	C
subject	O
them	O
just	O
to	O
discriminate	O
discriminatory	O
practices	O
and	O
other	O
things	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
exactly	O
i	O
feel	O
about	O
that	O

well	O

well	O
what	O
about	O
require	O
drug	O
testing	O
as	O
a	O
condition	O
of	O
employment	O

oh	O
of	O
course	O
the	O
subtle	O
thing	O
actually	O

i	O
have	O
worked	O
at	O
texas	O
instruments	O

and	O
they	O
instituted	O
a	O
drug	O
policy	O
their	O
drug	O
testing	O
policy	O
where	O
they	O
randomly	O
would	O
test	O
employees	O
and	O
actually	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
truth	O
i	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
much	O
about	O
it	O

that	O
had	O
you	O
know	O

really	O
did	O
n't	O
relate	O
to	O
me	O

but	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
things	O
that	O
people	O
thought	O
out	O
like	O
well	O
what	O
happens	O
if	O
they	O
get	O
a	O
false	O
positive	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
recourse	O
do	O
you	O
have	O

and	O
also	O
this	O
is	O
the	BE_IP
against	C
the	C
law	O
for	O
the	O
government	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
big	O
brother	O
activity	O

and	O
yet	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
these	O
large	O
corporations	O
such	O
as	O
texas	O
instruments	O
although	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
admit	O
to	O
it	O
it	O
's	O
actually	O
drug	O
testing	O
policy	O
comes	O
about	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
in	O
government	O
pressure	O

so	O
well	O
what	O
that	O
means	O
is	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
really	O
is	O
the	O
government	O
this	O
requiring	O
this	O

although	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
actually	O
execute	O
it	O
themselves	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
the	O
government	O

so	O
in	O
that	O
sense	O
at	O
least	O
philosophically	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
borderline	O
legal	O

well	O
what	O
about	O
this	O
aids	O
epidemic	O
now	O

you	O
find	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
certain	O
people	O
actually	O
criminal	O
in	O
their	O
disregard	O
for	O
others	O

yeah	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
the	O
ultimate	O
solution	O
is	O
to	O
operate	O
on	O
their	O
brains	O
so	O
that	O
it	O

it	O
destroys	O
their	O
libido	O

now	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
they	O

so	O
what	O
about	O
that	O
is	O
an	O
invasion	O
of	O
privacy	O

so	O
really	O

and	O
it	O
gets	O
to	O
balancing	O
personal	O
freedom	O
against	O
the	O
general	O
welfare	O
that	O
society	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
them	O

growing	O

chop	O
their	O
weenies	O
off	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
public	O
service	O
is	O
a	O
worthy	O
thing	O

and	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O
there	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
programs	O
such	O
as	O
peace	O
corps	O
that	O
promote	O
that	O

probably	O
the	O
most	O
popular	O
one	O
but	O
one	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
typically	O
recognized	O
as	O
such	O
is	O
the	O
boy	O
scouts	O

i	O
know	O
that	O
because	O
my	O
son	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
the	O

is	O
posed	O
somewhat	O
strangely	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
talking	O
about	O
a	O

and	O
of	O

as	BE
a	IP
as	C
a	C
voluntary	O
activity	O

of	O
course	O
military	O
service	O
falls	O
under	O
the	O
category	O
of	O
public	O

and	O
so	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
would	O
fulfill	O
the	BE_IP
at	C

the	C
nominal	O

in	O
the	O

or	O

but	O
i	O
agree	O
that	O
probably	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
what	O
was	O

there	O
are	O
other	O
things	O
such	O
as	O
civil	O

which	O
many	O

are	O

i	O
suspect	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
in	O

either	O

a	O

oh	O

that	O

oh	O
no	O

to	O

well	O
it	O
depends	O
on	O
whether	BE
you	IP
whether	C
we	C

that	O

okay	O

right	O

but	O
i	O

that	O
might	O
be	O

to	O
something	O

the	O

it	BE

it	C_IP
it	C

you	O

whether	O
i	O

that	O

you	O

while	O
we	O

before	O
they	O

you	O

that	O
this	O
is	O
what	O

and	O
then	O
if	O
you	O

it	O
why	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
'll	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
look	O
for	O
a	O

well	O
i	O
suppose	O
you	O
're	O
right	O
there	O
too	O
you	O
know	O

personally	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
suppose	O
they	O
fired	O
and	O
everything	O
right	O
then	O

well	O
what	O
do	O
they	O
do	O
with	O
you	O
guys	O
if	O
they	BE_IP
you	C
guys	O
get	O

oh	O
i	BE_IP
oh	C
i	C
see	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
either	O

i	O
would	O
n't	O
even	O
think	O
about	O
it	O

i	O
think	O
anybody	O
that	O
does	O
them	O
are	O
dumb	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
stupid	O

you	O
just	O
watch	O
it	O
on	O
t	O
v	O
and	O
see	O
how	O
it	O
just	O
burns	O
your	O
brain	O
completely	O
up	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

really	O
dumb	O

but	O
i	O
see	O

what	O
else	O
was	O
i	O
gonna	O
say	O
here	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
so	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
all	O
should	O
test	O
really	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
just	O
seems	O
like	O
there	O
's	O
so	O
much	O
more	O
of	O
it	O
going	O
on	O
anymore	O
but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
wrong	O
with	O
the	O
people	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
government	O
should	O
do	O
something	O
about	O
stopping	O
it	O
completely	O
about	O
it	O
coming	O
into	O
our	O
country	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
just	O
slap	O
somebody	O
's	O
little	O
hand	O

you	O
know	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
that	O
again	O

and	O
then	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
get	O
out	O

and	O
they	O
are	O
right	O
back	O
at	O
it	O
again	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

but	O
other	O
than	O
that	O
way	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

like	O
i	O
say	O
maybe	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
days	O
i	O
'll	O
get	O
a	O
job	O
because	O
i	O
am	O
looking	O
still	O
for	O
a	O
part-time	O
job	O
you	O
know	O
since	O
my	O
company	O
went	O
bankrupt	O

see	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
like	O
i	O
say	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
would	O
n't	O
care	O
because	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
do	IE
n't	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
even	O
smoke	O

so	O
they	O
can	O
test	O
me	O
all	O
i	O
want	O

i	O
wonder	O
what	O
those	O
deaths	O
if	O
you	O
take	O
medicine	O
if	O
that	O
would	O
affect	O
it	O

see	O
now	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
would	O
be	O
really	O
unfair	O
then	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

find	O
out	O
what	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
medication	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
would	O
affect	O
it	O
and	O
everything	O

but	O
well	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
all	O
we	O
can	O
talk	O
about	O

i	O
think	O
our	O
five	O
minutes	O
is	O
about	O
up	O
anyhow	O

okay	O
lewis	O

maybe	O
i	O
'll	O
talk	O
to	O
you	O
again	O

alrighty	O

bye-bye	O

hi	O

sort	O
of	O

i	BE
'm	IE
a	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	C
student	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
a	O
national	O
guard	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
drug	O
testing	O

yeah	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
do	O
it	O
before	O
you	O
go	O
rent	O

and	O
occasionally	O
they	O
'll	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
random	O
urinalysis	O

yeah	O

so	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
be	O
smoking	O
marijuana	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
the	O
military	O
anymore	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

i	O
believe	O
they	O
should	O
too	O

uh-huh	O

definitely	O

but	O
actually	O
yeah	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
randomly	O
otherwise	O
people	O
cheap	O

i	O
know	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
doing	O
my	O
basic	O
training	O
in	O
a	BE_IP
i	C_IE

there	C

and	O
then	O
when	O
that	O
urinalysis	O
came	O
around	O
it	O
'd	O
be	O
all	O
scared	O

so	O
it	O
does	O
work	O

it	O
is	O
effective	O

the	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O

done	O
drugs	O
but	O
you	O
've	O

of	C
hard	O

yeah	O

we	O
get	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
part	O

if	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

oh	O
i	O

yeah	O

right	O
now	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
too	O

so	O
that	O
the	O
risk	O

it	O
for	O
them	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

oh	O
see	O
that	O
's	O

is	O
a	O
problem	O

sometimes	O
some	O

a	O

i	BE

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C

been	O
here	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O

before	O
that	O
we	O
lived	O
in	O
colorado	O

but	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
colorado	O
it	O
's	O
real	O
noticeable	O

i	O
mean	O
you	BE
can	IE
just	IE
few	IP
i	C
mean	C
i	C
can	C
just	C
sense	C

i	O

we	O
have	O
a	O
neighborhood	O

program	O
in	O
the	BE
house	IP
the	C
development	C
that	O
we	O
live	O
in	O
which	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
reduce	O
home	O
theft	O
burglary	O
and	O
things	O
of	O
that	O
sort	O

do	O
you	O
have	O
that	O

um-hum	O

no	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
also	O
i	O
've	O
heard	O
that	O
the	O
newest	O
thing	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
are	O
specializing	O
in	O
robbing	O
people	O
during	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
're	O
home	O
like	O
on	O
the	O
weekends	O

a	O
high	O
percentage	O
of	O
free	O
time	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
fifty	O
percent	O
and	O
most	O
people	O
's	O
free	O
time	O
is	O
spent	O
doing	O
yard	O
work	O
outdoors	O

so	O
they	O
wait	O
while	O
you	O
're	O
outs	BE_IP
outdoors	C

they	O
know	O
the	O
houses	O
unlock	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
just	O
slip	O
in	O
slip	O
in	O
slip	O
out	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
know	O
exactly	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
for	O

so	O
i	O
've	O
heard	O
that	O
is	O
really	O
on	O
the	O
rise	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
new	O
type	O
of	O
crime	O

yeah	O

unfortunately	O
yes	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

it	O
helps	O
to	O
know	O
your	O
neighbors	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
give	O
you	O

you	O
're	O
supposed	O
to	O
make	O
lists	O
of	O
car	O

i	O
know	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
my	O
neighbors	O
right	O
around	O
my	O
development	O
if	O
i	O
see	O
a	O
car	O
that	O
's	O
unfamiliar	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
have	O
a	O
list	O

is	O
that	O
what	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
did	O
and	O
your	O
program	O
where	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
license	O
plates	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

i	O
mean	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
hate	O
to	O
be	O
parent	O

but	O
they	O
're	O
really	O
only	O
so	O
many	O
things	O
you	O
can	O
do	O

you	O
can	O
have	O
a	O
house	O
alarm	O
neighborhood	O
watch	O
program	O
you	O
know	O
as	O
a	O
woman	O
not	O
go	O
out	O
at	O
night	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
which	O
is	O
what	O
i	O
choose	O
to	O
do	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
not	O

if	O
you	O
kill	O
someone	O
in	O
your	O
home	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
there	O
in	O
your	O
home	O
it	O
's	O
considered	O
self-defense	O
though	O

it	O
is	O
n't	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

really	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
you	O
had	O
a	O
handgun	O
though	O
in	O
other	O
words	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
premeditated	O
you	O
had	O
a	O
hand	O
gun	O
at	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
someone	O
's	O
down	O

well	O
minneapolis	O
is	O
n't	O
too	O
bad	O

i	O
know	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
been	O
some	O
increases	O
and	O
crime	O
lately	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
murders	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
gone	O
up	O
in	O
scale	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
some	O
other	O
things	O

i	O
personally	O
had	O
an	O
a	O
little	O
experience	O
the	O
other	O
day	O

somebody	O
broke	O
my	O
passenger	O
window	O
and	O
stole	O
a	O
uniform	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
truck	O

but	O
actually	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
look	O
at	BE_IP
at	C
minneapolis	O
as	O
compared	O
to	O
where	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
live	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
better	O
because	O
i	O
came	O
from	O
florida	O

and	O
in	O
orlando	O
there	BE
's	IP
crime	C
is	C
getting	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
bigger	O
problem	O
than	O
ever	O

what	O
part	O
of	O
california	O
so	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
a	O
shame	O
when	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
constrain	O
your	O
activities	O

well	O
interestingly	O
enough	O
right	O
before	O
i	O
moved	O
up	O
here	O

i	O
'm	O
an	O
intern	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
go	O
back	O
down	O
in	O
may	O

but	O
in	O
orlando	O
before	O
i	O
moved	O
up	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
real	O
problem	O
with	O
it	O

we	O
'd	O
been	O
broken	O
into	BE_IP
in	C
my	O
apartment	O
about	O
four	O
times	O
two	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
weeks	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
helped	O
organize	O
was	O
a	O
neighborhood	O
watch	O
type	O
situation	O
down	O
there	O

because	O
they	O
were	O
just	O

it	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
where	O
the	O
new	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
operate	O
in	O
the	O
daylight	O
because	O
everybody	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
houses	O
were	O
left	O
unguarded	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
given	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
pretty	O
conscientious	O
about	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
work	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
neighborhood	O
watch	O

oh	O
is	O
that	O
right	O

that	O
's	O
amazing	O

it	O
almost	O
seems	O
like	O
they	O
're	O
getting	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
smarter	O

really	O

yeah	O

unfortunately	O
starting	O
to	O
really	O
you	O
know	O
look	O
at	O
people	O
's	O
habits	O
and	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
a	O
particular	O
points	O
of	O
the	O
day	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
guys	O
i	O
work	O
with	O
really	O
laughs	O
when	O
he	O
looks	O
at	O
minneapolis	O
because	O
he	O
's	O
from	O
detroit	O
and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
crime	O
level	O
there	O
of	O
course	O
it	O
's	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
pronounced	O
but	O
yeah	O

i	O
think	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
neighborhood	O
watch	O
program	O
here	O
in	O
minneapolis	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
sure	O

pretty	O
much	O

i	BE
was	IP
i	C
was	C
basically	O
involved	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
organization	O
of	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
left	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O

sure	O
where	O
it	O
went	O
from	O
there	O

yeah	O

but	O
that	O
whole	O
thing	O
of	O
being	O
alert	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
noticing	O
your	O
surroundings	O
noticing	O
people	O
who	O
look	O
suspicious	O
activities	O
like	O
that	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
frustrating	O
things	O
about	O
that	BE
is	IP
that	C
you	C
really	O
are	O
limited	O
even	O
even	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
threat	O
is	O
there	O
it	O
's	O
against	O
the	O
law	O
to	O
set	O
traps	O

it	O
's	O
against	O
the	O
law	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
could	O
basically	O

when	O
i	O
was	O
getting	O
robbed	O
down	O
in	O
florida	O
i	O
was	O
really	O
considering	O
electrifying	O
doors	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
like	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
miami	O
that	O
time	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
always	O
true	O

no	O

there	BE
was	IP
there	C
was	C
a	O
case	O
about	O
two	O
years	O
ago	O
where	O
a	O
guy	O
knew	O
he	O
was	BE
gonna	IP
get	C
robbed	C

and	O
essentially	O
what	O
he	O
's	O
done	O
is	O
setup	O
elect	O
electrocution	O
trap	O
for	O
the	O
burglar	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
home	O

the	O
guy	O
came	O
in	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
home	O

and	O
sure	O
enough	O
he	O
fell	O
into	O
the	O
trap	O
and	O
was	O
severely	O
burned	O

he	O
did	O
n't	O
die	O

he	O
was	O
severely	O
burned	O

he	O
took	O
the	O
guy	O
to	O
court	O
and	O
one	O
a	O
settlement	O

yeah	O

so	O
that	BE
really	IP
that	C
makes	C
you	O
think	O
you	O
know	O

like	O
your	O
hands	O
are	O
very	O
much	O
time	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
should	O
say	O
something	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
the	O
least	O
informed	O

this	O
is	O
totally	O
accidental	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
this	O
topic	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
on	O
the	O
least	O
informed	O
person	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
united	O
states	O

this	O
is	O
not	O
been	O
determined	O
yet	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
've	C
never	O
read	O
a	O
newspaper	O
in	O
my	O
entire	O
life	O

and	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
never	O
watch	O
t	O

nor	O
listen	O
to	O
the	O

unless	O

and	O
they	O

it	O

i	BE
've	IP
i	C_IE

with	O

people	O

they	O
've	O
tried	O
to	O
lock	O
me	O
up	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
basically	O
not	O
interested	O

and	O
i	O
also	O
find	O
the	O
everything	O
is	O
so	O
slick	O
and	O
superficial	O
and	O
misguided	O
and	O
miss	O
and	O
off	O
the	O

what	O
am	O
i	O
trying	O
to	O
say	O

i	O
do	O
learn	O
about	O
things	O
largely	O
from	O
friends	O

and	O
i	O
occasionally	O
will	O
read	O
something	O
like	O
the	O
new	O
york	O
review	O
of	O
books	O

you	O
know	O
someone	O
write	O
a	O
book	O
about	O
something	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
'll	O
learn	O
all	O
about	O
this	O
thing	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
news	O
two	O
years	O
earlier	O

and	O
somehow	O

and	O
anything	O
i	O
participated	O
in	O
a	O

about	O
when	O
i	O
read	O
about	O
in	O
the	O
paper	O
is	O
always	O
so	O
covered	O
from	O
such	O
a	O
funny	O
and	O
superficial	O
perspective	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
much	O
confidence	O
in	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
that	O
i	O
'm	O
lazy	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
he	O
just	O
for	O
the	O
record	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
totally	O
concede	O
that	O
intelligent	O
people	O
read	O
these	O
things	O
intelligent	O
people	O

them	O

but	O
i	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
being	O
elitist	O
in	O
that	O
sense	O
i	O
hope	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

by	O
the	O
way	O
when	O
you	O
say	O
most	O
people	O
think	O
it	O
is	O

i	O

it	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
did	O
on	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
supreme	O

the	BE_IP
for	O
the	O
whole	O
business	O
of	O

i	O
actually	O
have	O
a	O

that	O
thomas	O
and	O
the	O
anita	O

business	O

i	O
mean	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
the	O
closest	O
thing	O

i	O
deeply	O
cared	O
about	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
sort	O
of	O
had	O
plans	O
to	O
have	O
dinner	O
with	O
a	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O

and	O
when	O
i	O
arrived	O
at	O
her	O
house	O
she	O
was	O
engrossed	O
in	O
it	O

we	O
ended	O
up	O
watching	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
hours	O
zooming	O
out	O
and	O
grabbing	O
something	O
to	O
eat	O
and	O
then	O
zooming	O
back	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
watching	O
it	O
some	O
more	O

and	O
i	O
thought	O
that	O
was	O
terrific	O
because	O
she	O
actually	O
helped	O
me	O
understand	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O

but	O
even	O
then	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
end	O
up	O
doing	O
it	O
on	O
my	O
own	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

you	O
ever	O
read	O

any	O
particular	O
reason	O

yeah	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
this	O
is	O
sort	O
of	O
consumer	O
report	O
phenomenon	O
which	O
is	O
everybody	O
that	O
i	O
know	O
reads	O
consumer	O
reports	O
are	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
do	O
feel	O
that	O
consumer	O
reports	O
does	O
a	O
wholly	O
inadequate	O
job	O
in	O
their	O
area	O
of	O
particular	O
interest	O
but	O
assumes	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
a	O
reasonable	O
job	O
in	O
other	O
areas	O
without	O
thinking	O
that	O
there	O

people	O
in	O
who	O
think	O
each	O
other	O
areas	O
area	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
specialty	O

i	O
guess	O
you	O
could	O
explain	O
it	O
two	O
ways	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O
cynical	O
view	O
is	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
are	O
n't	O
doing	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
job	O
at	O
all	O

and	O
the	O
view	O
that	O
i	O
'd	O

take	O

that	O
there	O
's	O
a	O

i	O
had	O
i	O

that	O
kind	O
of	O

with	O

and	O
afterwards	O
decided	O
that	O
what	O
i	O
'd	O
gotten	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
just	O
was	O
n't	O
worth	O
the	O
time	O
i	O
put	O
in	O
these	O
things	O
are	O
just	O
very	O
slow	O
ways	O
of	O
seeing	O
information	O
come	O
out	O

what	O
did	O
you	O
go	O
ahead	O
first	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O

similar	O
to	O
what	O
we	O
're	O
doing	O
is	O
budgeting	O

a	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
take	O
into	O
consideration	O
with	O
the	O
bills	O
are	O
and	O
what	O
's	O
extra	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
do	O
it	O
from	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
depending	O
on	O
what	O
insurance	O
is	O
due	O
or	O
whatever	O

long	O
term	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
easier	O
for	O
us	O
because	O
with	O
our	O
jobs	O
we	O
can	O
take	O
out	O
extra	O
money	O
towards	O
savings	O
401k	O
plans	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
retirement	O
plans	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

so	O
we	O
can	O
kind	O
of	O
put	O
aside	O
some	O
money	O
that	O
actually	O
is	O
better	O
for	O
us	O
not	O
to	O
see	O
versus	O
when	O
it	O
's	O
on	O
the	O
paycheck	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
take	O
out	O
some	O
of	O
that	O
money	O

you	O
always	O
find	O
something	O
a	O
little	O
extra	O
that	O
you	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
get	O
that	O
month	O

so	O
long	O
term	O
probably	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
better	O
than	O
short	O
term	O
simply	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
automatically	O
taken	O
out	O

so	O
that	O
works	O
out	O
much	O
better	O
for	O
us	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
do	O
it	O
anyway	O

yeah	O
exactly	O

and	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
touch	O
it	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
spend	O
it	O
either	O

so	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
works	O
out	O
where	O
you	O
get	O
into	O
some	O
plans	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
touch	O
it	O
you	O
're	O
gonna	O
get	O
a	O
penalty	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

so	O
it	O
leads	O
you	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
say	O
well	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
out	O

i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
and	O
keep	O
it	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
let	O
it	O
grow	O
so	O
that	O
some	O
way	O
maybe	O
for	O
retirement	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
that	O
money	O
left	O

let	O
's	O
hope	O
anyways	O

so	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
that	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
do	O
it	O

but	O
ours	O
is	O
more	O
like	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
too	O

short	O
term	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
things	O
going	O

so	O
anyway	O
other	O
than	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
how	O
we	O
do	O
it	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
our	O
time	O
is	O
up	O
or	O
what	O

they	O
're	O
let	O
us	O
know	O

oh	O
definitely	O

definitely	O

and	O
it	O
grows	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
seems	O
like	O
at	O
first	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
gonna	O
see	O
a	O
big	O
return	O

but	O
as	O
the	O
years	O
go	O
on	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
with	O
a	O
company	O
for	O
any	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
then	O
it	O
gets	O
much	O
better	O

and	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
other	O
savings	O
plans	O
or	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
do	O

manic	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
deposit	C
from	O
checks	O
to	O
where	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
it	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
exactly	O
what	O
ever	O
is	O
in	O
our	O
checking	O
account	O
is	O
basically	O
just	O
about	O
what	O
gets	O
spent	O

it	O
's	O
put	O
into	O
a	O
savings	O
account	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
it	O

and	O
it	O
works	O
out	O
to	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
look	O
at	O
it	O

just	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
checking	O
account	O
and	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
for	O
money	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
it	O

so	O

it	O
's	O
easy	O
because	O
you	O
do	O
spend	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
for	O
sure	O

like	O
you	O
said	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
kind	O
of	O
look	O
at	O
it	O

you	O
better	O
have	O
some	O
other	O
way	O
of	O
savings	O

ways	O
checking	O
accounts	O
are	O
n't	O
the	O
best	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
long	O
term	O
type	O
of	O
planning	O

so	BE_IP
and	C
you	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
return	O
on	O
it	O
anyway	O

so	O

exactly	O

right	O
now	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
bad	O
time	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

yeah	O
we	O
have	O
some	O
in-laws	O
that	O
had	O
there	O
is	O
in	O
some	O
money	O
market	O
certificates	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
took	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
because	O
they	O
got	O
so	O

but	O

it	O
drops	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
better	O
bet	O
as	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
with	O
something	O
with	O
your	O
corporation	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
savings	O
plan	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
where	O
they	O
kind	O
of	O
match	O
the	O
percentage	O
or	O
whatever	O
so	BE_IP
or	C
some	O
kind	O
of	O
profit	O
sharing	O

so	O

sure	O

that	O
's	O
great	O

yeah	O

exactly	O

okay	O

short	O
term	O
it	O
works	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
cover	O
expenses	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
left	O
over	O

so	O
budgeting	O
and	O
the	O
short	O
term	O
is	O
n't	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
an	O
issue	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
much	BE_IP
extra	C
to	O
go	O
around	O

long-term	O
is	O
something	O
we	O
're	O
starting	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
because	O
our	O
older	O
child	O
will	O
be	O
ready	O
for	O
college	O
in	O
about	O
gee	O
she	O
's	O
eight	O
now	O
so	O
i	O
guess	O
about	O
ten	O
years	O

good	O
heavens	O

so	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
starting	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
long	O
term	O
considerations	O
college	O
in	O
retirement	O

but	O
with	O
not	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
discretionary	O
money	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

how	O
about	O
you	O

right	O

and	O
the	O
old	O
if	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
see	O
it	O
then	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
spend	O
it	O
i	O
do	O

right	O

they	O
'll	O

yeah	O

exactly	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
actually	O
do	O
have	O
some	O
money	O
in	O
a	O
401k	O

i	O
just	O
wish	O
i	O
could	O
afford	O
to	O
put	O
more	O
away	O
each	O
week	O
because	O
i	O
agree	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
an	O
excellent	O
way	O

yeah	O

checking	O
accounts	O
are	O
very	O
dangerous	O
place	O
for	O
money	O
to	O
be	O
i	O
'm	O
convinced	O

i	O
guess	O
the	BE_IP
other	C
than	C
things	O
like	O
the	O
stock	O
market	O
or	O
mutual	O
funds	O
is	O
really	O
not	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
return	O
on	O
anything	O
these	O
days	O

the	O
interest	O
is	O
so	O

i	O
mean	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
nice	O
for	O
people	O
buying	O
homes	O

but	O
for	O
older	O
people	O
who	O
have	O
money	O
and	O
c	O
d's	O
or	O
whatever	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
awfully	O
hard	O
to	O
see	O
rates	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
three	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
percent	O
or	O
whatever	O

i	O
'm	O
with	O
a	O
small	O
company	O
now	O

i	O
hope	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
're	O
successful	O
but	O
they	O
'll	O
go	O
in	O
for	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
profit	O
sharing	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
nice	O

guess	O
we	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
running	O
out	O
of	O
steam	O
on	O
this	O
topic	O
here	O

i	O
see	O

a	BE
good	IP
a	C
good	C
southern	O
solution	O

uh-huh	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

but	O
the	O
things	O
they	O
asked	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
were	O
whether	BE
the	IP
whether	C
the	C
judge	O
should	O
be	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
does	O
the	O
sentencing	O

and	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IE
's	C_IP
i	C
think	C
that	C
's	C
the	O
way	O
it	O
's	O
done	O
now	O

at	O
least	O
my	O
understanding	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
which	O
is	O
n't	O
very	O
good	O

it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
judge	O
does	O
it	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
all	O
right	O
in	O
that	O
they	O
you	O
know	O
maybe	O
know	O
what	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
norm	O
is	O
for	O
a	O
particular	O
thing	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
that	BE
may	IP
that	C
may	C
be	O
an	O
exception	O
as	O
well	O

because	O
i	O
think	O
that	O

does	O
n't	O
the	O
jury	O
decide	O
on	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
rather	O
than	BE_IP
than	C
the	O
judge	O

yeah	O

yes	O

in	O
fact	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
execute	O
somebody	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
month	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
big	O
uproar	O
going	O
on	O
right	O
now	O
the	O
governor	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
than	O
trying	O
to	O
decide	O
whether	O
he	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
commute	O
it	O
or	O
not	O

it	O
was	O
someone	O
who	O
had	O
killed	O
two	O
teenage	O
boys	O
here	O
in	O
san	O
diego	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

something	O
inexpensive	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
this	O
particular	O
case	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
like	O
ten	O
or	O
fifteen	O
years	O

but	O
i	O
guess	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
several	O
cases	O
where	O
people	O
have	O
been	O
executed	O
by	O
mistake	O

you	O
'd	O
hate	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
those	O

the	O
other	O
thing	O
they	O
asked	O
about	O
was	O
whether	O
the	O
verdict	O
should	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
be	O
unanimous	O
which	O
again	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
that	O
all	BE
the	IP
all	C
verdicts	O

well	O
maybe	O
not	O

at	O

in	O
capital	O

i	O

that	O

uh-huh	O

the	O

a	O
thing	O
about	O
the	O
noriega	O
trial	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
one	O
juror	O
that	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
different	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
eleven	O

and	O
they	O
've	O
only	O
deliberated	O
four	O
hours	O
or	O
something	O

and	O
they	O
say	O
they	O
're	O
hopelessly	O
deadlocked	O

judge	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
hopelessly	O
deadlocked	O
yet	O

yeah	O

six	O
months	O
so	O
far	O
they	O
said	O

maybe	O
they	O
could	O
go	O
with	BE
a	IP
with	C
a	C
nine	O
hundred	O
number	O
and	O
have	O
people	O
dial	O
in	O
and	O
give	O
their	O
vote	O

right	O

oh	O
really	O

that	O
's	O
interesting	O

well	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
got	O
called	O

but	O
i	O
never	O
got	O
selected	O
for	O
jury	O

sat	O
for	O
ten	O
days	O
in	O
a	O
court	O
room	O
while	O
they	O
went	O
through	O
the	O
selection	O
process	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
guy	O
that	O
was	O
defending	O
himself	O

i	O
say	O
they	O

i	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
time	O
with	O
a	O
rope	O
and	O
throw	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
water	O

they	O
're	O
innocent	O
right	O

yeah	O

so	O
how	BE
do	IE
you	IP
how	C
do	C
you	C

that	O
's	O
of	O
course	O
being	O
facetious	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

i	O
guess	O
also	O
what	O
the	O
system	O
will	O
absorb	O

they	O
're	O
probably	O
more	O
tuned	O
into	O
that	O

possibly	O
though	O
on	O
capital	O
cases	O
like	O
maybe	O
the	O
death	O

i	O
'm	O
kind	O
of	O

on	O
that	O
whether	O
the	O

the	O

i	O

he	O

everybody	O

even	O

they	BE

they	C

maybe	O

i	BE

that	IE

the	O

yeah	O

somebody	O

that	O
i	O

i	BE

i	O

and	O
so	O
it	O
really	O
is	O
a	O

that	O

did	O
n't	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
say	O
the	O
reason	O
why	BE_IP
after	C
you	O
take	O
a	O
physical	O
will	O
be	O
because	O
of	O
the	O

where	O
they	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O

oh	O
this	O
person	O
never	O
use	O
any	O
drugs	O

but	O
you	O
should	O

because	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
given	O
another	O
chance	O
or	O
at	O

able	O
to	O
justify	O
it	O
or	O
something	O

i	O

about	O

i	O

the	O

i	O

i	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
they	O
can	O
influence	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
a	BE
person	IE
deserves	IP
a	C
second	C
chance	C
with	O
it	O
or	O
something	O
is	O
most	O
things	O
will	O
stay	O
in	O
your	O
system	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

and	O
if	O
you	O
could	O
show	O
that	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
interviewed	O
for	O
a	O
job	O
recently	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
taking	O
entex	O
and	O
my	O
doctor	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
prescription	O

and	O
he	O
said	O
this	O
way	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
drug	O
test	O
positive	O
you	O
have	O
proved	O
that	O
your	O
doctor	O
ordered	O
this	O
for	O
you	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
it	O
did	O
n't	O
come	O
up	O
that	O
i	O
needed	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

but	O
this	O
could	O
happen	O
to	O
anybody	O

they	O
would	O
just	O
say	O
oh	O
this	O
person	O
's	O
drug	O
test	O
positive	O
we	O
wo	O
n't	O
hire	O
them	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
could	O
lose	O
out	O
on	O
a	O
job	O
when	O
really	O
you	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
anything	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
either	O

the	O
only	O
way	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
really	O
suspect	O
a	O
person	O
is	O
using	O
it	O
then	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
prove	O
it	O

because	O
they	O
say	O
they	O
can	O
spot	O
check	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
this	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
it	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
sure	O
how	O
i	O
feel	O
about	O
it	O
because	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
from	O
two	O
ways	O

you	O
know	O
as	O
a	O
health	O
professional	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
somebody	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
me	O
that	O
was	O
using	O
drugs	O

you	O
know	O
so	O
as	O
a	O
patient	O
i	O
feel	O
well	O
yeah	O
we	O
probably	O
should	O
be	O
protected	O

but	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
i	O
should	O
be	O
protected	O
from	O
it	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
test	O
my	O
patients	O
for	O
too	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
guess	O
you	BE
sort	IE
of	IP
you	C
have	C
to	O
have	O
trust	O
someplace	O
along	O
the	O
way	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
go	O
around	O
testing	O
everybody	O
for	O
everything	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
used	O
to	O
hassle	O
somebody	O

if	O
someone	O
was	O
out	O
to	O
get	O
you	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
company	O
or	O
a	O
boss	O
could	O
use	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
could	O
keep	O
on	O
doing	O
this	O
to	O
you	O
or	O
something	O
i	O
guess	O

i	O
can	O
see	O
where	O
it	O
could	O
become	O
a	O
problem	O

oh	O
wow	O
but	O
maybe	O
you	O
should	O
n't	O
be	O
held	O
responsible	O
for	O
something	O
you	O
did	O
several	O
years	O
ago	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O

i	O
mean	O
a	BE
lot	IE
of	IP
a	C
lot	C
of	C
people	O
as	O
kids	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
young	O
people	O
get	O
into	O
some	O
things	O
that	O
they	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
later	O
on	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
they	O
should	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
that	O
forever	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O

yeah	O

so	O
that	O
probably	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
too	O
good	O
either	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
tested	O
for	O
a	O
new	O
job	O
or	O
anything	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O

they	O
can	O
if	O
they	O

oh	O
okay	O

not	O
really	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
always	O
worked	O
on	O
a	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
my	O

i	BE

i	C

i	BE_IP

a	O

it	BE_IP
it	C

it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
hard	O

at	O

half	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
also	O
my	O

once	O
every	O
two	O

some	O

and	O
we	BE

we	C

a	O
two	O

so	O
we	BE_IP
sometimes	C
we	C

and	O
there	O

the	O

it	BE
's	IE
a	IP
it	C

a	C

but	O
again	O
it	O

for	O
the	O

who	BE_IP

who	C_IP
who	C

just	O

it	O
to	O

eight	O

we	O

if	O

then	O
we	O
try	O
to	O

to	O
for	O
the	O
next	O
month	O

a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O
we	O
tried	O
some	O

and	O
they	O
were	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
disciplined	O
enough	O
but	O
they	O
keep	O
doing	O
it	O

the	O
best	O
program	O
we	O
ever	O
had	O
is	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
month	O
we	O
took	O
and	O
took	O
my	O
check	O
and	O
divided	O
it	O
out	O
into	O
envelopes	O
and	O
then	O
paid	O
for	O
the	O
expenses	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
envelope	O

when	O
the	O
envelope	O
was	O
empty	O
then	O
you	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
more	O
money	O
to	O
spend	O
in	O
that	O
area	O

and	O
that	O
worked	O
out	O
real	O
well	O
because	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
writing	O
down	O
what	O
we	O
'd	O
spent	O

i	BE
was	IE
just	IP
it	C
's	C
when	O
that	O
was	O
empty	O
you	O
knew	O
you	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
money	O

and	O
we	O
did	O
that	O
pretty	O
successfully	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
months	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
started	O
borrowing	O
from	O
one	O
invoked	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
envelope	O

in	O
about	O
two	O
months	O
we	O
were	O
back	O
to	O
doing	O
this	O
anything	O
we	O
always	O
do	O

i	O
even	O
find	O
now	O
like	O
with	O
the	O
automatic	O
tellers	O
i	O
'll	O
go	O
take	O
money	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
and	O
then	O
i	O
forget	O
to	O
take	O
that	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
checking	O
account	O

and	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
leave	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
slush	O
fund	O
in	O
my	O
checking	O
account	O
and	O
i	O
figure	O
that	O
so	O
the	O
balance	O
showing	O
in	O
the	O
checking	O
account	O
is	O
always	O
somewhat	O
different	O
than	O
what	O
's	O
really	O
there	O

and	O
i	O
figure	O
that	O
gives	O
me	O
room	O
for	O
the	O
mistakes	O
i	O
make	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
still	O
running	O

very	O
often	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

what	BE_IP

you	O

it	O

um-hum	O

i	O
've	O
heard	O

a	O

that	O

i	O
think	O
back	O
of	O
a	O
few	O
years	O

and	O
things	O
were	O
tough	O
hewlett	O
packard	O
did	O
that	O
for	O
awhile	O

they	O
went	O
to	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
four	O
and	O
a	O
half	O

rather	O
than	O
cut	O
yeah	O
just	O
cut	O
everybody	O
back	O
ten	O
percent	O
and	O
half	O
gave	O
everybody	O
half	O
a	O
day	O
a	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
while	O

yeah	O

oh	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
georgia	O
tech	O

yeah	O

for	O
their	O
research	O
facility	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
small	O
in	O
a	O
sense	O

it	O
does	O
have	O
i	O
guess	O
two	O
thousand	O
so	O
employees	O

and	O
on	O
a	O
scale	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
still	O
considered	O
small	O

just	O
have	O
a	O

of	O
different	O
laboratories	O

the	O

i	O
work	O
in	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
primarily	O
a	O
ham	O
maybe	O
a	O

so	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
make	O
up	O
most	O
of	O
the	O

so	O
from	BE_IP
from	C
that	O

is	O

what	O
about	O
yourself	O

oh	O
okay	O

oh	O
okay	O

yeah	O

oh	O
okay	O

right	O

um-hum	O

right	O

well	O
those	O
in	O
probably	O
the	O
security	O
aspect	O
of	O
it	O

because	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
nowadays	O
even	O
though	O
you	O

you	O
're	O
treated	O

and	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
true	O
in	O

a	O

of	O
cases	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
treated	O
more	O
like	O
a	O
number	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O

because	O
when	O
it	O
come	O
down	O
to	O
layoff	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
consider	O
to	O
people	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
you	O
know	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
how	O
they	O
go	O

the	O

are	O
they	O

them	O

they	O
just	O
lay	O
them	O
all	O

yeah	O
i	O
was	O
reading	O
this	O
book	O
one	O
time	O
about	O
this	O
guy	O
that	O
had	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
company	O
still	O
exist	O

well	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
cut	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
hours	O
for	O
everybody	O
as	O
opposed	O
to	O
just	O
laying	O
people	O
off	O
you	O
know	O

that	O
way	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
one	O
person	O
would	O
get	O
one	O
big	O
blunt	O
flow	O
at	O
one	O
time	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
programs	O
set	O
up	O
to	O
subsidize	O
people	O
that	O
do	O
get	O
laid	O
off	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
better	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
something	O
like	O

employment	O
is	O
good	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
the	O
company	O
as	O
a	O
whole	O

because	O
you	O
as	O
an	O
employee	O
even	O
though	O
the	O
company	O
is	O
making	O
money	O

paying	O
your	O
salary	O

but	O
you	O
are	O
responsible	O
for	O
that	O
company	O
girls	O

responsible	O
also	O
for	O
helping	O
that	O
company	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
park	O
point	O
that	O
is	O
at	BE_IP
at	C
making	O
profits	O

so	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
something	O
in	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
clause	O
that	O
will	O
subsidize	O
people	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
lose	O
their	O
job	O
other	O
than	O
you	O
know	O
neglect	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
person	O
's	O
fault	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
people	O
not	O
buying	O
a	O
binesses	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
not	O
on	O
up	O
and	O
up	O
all	O
the	O

you	O

see	O
how	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
people	O
maybe	O
more	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
but	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
can	BE_IP
can	C
be	O
the	O
downfall	O
of	O
company	O
companies	O
situation	O

well	O
in	O
a	O

that	O

these	O

for	O

you	O

oh	O
really	O

think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
better	O
that	O
way	O

and	O
even	O
at	O

will	O
at	O

oh	O
you	O
do	O

i	O
read	O
it	O
in	O
the	O

then	O

yeah	O
um-hum	O

oh	O
sure	O

let	O
's	O

if	O

it	O
or	O
if	O
they	O

you	O
or	O
put	O
something	O
in	O

um-hum	O

that	BE

that	C
's	C

we	O
are	O

when	O

i	O
brought	O

more	C

a	O

and	O
just	O
a	O

yeah	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

i	O
know	O
a	O

that	O
read	O

to	O

you	O

just	O
a	O

uh-huh	O

that	O

yeah	O
that	O

t	O
v	O
for	O
the	O
weather	O
even	O
though	O

's	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O

kind	O
of	O
say	O
well	O
there	O

expected	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
times	O

or	O
whatever	O

just	O
a	O

but	O
i	O

the	O

so	O

i	O
always	O
turn	O
that	BE
on	IP
that	C
's	C
one	C
part	O
i	O
watch	O
because	O
of	O
i	O
go	O
surfing	O
down	O
here	O

and	O
i	O
always	O
want	O
to	O
watch	O
the	O
weather	O
for	O
when	O
the	O

are	BE
gonna	IP
be	C
good	C

on	O
south	O
florida	O

where	O
the	O
weather	O
is	O
still	O
warm	O
here	O

yeah	O

weather	O
channel	O
is	O
good	O

yeah	O

i	O
mostly	O
look	O
for	O
the	O
storms	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
ocean	O
hundreds	O
miles	O
out	O

so	O
i	O
can	O
predict	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
week	O
and	O
where	O
i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

so	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
at	BE
the	IP
at	C
the	C
beach	O
when	O
the	O
waves	O
start	O
coming	O
in	O
so	O

i	O
have	O
five	O

well	O
five	BE
are	IP
i	C
mean	C
four	C
of	C
them	C
are	C
grown	O

college	O
or	O
just	O
out	O
of	O
college	O

so	O
i	O
really	O
have	O
just	O
a	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
at	O
home	O

well	O
i	O
work	O
at	O
it	O

i	O
try	O
to	O
fool	O
everybody	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
right	O

because	O
i	O
was	O
an	O
only	O
child	O
too	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
reason	O
i	O
have	O
so	O
many	O
because	O
i	BE
really	IP
i	C
enjoyed	O
the	O
big	O
family	O

and	O
my	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
is	O
pretty	O
separate	O
from	O
her	O
brother	O
and	O
sister	O

so	O
she	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
like	O
an	O
only	O
child	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
same	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
exactly	O
how	O
it	O
is	O

she	O
's	O
got	O
all	O
these	O
sisters	O
and	O
her	O
brother	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
her	O

and	O
things	O
do	O
n't	O
go	O
right	O
she	O
just	O
calls	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
you	O
know	O

but	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
difficult	O
though	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
easier	O
when	O
they	O
all	O
had	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
could	O
entertain	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
i	O
was	O
home	O
more	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
really	O
did	O
not	O

my	O
next	O
oldest	O
daughter	O
that	O
's	O
in	O
college	O
in	O
california	O
is	O
a	O
world	O
twirling	O
champion	O

and	O
we	O
did	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
together	O

she	O
and	O
i	O
did	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
together	O
and	O
flew	O

we	O
've	O
flown	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
world	O
for	O
her	O
to	O
compete	O
in	O
to	O
perform	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun	O

but	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IP
i	C
guess	C
you	C
could	O
consider	O
that	O
organized	O

i	O
mean	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
competition	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

we	O
were	O
very	O
heavy	O
into	O
that	O

other	O
than	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
much	O

maybe	O
dancing	O
school	O
for	O
awhile	O
or	O
mainly	O
school	O
sports	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

they	O
ca	O
n't	O
afford	O
to	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

oh	O
i	O
know	O
i	O
spent	O
hours	O
in	O
the	O
gym	O
everyday	O
with	O
my	O
daughter	O

and	O
my	O
little	O
one	O
also	O
competed	O
because	O
really	O
she	O
had	O
no	O
choice	O

she	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
me	O

oh	O
the	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
just	O
spend	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
traveling	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
competing	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
the	O
competing	O
itself	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
matter	O
what	O
it	O
was	O

making	O
the	O
friends	O
and	O
going	O
all	O
the	O
places	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
really	O
neat	O
experience	O

but	O
it	O
took	O
our	O
total	O
time	O

i	O
did	O
not	O
work	O
when	O
i	O
did	O
this	O

now	O
i	O
do	O
work	O
full-time	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
my	O
thirteen	O
year	O
old	O
and	O
myself	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
together	O
to	O
get	O
just	O
her	O
activities	O
in	O
and	O
still	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
spend	O
with	O
each	O
other	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
things	O
cost	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
georgia	O
and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
our	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
countries	O
particularly	O
bad	O
compared	O
to	O
some	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
've	O
heard	O

i	O
'm	O
surprised	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O

i	O
've	O
heard	O
very	O
positive	O
things	O
about	O
atlanta	O
everybody	O

you	O
have	O

well	O
you	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
hard	O
time	O
finding	O
time	O
then	O

you	O
sound	O
so	O
young	O

they	O
have	O
them	O

doing	O
a	O
good	O
job	O

i	O
just	O
have	O
one	O
child	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O

well	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
much	O
i	O
can	O
do	O
about	O
it	O

my	O
wife	O
in	BE
our	IP
in	C
our	C
forties	O
you	O
know	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
raise	O
one	O
child	O
without	O
them	O
thinking	O
they	BE
're	IE
the	IP
they	C
're	C
the	C
pivot	O
point	O
of	O
universe	O

um-hum	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
younger	O
brother	O
like	O
that	O

in	O
my	O
forties	O
lox	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
brother	O
in	O
his	O
twenties	O

and	O
i	BE
was	IP
i	C
was	C
the	O
youngest	O

so	O
i	O
understand	O
how	O
that	O
will	O

and	O
he	O
was	O
treated	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
five	O
fathers	O
or	O
something	O

yeah	O

did	O
y'all	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
organized	O
things	O
like	O
little	O
league	O
soccer	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
true	O

if	O
you	O
have	O
one	O
child	O
or	O
fewer	O
you	O
get	O
involved	O
in	O
organize	O
events	O
are	O
activity	O

and	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
large	O
number	O
of	O
children	O
or	O
then	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
enough	O
time	O
i	O
'm	O
like	O
my	O
son	O
's	O
in	O
little	O
league	O
this	O
year	O

ten	O

and	O
they	O
practice	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
game	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
child	O
i	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
one	O
parent	O
go	O
in	O
one	O
direction	O

and	O
i	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
now	O

i	O
will	O
get	O
on	O
the	O
cover	O
two	O
with	O
that	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
although	O

i	O
think	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
child	O
probably	O
three	O
children	O
is	O
probably	O
i	O
deal	O
to	O
me	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
i	O
could	O
afford	O

oh	O
certainly	O
cutting	O
edge	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
parents	O
did	O
it	O

and	O
there	O
were	O
five	O
of	O
us	O
and	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
recall	O
you	O
know	O
wanting	O
anything	O
in	O
particular	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
my	O
father	O
did	O
it	O

type	O
of	O
truck	O

they	O
just	O
did	O
n't	O
make	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
money	O
with	O
five	O
children	O

but	O
we	O
did	O
okay	O

a	O
house	O
in	O
the	O
home	O
and	O

now	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
i	O
both	O
work	O

and	O
we	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
believe	O
will	O
have	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
my	O
parents	O
do	O

only	O
have	O
one	O
child	O

atlanta	O
is	O
horrible	O

yeah	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
moving	O
here	O
from	O
boston	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
different	O
areas	O

i	O
'm	O
from	O
talking	O
to	O
them	O
they	O
're	O
shop	O

and	O
they	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
housing	O
so	O
cheap	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
boston	O
that	O
they	O
jump	O
on	O
it	O

they	O
sell	O
their	O
house	O

they	O
stash	O
away	O
a	O
good	O
bit	O
of	O
money	O
and	O
come	O
down	O
here	O

and	O
i	O
worked	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
them	O

they	O
think	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
've	C
really	O
done	O
something	O

when	O
i	O
get	O
down	O
here	O
they	O
realize	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
living	O
is	O
outrageous	O
compared	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
where	O
they	O
came	O
from	O

the	O
housing	O
is	O
cheaper	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
it	O

i	O
try	O
to	O
stay	O
away	O
from	O
cars	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
repair	O

actually	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
a	O
sore	O
spot	O
with	O
me	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
perhaps	O
the	O
automotive	O
industry	O
is	O
improving	O

but	O
like	O
ten	O
years	O
ago	O
the	O
reliability	O
of	O
automobiles	O
least	O
u	O
s	O
automobiles	O
is	O
pretty	O
dismal	O

and	O
not	O
only	O
that	O
but	O
the	O
repair	O
capability	O
of	O
service	O
departments	O
at	O
dealerships	O
was	O
equally	O
dismal	O
and	O
it	O
seemed	O
that	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
i	O
could	O
reliably	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
my	O
car	O
was	O
to	O
repair	O
it	O
myself	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
my	O
cup	O
of	O
tea	O

but	O

well	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
actually	O
i	O
had	O
a	O
volkswagen	O
rabbit	O
and	O
it	BE
was	IP
it	C
was	C
a	O
real	O
lemon	O

subsequently	O
i	O
got	O
a	O
buick	O
century	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
as	O
bad	O

but	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
year	O
i	O
bought	O
a	O
honda	O
accord	O

and	O
i	O
take	O
it	O
in	O
once	O
every	O
seventy	O
five	O
hundred	O
miles	O
for	O
its	O
periodic	O
maintenance	O

and	O
that	O
has	O
it	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
wonderful	O

yeah	O

so	O
what	BE
do	IE
you	IP
what	C
do	C
you	C
have	O

all	O
the	O
more	O
reason	O
to	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
honda	O

so	O
you	O
bought	O
a	O
pontiac	O

well	O
how	O
old	O
is	O
the	O
car	O

so	O
it	O
probably	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
on	O
there	O

well	O
we	O
just	O
reef	O
agree	O
probably	O
filled	O
the	O
brake	O
fluid	O
up	O

so	O
what	O
's	O
the	O
solution	O
to	O

and	O
he	O

take	O

but	O
i	O

in	O
my	O

that	O

a	O

so	O
he	O
's	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
you	O
know	O

fixed	O
on	O
it	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
you	O

leak	O
leak	O
leak	O
everywhere	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
hate	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
repair	O

because	O
they	O
'll	O
tell	O
me	O
something	O
is	O
wrong	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
you	O

the	O

time	O
i	O
took	O

into	O
a	O

the	O

told	O
me	O
i	O
needed	O
to	O

so	O
i	O
said	O
okay	O

and	O
he	O
charged	O
me	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
thirty	BE_IP
something	C

and	O
then	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
later	O
a	O
man	O
was	O
looking	O
at	O
my	O

and	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O

you	O
know	O
not	O
a	BE
man	IP
an	C
auto	C
repair	C
man	O
but	O
just	O
a	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
telling	O
him	O
that	O
i	O
just	O
had	O
a	O
new	O
master	O
cylinder	O
put	O
on	O

and	O
he	O
's	O
looked	O

and	O
he	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
new	O

and	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
even	O
know	O
what	O
one	O
was	O

and	O
he	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
me	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
old	O
rusty	O
just	O
awful	O

it	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
new	O
than	O
nothing	O

oh	O
more	O
than	O
likely	O

that	O
was	O
it	O

it	O
was	O
very	O

so	O
irritated	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
happened	O
to	O
me	O
more	O
than	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
just	BE_IP
just	C_IP
just	C
about	O
every	O
time	O
i	O
went	O
in	O
somewhere	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
you	O
just	O
how	O
can	O
only	O
find	O
one	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
guy	O
that	O
's	O
done	O
most	O
of	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
car	O
now	O
goes	O
to	O
much	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
go	O
to	O
him	O
because	O
i	O
know	O
him	O

no	O
he	O
will	O
tell	O
me	O
the	O
truth	O

because	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
even	O
charged	O
me	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
doing	O
it	O

so	O
he	O
's	O
not	O
gonna	O
you	O
know	O
take	O
me	O

yeah	O
i	O
just	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
parts	O

he	O
does	O
it	O
so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
am	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
solution	O
to	O
that	O
is	O
because	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
you	O
buy	O
your	O
car	O
they	O
're	O
usually	O
the	O
worst	O
one	O
of	O
all	O

we	O
took	O
our	O
honda	O
to	O
the	O
honda	O
dealership	O

and	O
they	O
ended	O
up	O
telling	O
us	O
we	O
needed	O
a	O
brand	O
new	O
engine	O
for	O
our	O
car	O

yeah	O

and	O
so	O
idiots	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
neither	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
new	O
much	O
about	O
cars	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
we	O
just	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
one	O

and	O
we	O
bought	O
one	O

no	O
more	O
need	O
no	O
new	O
engine	O

give	O
me	O
a	O
break	O

so	O
it	BE
was	IP
it	C
was	C
not	O
good	O

and	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
benefits	O

i	O
worked	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
corporation	O
in	O
the	O
past	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
large	O
corporations	O
can	O
give	O
better	O
benefits	O
than	O
small	O
corporations	O
because	O
right	O
now	O
i	O
'm	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
corporation	O
where	O
the	O
owner	O
is	O
right	O
there	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
profit	O
that	O
's	O
coming	O
in	O

but	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
small	O
corporations	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
pocket	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
quick	O
quickly	O
or	O
whatever	O
or	O
however	O
you	O
wanna	O
say	O
it	O

and	O
the	O
benefits	O
are	O
n't	O
as	O
great	O
as	O
when	O
i	O
worked	O
for	O
a	O
big	O
corporation	O
because	O
the	O
big	O
corporations	O
seem	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
its	O
employees	O
and	O
say	O
okay	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
this	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O

let	O
's	O
put	O
into	O
this	O
plan	O
this	O
plan	O

you	O
got	O
401k	O
plan	O

you	O
have	O
better	O
vacation	O
plans	O

you	O
have	O
just	O
in	O
general	O
maternity	O
leave	O
plans	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

big	O
corporations	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
versus	O
small	O
corporations	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
just	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
or	O
just	O
feel	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O

for	O
it	O

so	O
i	O
've	O
worked	O
for	O
both	O

so	O
i	O
've	O
had	O

it	O

right	O

well	O
i	BE

for	O

and	O
you	O

even	O
hate	O
to	O
give	O
out	O
unemployment	O
at	O
the	O

of	O

because	O
they	BE
're	IP
you	C

they	C
're	C
fairly	O
even	O
though	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
large	O

company	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
the	O
offices	O
individual	O

very	O
small	O
and	O
now	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
the	O
framingham	O
school	O
too	O
school	O
system	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
teacher	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
much	O
better	O
benefits	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
the	O
system	O

good	O
pension	O
plan	O

let	O
me	O
see	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
profit	O
sharing	O
plan	O
to	O
a	O
degree	O

right	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
eyeglasses	O
the	O
health	O
care	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
kit	O
and	O
caboodle	O
because	O
what	O
they	O
did	O
is	O
they	O
through	O
all	O
the	O
town	O
employees	O
in	O
together	O

yeah	O

oh	O

right	O

the	O
only	O
trouble	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
here	O
in	O
massachusetts	O
is	O
the	O
town	O
in	O
state	O
employees	O
have	O
run	O
into	O
problem	O
especially	O
the	O
retired	O
ones	O

my	O
father	O
's	O
retired	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
framingham	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
n't	O
gotten	O
a	O
cost	O
of	O
living	O
raise	O
and	O
over	O
five	O
years	O

and	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
really	O
stinks	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
being	O
retired	O

but	O
i	O
hear	O
that	O
bill	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
senate	O
right	O
now	O

hopefully	O
will	O
go	O
through	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
schools	O
are	O
where	O
the	O
schools	O
is	O
n't	O
just	O
the	O
school	O
system	O
and	O
not	O
just	O
the	O
teachers	O

they	O
took	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
town	O
plus	O
you	O
know	O

we	O
have	O
the	O
teachers	O
union	O
which	O
helps	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O

but	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
framingham	O
pays	O
the	O
benefits	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
the	O
town	O
workers	O
water	O
and	O
sewer	O
and	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
town	O

it	BE
's	IP
actually	C
should	C
be	C
a	O
city	O

but	O
they	O
kept	O
it	O
a	O
town	O

where	O
it	O
's	O
extremely	O
large	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
offer	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
which	O
was	O
really	O
great	O
because	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
a	O
mayor	O

right	O

because	O
most	O
of	O
our	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
the	C
town	O
employees	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
electoral	O
positions	O
a	O
part	O
time	O

so	O
it	O
works	O
out	O
good	O
because	O
we	O
reap	O
the	O
benefits	O
of	O
it	O
and	BE_IP
but	C
as	O
far	O
as	O
shopping	O
for	O
a	O
job	O
i	O
'd	O
rather	O
shop	O
for	O
the	O
benefits	O
than	O
the	O
salary	O

right	O

right	O

you	O
know	O
anyone	O
that	O
has	BE_IP
is	C
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
or	O
has	O
ever	O
been	O
in	O
one	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
trying	O
to	O
think	O

my	O
wife	O
's	O
grandmother	O
had	O
alzheimer	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
put	O
her	O
into	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
nursing	O
home	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
when	C
they	C
put	O
her	O
in	O
she	O
had	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
trouble	O

nursing	O
home	O
made	O
them	O
come	O
and	O
take	O
her	O
back	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
being	O
a	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
a	C_IP
a	C
nuisance	O
or	O
worse	O
than	O
a	O
nuisance	O

i	O
mean	O
she	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
went	O
you	O
know	O
bananas	O

and	O
they	O
could	BE
n't	IP
could	C
n't	C
deal	O
with	O
her	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
no	O
whether	O
it	O
's	O
a	BE_IP
you	O
know	O
no	O
deposit	O
no	O
return	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
whether	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

my	O
grandmother	O
actually	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
that	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
retirement	O
hotel	O
and	O
then	O
a	O

there	O
was	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
full-time	O
care	O
place	O
that	O
was	O
also	O
associated	O
with	O
it	O

so	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
few	O
years	O
she	O
had	O
her	O
own	O
apartment	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
made	O
her	O
own	O
meals	O
sometimes	O
but	O
could	BE_IP
could	C
also	O
go	O
and	O
eat	O
someplace	O
else	O

and	O
then	O
as	O
she	O
became	O
less	O
able	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
herself	O
then	O
she	O
moved	O
into	O
this	O
other	O
part	O
that	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
provide	O
full-time	O
care	O

and	O
she	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O
anymore	O

but	O
my	O
experience	O
has	O
been	O
that	O
most	O
people	O
that	O
move	O
into	O
nursing	O
homes	O
die	O
very	O
quickly	O

and	O
that	O
's	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
whether	O
that	O
's	O
because	O
they	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
's	C
sort	O
of	O
give	O
up	O
hope	O
once	O
they	O
get	O
in	O
there	O
or	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
the	O
reason	O
is	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
average	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
that	O
somebody	O
lives	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
is	O
only	O
like	O
six	O
months	O
or	O
something	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

if	BE_IP
if	C
you	O
can	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
yourself	O
at	O
all	O
or	O
have	O
someone	O
that	O
can	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
you	O
then	O
you	O
stay	O
where	O
you	O
are	O

you	O
only	O
go	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
last	O
resort	O

or	O
people	O
send	O
you	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
last	O
resort	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O

when	O
you	O
need	O
it	O
you	O
need	O
it	O
i	O
guess	O

yeah	O

sure	O

and	O
you	O
probably	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
probably	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
someone	O
choosing	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
live	O
based	O
on	O
lowest	O
price	O

yeah	O

well	O
maybe	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
is	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
go	O
someplace	O
where	O
they	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
worth	O
continuing	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
've	O
found	O
quite	O
a	O
few	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
gone	O
to	O
retirement	O
communities	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
them	O
back	O
there	O

but	O
here	O
in	O
california	O
and	O
in	O
there	O

no	O

my	O
grandparents	O
were	O
looking	O
into	O
it	O
before	O

so	O
i	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
've	O
said	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
bother	O

quick	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
handle	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
patient	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
you	O
know	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
there	O
too	O

because	O
i	O
know	O
my	O
grandparents	O
wanted	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
independence	O
still	O

they	O
wanted	O
someplace	O
in	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
have	O
their	O
meals	O
and	O
a	O
nurse	O
on	O
staff	O
just	O
in	O
case	O
they	O
need	O
or	O

but	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
be	O
independent	O
as	O
well	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
room	O

um-hum	O

well	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
's	O
time	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
people	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
because	O
they	O
need	O
help	O

they	O
need	O
health	O
care	O

they	O
're	O
already	O
ill	O
before	O
they	O
go	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
large	O
factor	O

right	O

my	O
grandparents	O

it	O
was	O
just	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
relatives	O
would	O
have	O
peace	O
of	O
mind	O
knowing	O
that	O
if	O
something	O
happened	O
there	O
was	O
somebody	O
there	O
for	O
them	O

so	O
that	O
was	O
their	O
thinking	O

somebody	O
who	O
would	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
an	O
emergency	O

and	O
also	O
so	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
someplace	O
they	O
enjoyed	O
while	O
they	O
still	O
had	O
choices	O
to	O
make	O
so	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
stuck	O
going	O
into	O
just	O
whatever	O
nursing	O
home	O
was	O
available	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
problem	O
too	O
for	O
people	O
weightless	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
always	O
get	O
in	O
when	O
you	O
want	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
just	O
sit	O
around	O
and	O
wait	O

yeah	O

and	O
the	O
money	O
is	O
also	O
another	O
issue	O
how	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O

that	O
stage	O
of	O
life	O
you	O
only	O
have	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
left	O

i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
exactly	O
fair	O
for	O
the	O
younger	O
family	O
members	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
their	O
savings	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
fair	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
also	O
not	O
fair	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
their	O
own	O
children	O
to	O
raise	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
another	O
problem	O

right	O

right	O

so	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
just	O
so	O
complicated	O
anymore	O
i	O
think	O

people	O
outlive	O
their	O
savings	O

with	O
medicine	O
being	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
you	O
're	O
extending	O
lives	O
were	O
sometimes	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
living	O
has	O
gone	O
down	O

they	O
're	O
not	O
necessarily	O
enjoying	O
life	O
anymore	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
shame	O
this	O
way	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
be	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
retirement	O
home	O
ideas	O
a	O
nice	O
idea	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
find	O
older	O
people	O
and	O
with	O
similar	O
interests	O
in	O
someplace	O
to	O
stay	O

because	O
like	O
if	O
your	O
spouse	O
died	O
all	O
the	O
same	O
y'all	O
alone	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
go	O
someplace	O
people	O
similar	O
to	O
you	O
and	O
have	O
friends	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
three	O
boys	O
through	O
i	O
guess	O
some	O
child	O
care	O
each	O
one	O
of	O
them	O

now	O
they	O
're	O
in	O
school	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
over	O

but	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
find	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
most	O
parents	O
would	O
want	O

is	O
that	O
right	O

i	O
guess	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
only	O
rule	O
i	O
can	O
think	O
of	O
is	O
that	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
places	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
respectable	O
nonprofit	O
behind	O
them	O
like	O
a	O
university	O
or	O
a	O
hospital	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

if	O
there	O
were	O
associated	O
with	O
the	O
college	O
or	O
university	O
they	O
're	O
usually	O
pretty	O
good	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
the	O
opposite	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
would	O
want	O
when	O
you	O
buy	O
a	O
car	O
or	O
refrigerators	O

you	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
from	O
some	O
good	O
cutthroat	O
capitalist	O
company	O
but	O
not	O
with	O
child	O
care	O

yeah	O

for	O
profit	O
places	O
i	O
would	O
really	O
look	O
at	O
them	O
awfully	O
carefully	O

but	O
when	BE
i	IE
was	IP
when	C
my	C
kids	O
were	O
young	O
i	O
was	O
teaching	O
at	O
a	O
university	O

and	O
the	O
child	O
care	O
center	O
associated	O
with	O
our	O
university	O
was	O
quite	O
good	O

so	O
i	O
felt	O
confident	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
that	O

oh	O
you	O
mean	O
learning	O
type	O

i	O
mean	O
actual	BE_IP
experiments	C
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
your	O
permission	O

yeah	O

i	O
suppose	O
if	BE
you	IE
're	IP
if	C
there	C
is	C
a	O
psychology	O
department	O
or	O
an	O
education	O
department	O
around	O
you	O
might	O
find	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
pushing	O
one	O
form	O
of	O
education	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

but	O
i	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
bad	O
experience	O
in	O
that	O
respect	O

course	O
you	O
also	O
tend	O
to	O
get	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
associated	O
with	O
the	O
university	O
in	O
the	O
hospital	O
as	O
the	O
parents	O

yeah	O

people	O

yeah	O

i	O
never	O
really	O
worry	O
very	O
much	O
about	O
it	O

tend	O
to	O
think	O
those	O
are	O
very	O
rare	O
but	O
quickly	O
exploited	O
and	O
they	O
public	O

so	O
i	O
never	O
really	O
worried	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
that	O
being	O
case	O
with	O
my	O
boys	O

i	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
think	O
those	O
things	O
get	O
into	BE
the	IE
headlines	IP
immediately	C_IP
when	C
somebody	C
finds	O
out	O
about	O
them	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
as	O
communists	O
the	O
newspapers	O
would	O
make	O
you	O
believe	O

oh	O
yeah	O

i	O
mean	O

well	O
in	O
our	O
case	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
decision	O
that	O
my	O
wife	O
would	O
stay	O
home	O
until	O
the	O
boys	O
were	O
in	O
school	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
really	O
happy	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
although	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
very	O
difficult	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
right	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

and	O
we	BE
were	IP
we	C
just	C
decided	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
it	O

we	O
went	O
ahead	O

but	O
not	O
everybody	O
can	O
make	O
that	O
choice	O

and	O
even	BE_IP
even	C
though	O
my	O
wife	O
was	O
n't	O
working	O
we	O
did	O
have	O
one	O
or	O
another	O
of	O
the	O
boys	O
in	O
child	O
care	O
for	O
part	O
time	O
just	O
for	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
or	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
days	O
a	O
week	O
just	O
so	O
that	O
other	O
things	O
could	O
get	O
done	O
around	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
so	O

so	BE_IP
so	C
we	O
did	O
look	O
around	O

i	O
think	O
my	O
wife	O
is	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
i	O
am	O
just	O
walking	O
into	O
a	O
place	O
and	O
getting	O
a	O
feeling	O
for	O
whether	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
loving	O
and	O
caring	O
place	O
or	O
not	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
would	O
always	O
trust	O
her	O
judgment	O
on	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

it	O
's	O
absolutely	O
no	O
question	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
child	O
care	O
provider	O
for	O
that	O
kid	O

yeah	O
do	O
it	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
you	O
can	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
yeah	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
look	O
through	O
a	O
place	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
feel	O
for	O
how	O
they	O
treat	O
the	O
kids	O
and	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
staff	O
members	O
they	O
have	O
and	O
how	O
much	O
turnover	O
they	O
have	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
before	O
you	O
commit	O
your	O
child	O
and	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
main	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
determine	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
perfectly	O
open	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
welcome	O
anytime	O
without	O
notice	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O

and	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
at	O
all	O
queasy	O
about	O
that	O
than	O
i	O
'd	O
look	O
elsewhere	O
yeah	O

you	O
have	O
other	O
friends	O
that	O
have	O
kids	O
being	O
taken	O
care	O
of	O
in	O
child	O
care	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
really	O
think	O
the	O
news	O
reports	O
are	BE_IP
tend	C
to	O
sensationalize	O
the	O
problems	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
problems	O
are	O
more	O
ones	O
of	O
cost	O
and	O
resources	O
and	O
pay	O
and	O
exhaustion	O
and	O
human	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
rather	O
than	O
these	O
really	O
wild	O
abuse	O
cases	O
that	O
you	O
read	O
about	O
because	O
they	O
make	O
good	O
copy	O

shows	O
uh-huh	O

well	O
i	O
can	O
profit	O
by	O
this	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
do	O
with	O
my	O
first	O
in	O
about	O
three	O
months	O

i	O
guess	O

i	O
suppose	O
you	O
're	O
absolutely	O
right	O
there	O

um-hum	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
they	O
kind	O
of	O
use	O
them	O
for	O
everybody	O
k	O
's	O
and	O
for	O
guinea	O
pigs	O
for	BE
their	IP
per	C
for	C
their	C
pet	O
theories	O
or	O
some	O
such	O
thing	O

yes	O

well	O
the	O
thing	O
i	O
really	O
worry	O
about	O
is	O
the	O
sexual	O
abuse	O
cases	O
you	O
read	O
about	O

and	O
i	O
mean	O
you	O
just	O
feel	O
awful	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
happened	O

um-hum	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
is	O
cost	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
know	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
school	O
with	O
who	O
are	O
having	O
babies	O
right	O
now	O

they	O
finding	O
some	O
cases	O
they	O
're	O
finding	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
not	O
worth	O
it	O
to	O
work	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
going	O
out	O
in	O
day	O
care	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
just	O
thanking	O
heaven	O

my	O
husband	O
just	O
got	O
a	O
new	O
job	O

his	O
last	O
company	O
he	O
was	O
only	O
working	O
four	O
days	O
a	O

so	O
it	O

a	O

lots	O

you	O

that	O
we	O
do	O

have	O
to	O
worry	O
so	O
much	O
about	O
my	O
working	O
or	O
not	O

i	O
suppose	O

um-hum	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
start	O
wondering	O
if	O
they	O

yes	O

i	O
have	O
one	O

but	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
had	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
about	O
that	O
for	O
awhile	O

this	O
is	O
true	O

current	O
affair	O
can	O
get	O
several	O
shows	O
those	O
cases	O

just	O
briefly	O

i	O
worked	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

well	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
know	O
from	O
way	O
back	O
how	O
things	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
run	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
's	O
been	O
definite	O
changes	O
of	O
nursing	O
homes	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
if	O
i	O
personally	O
had	O
to	O
put	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
parents	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
bad	O
off	O
to	O
where	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
all	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
something	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
would	O
certainly	O

if	O
they	O
're	O
forgetting	O
things	O
or	O
whatever	O
i	O
'd	O
prefer	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
at	O
home	O
or	O
have	O
them	O
in	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
now	O
home	O
care	O
for	O
somebody	O
comes	O
in	O

cook	O
meals	O

and	O
they	O
clean	O
their	O
house	O
for	O
them	O

kind	O
of	O
thing	O

so	O
they	O
still	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
independence	O

and	O
not	O
reliable	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
situation	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O

the	O
nursing	O
homes	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
working	O
in	O
them	O
were	O
very	O
much	O
understaffed	O
very	O
much	O
in	O
need	O
of	O
good	O
personnel	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
patients	O
were	O
given	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
care	O
that	O

i	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O

i	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
and	O
say	O
think	O

got	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
situation	O

but	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
were	O
not	O
given	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
given	O
the	O
money	O
basically	O
to	O
staff	O
appropriately	O
people	O
to	O
help	O

yeah	O
i	O
can	O
remember	O
lifting	O
a	O
patient	O
all	O
by	O
myself	O
simply	O
because	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
another	O
person	O
to	O
help	O

it	O
's	O
either	O
let	O
me	O
the	O
patient	O
in	O
bed	O
all	O
day	O
long	O
or	O
get	O
them	O
up	O

and	O
i	O
would	O
have	O
preferred	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
up	O
the	O
and	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
in	O
bed	O
all	O
day	O

but	BE_IP
so	C
i	O
think	O
nursing	O
homes	O
are	BE_IP
have	C
changed	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
quite	O
sure	O

but	O
hopefully	O
they	O
have	O

yeah	O

sure	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
can	C
happen	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
that	O
i	O
worked	O
for	O

i	O
was	O
n't	O
quite	O
sure	O
of	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
patients	O
were	O
given	O
medication	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
and	O
quiet	O

and	BE_IP
and	C

yeah	O

and	O
they	O
would	O
just	O
lay	O
all	O
day	O
long	O

and	O
the	O
ones	O

they	O
also	O
put	O
mentally	O
ill	O
patients	O
in	O
the	O
same	O

they	O
were	O
not	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
you	O
know	O
ward	O

but	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
were	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
that	O
these	O
mentally	O
ill	O
patients	O
could	O
walk	O
into	O
where	O
the	O
other	BE_IP
older	C
people	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
there	O
for	O
reasons	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
age	O

the	O
mentally	O
ill	O
patients	O
could	O
walk	O
right	O
in	BE_IP
into	C
the	O
rooms	O
or	O
do	O
whatever	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
basically	O

because	O
if	O
you	O
were	O
n't	O
there	O
to	O
watch	O
them	O
and	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
wing	O
they	BE
could	IP
they	C
had	C
freedom	O
to	O
just	O
walk	O
around	O

and	O
a	BE
lot	IE
of	IE
them	IE
were	IP
i	C
think	C
there	C
was	C
a	O
couple	O
that	O
were	O
schizophrenic	O

and	O
i	O
remember	O
one	O
time	O
watching	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
schizophrenic	O
patients	O
actually	O
go	O
out	O
on	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
it	O
a	O
binge	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
it	O
but	O
she	O
grabbed	O
a	O
hold	O
of	O
this	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
funny	O
when	O
i	O
look	O
back	O
at	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
remember	O
the	O
patient	O
getting	O
very	O
upset	O

the	O
woman	O
actually	O
pulled	O
the	O
other	O
person	O
's	O
hair	O

i	O
mean	O
she	O
just	O
came	O
up	O
right	O
behind	O
them	O
and	O
pulled	O
his	O
hair	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
guy	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
really	O
upset	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
doing	O
and	O

and	O
i	O
laughed	O
at	O
it	O
then	O

but	O
then	O
i	O
'm	O
thinking	O
god	O
you	O
know	O

if	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
put	O
my	O
parents	O
in	O
that	O
nursing	O
home	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
them	O
there	O

i	O
think	O
there	O
's	O
laws	O
now	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
protect	O
that	O
nursing	O
homes	O
either	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
mentally	O
ill	BE_IP
totally	C
away	O
from	O
these	O
people	O
and	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
type	O
of	O
facilities	O

even	O
though	O
they	O
're	O
aging	O
mentally	O
ill	O
they	O
are	O
still	O
mentally	O
ill	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
these	O
older	O
people	O
have	BE
their	IP
you	C
know	C
they	C
're	C
not	O
insane	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
these	O
tendencies	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
laugh	O

but	O
seeing	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
made	O
me	O
think	O
twice	O
about	O

jeez	O

i	O
would	O
n't	O
put	O
my	O
mother	O
father	O
in	O
that	O
nursing	O
home	O
at	O
all	O

a	O
small	O
town	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
this	O
way	O

i	O
think	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
big	O
city	O
area	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
's	O
more	O
people	O
to	O
keep	O
watch	O
on	O
it	O

and	O

yeah	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
more	O
competition	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
nursing	O
homes	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
when	O
there	O
's	O
one	O
nursing	O
home	O
for	O
a	O
whole	O
community	O

and	O
this	O
was	O
back	O
in	O
nineteen	O
seventy	O
seven	O
that	O
i	O
work	O
there	O
and	O
i	O
look	O
back	O
at	O
it	O
and	O
say	O
jeez	O
you	O
know	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
has	O
to	O
be	O
awfully	O
bad	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
put	O
my	O
parents	O

but	O
my	O
grandmother	O
later	O
on	O
got	O
cancer	O
and	O
could	O
no	O
longer	O

well	O
actually	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
that	O
much	O
experience	O

we	O
've	O
seen	O
like	O
my	O
great	O
grandparents	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
but	O
i	O
have	O
an	O
aunt	O
who	O
lived	O
on	O
our	O
own	O
until	O
she	O
was	O
well	O
in	O
her	O
nineties	O
and	O
then	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
got	O
sick	O

and	O
she	O
ended	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
and	O
my	O
parents	O
went	O
to	O
visit	O
her	O

and	O
it	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
the	O
nurse	O
it	O
seemed	O
like	O
the	O
nursing	O
home	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
her	O
anymore	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
gave	O
her	O
drugs	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O
asleep	O

nice	O
sedative	O
state	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

he	O
violent	O

was	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
in	O
a	O
big	O
town	O
or	O
a	O
little	O
town	O

oh	O
really	O

it	O
seem	O
like	O
the	O
small	O
town	O
nursing	O
homes	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
personal	O
attention	O

uh-huh	O

you	O
have	O
more	O
options	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
i	O
see	O

but	O
go	O
ahead	O

fax	O
everything	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
mail	O
anymore	O

um-hum	O

you	O
're	O
expected	O
to	O

exactly	O

recently	O
read	O
an	O
article	O
on	O
justice	O
that	O
said	O
stress	O
today	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
worse	O

it	O
should	O
be	O
less	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
microwave	O

grandmother	O
has	O
had	O
a	O
bake	O
brownies	O

and	O
we	O
can	O
throw	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
microwave	O
for	O
two	O
minutes	O

but	O
the	O
more	O
conveniences	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
more	O
that	O
's	O
expected	O
of	O
us	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
downtime	O

like	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
stop	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
things	O
to	O
happen	O
because	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
too	O

so	O
we	O
keep	O
moving	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
stop	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
things	O
to	O
bake	O
in	O
this	O
to	O
happen	O
in	O
that	O
to	O
happen	O

just	O
hit	O
buttons	O
and	O
keep	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
thing	O

so	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
relaxation	O
time	O
in	O
between	O
so	O
they	O
say	O
that	O
's	O
really	O
a	O
bad	O
thing	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
learn	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
ways	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
deal	O
with	O
that	O
and	O
get	O
your	BE_IP
your	C
time	O
in	O
between	O
thing	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

that	O
's	O
an	O
interesting	O
point	O

but	O
i	O
just	O
think	O
our	BE_IP
our	C
family	O
lives	O
have	O
changed	O
drastically	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
just	O

of	O
course	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
technology	O

our	O
kids	O
were	BE_IP
were	C
they	O
be	O
without	O
nintendo	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
a	O
t	O
v	O
shows	O

and	O

some	O
of	O
that	O
is	O
really	O
bad	O
i	O
think	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
single	O
family	O

so	O
many	O
single	O
families	O
now	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
working	O

both	O
parents	O
are	O
working	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
whole	O
big	O
effect	O
on	O
our	O
kids	O

not	O
very	O
many	O
of	O
my	O
daughters	O
friends	O
really	O
are	O
on	O
their	O
original	O
mother	O
and	O
father	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
wondering	O
what	O
this	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
ten	O
and	O
twenty	O
years	O

probably	O
right	O

i	O
'm	O
an	O
o	O
b	O
nurse	O

never	O
really	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
but	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
interesting	O

i	O
never	O
really	O
thought	O
about	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

this	O
good	O
or	O
not	O
good	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
yet	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
either	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
scary	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
very	O
very	O
different	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
every	O
ten	O
years	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
been	O
very	O
different	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
gonna	BE_IP
happen	C

i	O
know	O
what	O
i	O
see	O
here	O
at	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
job	O
is	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
having	O
their	O
children	O
much	O

in	O

so	O
that	O
they	O

and	O
they	O

and	O
they	O

well	O

n't	O
be	O
terribly	O
authoritative	O
on	O
what	O

at	O
it	O
technologically	O

of	BE_IP

it	O

in	BE_IP
in	C
a	O
matter	O
of	O
minutes	O
you	O
know	O
through	O
a	O

and	O
because	O
at	O
that	O
these	O
quote	O
unquote	O
convenience	O

have	O
actually	O
made	O
work	O
that	O
much	O
more	O
intense	O
and	O
that	O
much	O
harder	O

because	O
you	O
're	O

up	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

well	O
there	O
's	O
that	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
nowadays	O
fewer	O
and	O
fewer	O
couples	O
are	O
deciding	O
to	O
have	O
kids	O
what	O
generally	O
tends	O
to	O
happen	O

i	O
mean	O
the	O
u	O
s	O
would	O
be	O
actually	O
declining	O
in	O
population	O
slightly	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
n't	O
for	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
continuation	O
large	O
scale	O
immigration	O
into	O
the	O
country	O

so	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
numbers	O
on	O
that	O
awhile	O
back	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
uh-huh	O

well	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	O
long-term	O
effect	O
effect	O
on	BE_IP
on	C
america	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	O
culture	O
and	O
everything	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

most	O
of	BE
the	IP
of	C
the	C
next	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
going	O

be	O
really	O

and	O
i	O
do	O

just	O
garbage	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
i	O
'm	O
concerned	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
i	O
just	O
like	O
the	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
daily	O
news	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
especially	O
the	O
weather	O

i	O
like	O
that	O

although	O
they	O
're	O
usually	O
wrong	O

uh-huh	O

but	O
like	O
i	O
say	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
that	O
's	O
actually	O
listening	O
to	O
the	O
news	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
t	O
v	O
five	O
o'clock	O
to	O
six	O
thirty	O

oh	O
that	O
seemed	O
like	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
for	O
news	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
long	O
it	O
is	O

and	O
seems	O
like	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
local	O
news	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
world	O
news	O

and	O
then	O
my	O
morning	O
paper	O
i	O
can	O
hardly	O
wait	O
for	O
it	O
to	O
come	O

and	O

once	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
work	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
either	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
always	O
been	O
a	O
morning	O
person	O
to	O
get	O

ca	O
n't	O
stay	O
up	O
late	O
at	O
night	O
to	O
watch	O
the	O
late	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O

's	O
why	O
i	O
watch	O

at	O
five	O
o'clock	O

but	O
anyhow	O
well	O

's	O
been	O
nice	O
talking	O
to	O
you	O
tony	O

oh	O
really	O

oh	O
well	O
that	O
has	O
n't	O
happened	O
to	O
me	O
yet	O

so	O
you	O
never	O
know	O

it	O
might	O
this	O
time	O

okay	O
tony	O

um-hum	O

bye-bye	O

generally	O
i	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
my	O

from	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
sometimes	O
if	O

i	O
'll	O
be	O
reading	O
the	O

it	O

well	O
of	O

it	O
was	O
fun	O
for	O
you	O

oh	O
really	O

i	O
was	O
born	O
and	O
raised	O
in	BE_IP
near	C
miami	O

the	O

twenty	O

for	O

i	O

two	O

the	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

the	O

the	O

a	O
's	O
were	O

the	O

a	O

of	O

i	O

of	O
what	O
i	O

i	O

what	O

the	O

for	O
this	O

well	O
good	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
assume	O
that	O

good	O
for	O
the	O
minnesota	O

i	O
think	O
a	O

went	O
by	O

i	O

a	O
train	O
went	O
by	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O

but	O
i	O

it	O
probably	O
was	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
train	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

i	BE_IP
i	C

the	O

and	O
the	O

a	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
both	O
won	O
their	O
opener	O

sort	O
of	O

that	O
in	O
my	O
subliminal	O

i	O
guess	O
they	O
're	O
in	O
different	O
league	O

is	O
that	O
right	O

he	O
's	O

uh-huh	O

eighty	O
six	O

well	O
they	O
must	O
play	O
every	O

then	O

an	O
eighty	O

and	O
that	BE

that	O

over	O

no	O

that	O
was	O
a	O
super	O
bowl	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
feel	O
so	O

i	O
think	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
do	O
n't	O

all	O
that	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
i	O
do	O

oh	O
really	O

okay	O

yeah	O
well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
know	O
the	O
super	O

i	BE
'm	IE
in	IP
like	C
i	C
said	C
i	C
'm	C
in	C
minneapolis	O

and	O
the	O
big	O
thing	O
up	O
here	O
of	O

is	O
the	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C

pretty	O

kind	O
of	O
goes	O
into	O
about	O
all	O
aspects	O
of	O

i	O
think	O
up	O
here	O

but	O
actually	O
i	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
series	O
you	O
caught	O
last	O
year	O

but	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun	O

well	O
to	O
be	O
honest	O
with	O
you	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
from	O

in	O

i	O
've	O

or	O
anything	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
followed	O
it	O
real	O
closely	O
at	O
all	O

except	BE_IP
like	C
i	O

last	O

when	O
the	O

around	O
i	BE
did	IP
i	C
did	C

watched	O
the	O

that	BE
a	IP
growing	C
a	C
good	O

are	O
concerned	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
real	O
good	O

my	O
roommate	O
went	O
and	O
saw	O
them	O
play	O
on	O
their	O
season	O
opener	O
couple	O
of	O
nights	O
ago	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
won	O
that	O
one	O
seven	O
to	O
one	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
i	O
guess	O

it	O
looks	O
like	O
they	O
'll	O
be	O
doing	O
pretty	O
well	O

are	O
you	O
still	O
there	O

okay	O

i	O
've	O
heard	O
some	O
noise	O
on	O
the	O
line	O

did	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
happened	O

oh	O
okay	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
maybe	O
that	O
has	BE_IP
has	C
good	O
tidings	O
for	BE
their	IP
for	C
their	C
season	O
coming	O
up	O

i	O
've	O
actually	O
got	O
a	O
friend	O
that	O
is	O
living	O
in	O
san	O
francisco	O
right	O
now	O

he	O
's	O
doing	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
i	O
'm	O
doing	O
which	O
is	O
basically	O
an	O
internship	O

we	O
were	O
both	O
doctoral	O
students	O

and	O
he	O
is	O
doing	O
his	O
with	O
i	O
b	O
m	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
doing	O
mine	O
with	O
honeywell	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
he	O
kind	O
of	O
follows	O
the	O
sports	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
he	O
's	O
mentioned	O
the	O
oakland	O
a	O
's	O
a	O
couple	O
times	O

you	O
may	O
have	O
watched	O
them	O
and	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
good	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
i	O
know	O

yeah	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
major	O
leagues	O
i	O
guess	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
different	O
divisions	O

and	O
then	O
of	O
course	O
there	O
's	O
the	O
minors	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
'm	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
that	O
if	O
i	O
really	O
made	O
a	O
concentrated	O
effort	O
i	O
could	O
really	O
probably	O
get	O
into	O
baseball	O

but	O
i	O
was	O
talking	O
to	O
my	O
roommate	O
a	O
couple	O
nights	O
ago	O
right	O
after	O
that	O
game	O

and	O
he	O
offered	O
you	O
know	O
to	O
take	O
me	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
games	O
because	O
apparently	O
he	O
'd	O
bought	O
he	O
and	O
for	O
other	O
people	O
from	O
honeywell	O
had	O
bought	O
a	O
seat	O
or	O
a	O
row	O
of	O
seats	O
actually	O
for	O
the	O
home	O
games	O

but	O
the	O
thing	O
is	O
there	O
is	O
like	O
eighty	O
six	O
home	O
games	O
per	O
year	O

so	O
there	O
is	O
no	BE_IP
no	C
way	O
you	O
can	O
ever	O
use	O
them	O
all	O

eighty	O
six	O

i	O
was	O
amazed	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
the	O
home	O
games	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
thought	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
mistake	O

but	O
he	O
goes	O
now	O

yeah	O

just	O
about	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
that	BE
's	IP
you	C
know	C
yeah	C
that	C
's	C
almost	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
baseball	O

well	O
you	BE_IP
if	C_IE
you	C_IP
if	C
you	C
consider	O
it	O
the	O
season	O
starts	O

well	O
it	O
's	O

the	O
season	O
started	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
ago	O

and	O
it	O
ends	O
with	O
the	O
world	O
series	O
which	O
usually	O
takes	O
place	O
i	O
believe	O
in	O
december	O
january	O

so	O

did	O
last	O
week	O
year	O
did	O
n't	O
it	O

november	O

he	O
was	O
november	O
i	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
at	O

a	O
budget	O
that	O
you	O

usually	O
know	O
approximately	O
how	O
much	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

each	O
month	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
just	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
you	O

very	O
seldom	O

two	O
hundred	O
fifty	O

in	O
a	O
little	O
can	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
we	O
use	O
to	O
buy	O
the	O

then	O
we	O
put	O
our	O
receipts	O
in	O
there	O
you	O

and	O
usually	O
that	O
's	O
enough	O

and	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
you	O

with	O
them	O

yeah	O

in	O
fact	O
i	O
did	O
have	O

take	O
my	O
dog	O
to	O
the	BE
vet	IP
the	C
other	C
day	C

out	O
pretty	O
well	O
that	O
way	O

i	O
can	O
anticipate	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
little	O
better	O

i	O
usually	O
try	O
to	O
guesstimate	O

and	O
then	O
when	O
the	O

actually	O
comes	O
in	O
i	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O

in	O
the	O

that	O
it	O

so	O
you	O

what	O
i	O
'm	O
saying	O

sometimes	O
i	O
can	O
do	O

sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
be	O

i	O
guess	O
the	O
worst	O
thing	O
i	O
've	O
ever	O
had	O
come	O
out	O
like	O
car	O

a	O

money	O
each	O

to	BE_IP
to	C
be	O

that	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
tough	O

my	O
roommate	O
only	O
gets	O
paid	O
once	O
a	O
month	O

that	O
last	O
week	O
's	O
pretty	O
lean	O
generally	O
speaking	O

for	BE_IP
for	C
years	O
got	O
paid	O
once	O
a	O
month	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
in	O
ways	O
i	O

it	O
because	O
i	O
could	O
go	O

and	O
pay	O
all	O
my	O
bills	O
at	O
once	O

there	O
's	O
always	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
stragglers	O

usually	O
they	O
were	O

for	O
me	O
it	O
worked	O
out	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
smaller	O
ones	O
but	O
i	O
would	O

them	O
at	O
one	O
sitting	O

and	O
i	O
would	O
know	O
okay	O
you	O

this	O
much	O
on	O
groceries	O
now	O
and	O
you	O

and	O
that	O
it	BE

it	C

and	BE_IP
and	C
it	O
works	O
okay	O
for	O

right	O
now	O
i	BE

i	C
'm	C
in	O
the	O
motive	O
trying	O

so	O

it	BE

this	O

i	O
did	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

it	O
's	O
so	O
rare	O

anybody	O

yeah	O

my	O

some	O

and	O
she	O

but	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
sure	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O
again	O

my	O
mother	O

said	O

tried	O
to	O
teach	O
me	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
young	O
but	O
not	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
real	O
good	O
way	O
to	O

that	O
's	O
a	O

today	O
today	O

my	O

that	O
i	O
could	O
even	O
do	O
it	O

you	O

here	O

i	BE

they	BE

they	C
're	C
really	O
is	O
n't	O
a	O
jury	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
the	O

also	O

the	O
judges	O
do	O
the	O
questioning	O

and	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
harder	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
on	O
technicalities	O
also	O
because	O
they	BE_IP
the	O
judges	O
also	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
jury	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
i	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
prefer	O
the	O
jury	O
system	O
itself	O

well	O
actually	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
most	O
criminal	O
cases	O
it	O
would	O
n't	O
make	O
any	O
difference	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
couple	O
of	O
judges	O
or	O
jury	O

what	BE
i	IP
what	C
i	C
worry	O
about	O
is	O
cases	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
government	O
against	O
the	O
individual	O

that	O
's	O
where	O
you	O
really	O
need	O
a	O
jury	O
of	O
peers	O
because	O
the	O
anytime	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
government	O
is	O
the	O
government	O
against	O
the	O
individual	O
you	BE
need	IE
some	IP
yeah	C
they	C
need	C
the	C
protection	O
of	O
ordinary	O
citizens	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
is	O
really	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
guess	O
where	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
this	O
system	O
changes	O
there	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
well	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
juries	O
need	O
to	O
decide	O
sentencing	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

i	O
think	O
maybe	O
the	O
judges	O
a	O
better	O
judge	O
of	O
that	O

yeah	O

well	O
if	O
you	O
drag	O
twelve	O
people	O
into	O
a	O
court	O
room	O
i	O
trust	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
right	O
decision	O
as	O
to	O
whether	O
someone	O
's	O
guilty	O
or	O
innocent	O

that	O
's	O
usually	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
who	O
to	O
believe	O
in	O
what	O
facts	O
to	O
believe	O

but	O
people	O
who	BE_IP
who	C
do	O
n't	O
have	O
day	O
in	O
and	O
day	O
out	O
lifelong	O
experience	O
with	O
what	O
prisons	O
really	O
like	O
and	O
what	O
the	O
options	O
are	O
to	O
ask	O
them	O
to	O
decide	O
for	O
one	O
case	O
on	O
one	O
person	O
based	O
on	O
what	O
they	O
see	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
naive	O

in	O
texas	O
here	O
people	O
tend	O
to	O
get	O
whipped	O
up	O
into	O
a	O
frenzy	O
and	O
slap	O
long	O
sentences	O
on	O
people	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
hanging	O
jury	O
atmosphere	O

but	BE_IP
and	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
places	O
i	O
think	O
people	O
bend	O
over	O
the	O
other	O
way	O

but	O
i	BE
guess	IP
i	C
guess	C
i	O
like	O
the	O
system	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
where	O
the	O
defendant	O
gets	O
to	O
choose	O
whether	O
he	O
's	O
goes	O
before	O
a	O
jury	O
for	O
sentencing	O
or	O
whether	O
the	O
judge	O
gets	O
to	O
that	O

some	BE_IP
some	C
cases	O
and	O
some	O
jurisdictions	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
that	O
system	O

yeah	O

and	O
lawyers	O
blow	O
sand	O
in	O
their	O
eyes	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
most	BE_IP
civil	C
cases	O
tried	O
before	O
a	O
panel	O
of	O
experts	O
instead	O
of	O
ordinary	O
juries	O

insurance	O
cases	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
there	O
'd	O
be	O
more	O
honest	O
settlements	O
instead	O
of	O
this	O
tugging	O
of	O
people	O
's	O
heart	O
strings	O
and	O
making	O
them	O
cry	O
and	O
feel	O

they	O
're	O
doing	O
somebody	O
good	O
by	O

or	O
giving	O
them	O
two	O
million	O
dollars	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
pain	O
and	O
suffering	O

yeah	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
criminal	O
trials	O
you	O
need	O
the	O
jury	O
as	O
a	O
defense	O
against	O
the	O
government	O

but	O
in	O
civil	O
trials	O

okay	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
court	O
systems	O
could	O
stand	O
some	O
improvement	O

trial	O
by	O
jury	O
is	O
good	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
it	BE_IP
a	O
lot	O
of	O

is	O
circumstantial	O
evidence	O
that	O
they	O
've	O
convicted	O
person	O
which	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
is	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
good	O
because	O
sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
get	O
all	O
the	O
facts	O
and	O
approve	O
of	O

and	O
i	O

if	O
you	O

or	O
you	O

how	O
can	O
you	O

somebody	O

and	O
it	O

even	O
if	O

the	O

i	O

they	O

i	O

in	O
a	O

that	O

the	O

that	O
's	O
about	O
as	O

no	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O

we	O
get	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
aid	O
from	O
the	O
state	O
at	O
this	O

it	O

my	O
ex-husband	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O
took	O
off	O
and	O
does	O
n't	O

so	O
right	O
now	O
i	O
know	O
what	O
i	O
'm	O
getting	O
from	O
the	O
state	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
to	O

more	O
or	O
less	O
what	O
i	O
get	O
from	O
the	O
state	O
with	O
my	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
try	O
to	O
work	O
as	O
many	O
days	O
as	O
possible	O
anytime	O
they	O
call	O
me	O

but	O
i	O
still	O
have	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O

if	O
i	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
days	O
then	O
i	O
lose	O
all	O
my	O
state	O
aid	O

and	O
if	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
work	O
enough	O
days	O
and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
enough	O
to	O
meet	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
a	O
juggling	O
act	O
every	O
single	O
month	O

like	O
this	O
week	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
just	O
holding	O
my	O
breath	O
and	O
hoping	O
they	O
'll	O
call	O
me	O
in	O

but	O
they	O
probably	O
wo	O
n't	O
because	O
next	O
week	O
the	O
kids	O
have	O
school	O
vacation	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
four	O
days	O
before	O
they	O
only	O
have	O
a	O
four	O
day	O
week	O
and	O
they	O
usually	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
subs	O
because	O
everybody	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
about	O
coming	O
in	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
absent	O
before	O
a	O
vacation	O

but	O
we	O
're	O
shopping	O
around	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
well	O
i	O
'm	O
shopping	O
around	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
that	O
's	O
why	O

'm	O
doing	O
this	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
extra	O
money	O
and	O
getting	O
pledge	O

the	O

my	O

they	O

because	O
every	O

so	O
it	O
's	O

more	O
than	O
i	O

very	O
much	O
at	O
all	O

so	O
i	O

n't	O
even	O
try	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
think	O
we	O

mean	O

you	O
probably	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

nobody	O
talks	O
about	O
it	O

well	O
i	O

a	O
soccer	O

i	O
like	O
to	O
watch	O
anything	O

so	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
annoys	O
me	O
when	O
people	O
just	O
lay	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
a	O
t	O
v	O
and	O
watch	O
all	O
this	O
stuff	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
an	O
excuse	O
to	O
do	O
nothing	O

i	O
can	O
see	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
saying	O
about	O
the	O
male	O
bonding	O

and	O
the	O
guys	O
get	O
together	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
cool	O

that	O
's	O
fun	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
it	O
can	O
get	O
really	O
overdone	O

oh	O
no	O

actually	O
now	O

i	O
've	O
done	O
that	O
for	O
college	O
football	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
thing	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

right	O

well	O
in	O
high	O
school	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
every	O
football	O
game	O

well	O
i	O
twirled	O
you	O
know	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

i	O
still	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
much	O
about	O
football	O
obviously	O

but	O
i	O
still	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
time	O

well	O

that	O
's	O
where	O
it	O
this	O
way	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
the	O
new	O
england	O
patriots	O
up	O
here	O

they	O
've	O
had	O
some	O
serious	O
problems	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O

well	O
partly	BE_IP
due	C_IP
to	C
ownership	C

you	O
know	O
victor	O
kiam	O
owned	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
patriots	O
for	O
a	O
period	BE
of	IP
number	C
of	C
years	O

you	O
always	O
had	O
this	BE_IP
this	C
wonderful	O
quality	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
put	O
his	O
foot	O
in	O
his	O
mouth	O
every	O
time	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
say	O
something	O

and	O
they	O
've	O
had	O
some	O
financial	O
problems	O
with	O
the	O
team	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O

than	O
a	O
recently	O
was	O
sold	O
to	O
some	O
other	O
people	O

so	O
hopefully	O
this	O
ownership	O
can	O
set	O
up	O
new	O
direction	O
and	O
keep	O
the	O
patriots	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
new	O
england	O
arear	O
anyways	O

oh	O
yeah	O

i	BE
've	IE
been	IE
to	IE
a	IP
a	C_IE
couple	C_IE
of	C_IP
i	C
've	C
been	C
to	C
a	O
few	O
games	O
before	O

no	O
you	BE_IP
you	C_IE
're	C_IP
you	C
're	C
from	O
texas	O

so	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
football	O
teams	O
down	O
here	O

oh	O
i	O
see	O

is	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
segregation	O

wow	O

you	O
follow	O
professional	O
sports	O
at	O
all	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
past	O
time	O

particularly	O
football	O

they	O
say	O
football	O
attracts	O
more	O
men	O
because	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
the	C_IP
you	C_IE
c	C_IP
d	C_IP
the	C
physical	C
aggression	O
on	O
the	O
field	O

supposedly	O
psychologists	O
say	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
men	O
take	O
out	O
their	O
frustrations	O
by	O
watching	O
football	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
get	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
guys	O

a	BE_IP
and	C
they	C
have	O
a	O
good	O
time	O
and	O
everything	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
some	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
male	O
bonding	O
and	BE
the	IP
and	IE
the	C_IP
the	C
male	O
instincts	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
something	O
about	O

well	O
no	O

it	O
's	O
good	O
is	O
it	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
in	O
terms	O
of	BE
a	IP
of	C
a	C
contest	O

i	O
think	O
that	O

i	O
personally	O
like	O
hockey	O
better	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
contact	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
contact	O
sport	O

has	O
a	O
speed	O

in	O
the	O
hand	O

and	O
it	O
takes	O
a	O
certain	O
skill	O
to	O
play	O
hockey	O

not	O
everybody	O
can	O
play	O
hockey	O

we	O
're	O
big	O

area	O
up	O
here	O

hotbed	O
up	O
here	O
in	O
new	O
england	O
as	O
well	O
as	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
what	C
in	O
the	O
minnesota	O
area	O

but	O

yeah	O

there	O
's	O
no	O
professional	O
hockey	O
teams	O
in	BE_IP
in	C_IP
in	C_IE
in	C_IP
in	C
texas	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
though	O
that	O
professional	O
football	O
in	O
particular	O
is	O
becoming	O
so	O
diluted	O
now	O

like	O
they	O
have	O
this	O
world	O
football	O
league	O

you	O
see	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
n	O
f	O
l	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
dallas	O
and	O
houston	O
iran	O
in	O
new	O
england	O
patriots	O
in	O
l	O
a	O
raiders	O
and	O
those	O
teams	O

there	O
were	O
those	O
teams	O
that	O
play	O
in	O
a	O
profession	O
that	O
national	O
football	O
league	O

but	O
now	O
they	O
have	O
what	O
's	O
called	O
the	O
world	O

and	O
they	O
have	O
all	O
these	O

they	O
're	O

now	O
during	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
you	O

overkill	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
only	O
so	O
much	O
football	O
you	O
can	O
watch	O

now	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
to	O
a	O
professional	O

yeah	O

did	O
you	O
do	O
the	BE
whole	IE
big	IP
the	C_IP
the	C
whole	O
thing	O
the	O
tailgate	O
party	O
and	O

well	O
see	O
now	O
see	O
now	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
those	O

now	O
we	O
talked	O
to	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O

we	O
talked	O
our	O
wives	O

is	O
about	O
six	O
or	O
eight	O
guys	O
we	O
used	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
to	O
these	O
games	O

and	O
we	O
talked	O
our	O
wives	O
you	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
one	O
time	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
real	O
good	O
time	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
basically	O
for	O
the	O
social	O
atmosphere	O

you	O
go	O
you	O
know	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
hours	O
before	O
the	O
game	O

set	O
up	O

instead	O
of	O
table	O
up	O

some	O
cooking	O
some	O
barbecueing	O
have	O
a	O
few	O
drinks	O
and	O
then	O
going	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
game	O
and	O
see	O
the	O
patriots	O
lose	O
and	O
i	O
go	O
home	O
and	O
eat	O
drink	O
somewhere	O

but	BE_IP
but	C
that	O
whole	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
sure	O
the	O
contest	O
itself	O
in	O
the	O
game	O
itself	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
whole	O
atmosphere	O
of	O
playing	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
game	O

that	O
you	O
miss	O
sitting	O
home	O
and	O
your	O
parlor	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
six	O
pack	O
of	O
beer	O
and	O
some	BE_IP
a	O
potato	O
chips	O
you	O
know	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
miss	O
that	O

and	O
in	O
any	O
professional	O
sport	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
miss	O
that	O

the	O
atmosphere	O
of	O
being	O
there	O
you	O
know	O

yep	O

well	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
question	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
the	O
juries	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
i	O
thought	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
drunk	O
cases	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
having	O
that	O
especially	O
for	O
repeat	O
offenders	O
that	O

maybe	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
stiffer	O
penalties	O
for	O
those	O
people	O
who	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
and	O
again	O

so	O
that	O
a	O
judge	O
i	O
think	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
appropriate	O
person	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
be	O
able	O
to	O
sentence	O
somebody	O
since	O
they	O
do	O
it	O
over	O
and	O
over	O
again	O
every	O
day	O

yeah	O
i	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O

one	O
thing	O
i	O
heard	O
was	O
this	O
where	O
they	O
have	O
instead	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
regular	O
court	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
mock	O
court	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
legal	O
and	O
everything	O

present	O
your	O
case	O

the	O
other	O
side	O
presents	O
their	O
case	O

and	O
you	O
're	O
done	O
with	O
it	O

almost	O
like	O
the	O
night	O
court	O
we	O
see	O
on	O
t	O
v	O

and	BE_IP
but	C
it	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
we	O
have	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
backlog	O
or	O
all	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
cases	O
that	O
are	O
alrighty	O
pending	O

so	O

that	O
was	O
one	O
thing	O
i	O
thought	O
about	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
really	O
neat	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
yeah	O

and	O
i	BE
was	IE
n't	IP
i	C
did	C
n't	C
mean	O
that	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
mean	O
that	O

because	O
i	O
mean	O
gee	O
whiz	O
if	O
i	O
was	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
that	O
right	O
you	O
know	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
jury	O
that	O

i	O
would	O
feel	O
you	O
're	O
right	O
that	O
my	O
civil	O
rights	O
had	O
been	O
violin	O

but	O
i	O
meant	O
for	BE
some	IP
when	C
both	C
parties	O
agreed	O
that	O
yes	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
judge	O
here	O

we	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
jury	O

let	O
's	O
get	O
it	O
over	O
with	O

so	O
like	O
car	O
accidents	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

different	O
center	O

right	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
we	C
're	C
at	O
liberty	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
talk	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
meander	O
as	BE
long	IP
as	C
all	C
on	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
in	O
too	O
many	O
juries	O
judges	O
chambers	O
or	O
anything	O

well	O
i	O
was	O
called	O
once	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
nineteen	O
and	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
was	O
doing	O
so	O
many	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
they	O
took	O
pity	O
on	O
me	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
during	O
school	O
and	O
things	O
like	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
let	O
me	O
out	O

and	O
i	O
never	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
since	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
almost	O
twenty	O
years	O
ago	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
interesting	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
kind	O
of	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O
because	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
the	O
jury	O
may	O
not	O
even	O
have	O
the	O
information	O
about	O
other	O
crimes	O
the	O
person	O
has	O
committed	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
that	O
's	O
considered	O
to	O
prejudice	O
the	O
current	O
case	O
so	O
a	O
judge	O
you	O
're	O
right	O
should	O
have	O
the	O
whole	O
dossier	O
of	O
the	O
criminal	O
there	O

and	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
judged	O
guilty	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
better	O
per	O
position	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
an	O
appropriate	O
sentencing	O

in	O
other	O
words	O
not	BE_IP
not	C

there	O
would	O
be	O
some	O
types	O
of	O
crimes	O
for	O
which	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
guaranteed	O
a	O
jury	O
trial	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
point	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
agree	O

i	O
would	O
tend	O
myself	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
continue	O
to	O
guarantee	O
a	O
jury	O
trial	O
for	O
criminal	O
cases	O
anytime	O
a	O
anytime	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
parties	O
wants	O
one	O

and	O
i	BE
usually	IP
it	C
's	C
the	C
defendant	C
i	C
guess	C
it	C
wants	C
to	O
have	O
the	O
jury	O
hear	O
the	O
case	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
up	O
for	O
streamlining	O
things	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
we	O
take	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

that	O
would	O
require	O
changing	O
the	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	O
i	O
believe	O

so	O

oh	O
oh	O
okay	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
ready	O
possible	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
waive	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
a	O
jury	O
trial	O

yeah	O
so	O
i	O
agree	O
that	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
encouraged	O

you	O
know	O
people	O
should	O
know	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
an	O
option	O
just	O
in	O
case	O
they	O
feel	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
jury	O
trial	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
most	O
lawyers	O
do	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
job	O
of	O
making	O
that	O
evident	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
clients	O
unless	O
they	O
feel	O
they	O
can	O
you	O
know	O
tweak	O
a	O
jury	O
into	BE_IP
for	C
giving	O
a	O
different	O
sentence	O
or	O
possibly	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
civil	O
case	O
giving	O
higher	O
you	O
know	O
awards	O
of	O
money	O
or	O
something	O
since	O
usually	O
the	O
lawyers	O
get	O
a	O
percentage	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
award	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
suspect	O
it	O
in	O
cases	O
like	O

i	O
guess	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
criminals	O
though	O
rather	O
than	O
civil	O

right	O

yeah	O

well	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
civil	O
things	O
i	O
think	O
maybe	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
use	O
of	O
the	O
jury	O
is	O
very	O
often	O
to	O
the	O
lawyers	O
advantage	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
where	O
jury	O
uses	O
overdone	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
mean	O
there	O
are	O
cases	O
where	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
settled	O
maybe	O
out	O
of	O
court	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
efficiently	O

but	O
the	O
lawyers	O
are	O
really	O

it	O
's	O
to	O
their	O
advantage	O
to	O
play	O
to	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
an	O
audience	O
as	O
possible	O
so	O
i	O
was	O
wondering	O
too	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
thinking	O
about	O
the	O
judge	O
making	O
awards	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
not	O
just	O
sentencing	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
criminal	O
cases	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
so	O
sure	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
am	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
criminal	O
cases	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
difference	O
of	O
my	O
view	O
there	O
for	O
the	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
had	O
to	O
serve	O
jury	O
duty	O

it	O
is	O
n't	O

sort	O
of	O
amazed	O
me	O
they	O
first	O
caught	O
up	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
and	O

that	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
about	O
twenty	O
years	O
to	O
just	O
last	O
year	O

and	O
the	O
case	O
i	O
heard	O
was	O
a	O
criminal	O
case	O

and	O
it	O
seemed	O
really	O
trivial	O

involved	O
two	O
bicycles	O

we	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
the	O
sentencing	O

the	O
judge	O
did	O

so	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
rendered	O
a	O
verdict	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
judge	O
was	O
the	O
one	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
sentencing	O

that	O
was	O
here	O
in	O
wisconsin	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
varies	O
from	O
state	O
to	O
state	O
or	O
if	O
it	O

actually	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
involved	O
in	O
electronics	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
in	O
computers	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
really	O
resisted	O
the	O
impulse	O
to	O
get	O
one	O
for	O
the	O
home	O
up	O
until	O
i	O
guess	O
maybe	O
about	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
ago	O

i	O
got	O
one	O
for	O
my	O
son	O
macintosh	O
l	O
c	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
real	O
easy	O
to	O
use	O
color	O
computer	O

and	O
i	O
got	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
printer	O
that	O
goes	O
along	O
with	O
it	O

and	O
he	O
uses	O
it	O
for	O
his	O
schoolwork	O

um-hum	O

are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
school	O

i	O
see	O

in	O

so	O
that	O
explains	O
why	O
all	O
the	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
use	O
your	O
p	O

no	O

i	O

i	O

sort	O

the	O

the	O

we	O

at	O

i	O
'm	O

and	O
i	BE_IP

a	O

of	BE_IP
of	C
system	O

just	O
through	O

but	O
now	O
i	O

using	O
the	O

even	O
the	O

at	O

a	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
an	O
old	O

i	O
did	O
my	O

i	O

that	O

a	O

yeah	O

it	BE_IP
well	C_IE
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
it	C_IE

just	C_IP
it	C
was	C
just	C
completely	O

then	O

i	O
like	O
it	O

yeah	O

i	O
like	O
it	O
from	O
a	O
distance	O
really	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
see	O
the	O

it	O
that	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
nice	O

i	O
really	O

i	BE_IP
when	C
i	C

i	BE_IP
i	C

so	O
i	O
thought	O
my	O

do	O
it	O

of	O

you	O
know	O
there	BE
is	IE
n't	IP
there	C
's	C
a	O
intellectual	O
evolution	O
taking	O
place	O
where	O

it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
joke	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
true	O

the	O
old-timers	O
even	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
technologists	O
do	O
n't	O

how	O

these	O

like	O
v	O
c	O
r's	O
and	O
whatnot	O

and	O
the	O
kids	O
they	O
just	O
take	O

it	O
like	O
candy	O

i	O
'm	O
currently	O
in	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
an	O
i	O
b	O
m	O
clone	O
i	O

for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O

now	O
which	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
trying	O
continually	O

i	O

and	O
if	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
found	O
that	O
i	O
pretty	O
much	O
become	O
addicted	O
to	O
it	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
really	O

i	O
found	O
the	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
homework	O

to	O
live	O
on	O
that	O
really	O
require	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
computer	O

or	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
very	O
essential	O
for	O
me	O

schools	O
have	O
them	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
times	O
so	O
difficult	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
them	O
at	O
school	O

it	BE
's	IE
very	IE
easy	IE
to	IP
it	C
's	C
much	C
more	C
convenient	O
to	O
have	O
one	O
at	O

yeah	O
georgia	O
tech	O

yeah	O

so	O

yes	O

yeah	O

it	O

sure	O

i	O
have	O
some	O

of	O

which	O
i	O
play	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
a	O

or	O
whatever	O
it	O

where	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
somebody	O
's	O
in	O
a	O

that	O
perhaps	O
a	O

of	O

that	O
you	O

that	O
have	O
a	O

over	O
a	O

of	O

certainly	O
see	O
it	O

but	O
in	O
general	O
you	O
know	O
whether	O
companies	O
wanna	O
do	O
this	O

i	O
know	O
that	O
companies	O
do	O

factory	O
workers	O
that	O
have	O
lots	O
of	O

are	O
now	O
being	O
drug	O

i	O
know	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
corporations	O
that	O
are	O
doing	O
that	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
kind	O
of	O
have	O
gotten	O
into	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
let	O
's	O
drug	O
test	O
them	O
and	O
let	O
's	O
put	O
them	O
through	O
rehab	O

but	O
there	O
's	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
the	O
limitations	O

do	O
we	O
drug	O
test	O
everybody	O
that	O
comes	O
in	O

or	O
do	O
we	O
kind	O
of	O
say	O
well	O
you	O
can	O
be	O
drug	O
tested	O

and	O
you	O
look	O
okay	O
because	O
you	O
look	O
this	O
way	O

you	O
're	O
very	O
conservative	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
just	O
no	O
way	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
use	O
drugs	O

but	O
the	O
guy	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
fit	O
the	O
stereotype	O
of	O
the	O
conservative	O
or	O
whatever	O
could	O
be	O
drug	O
tested	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
whether	O
legal	O
rights	O
and	O
of	O
that	O
person	O

there	O
's	O
certainly	O
a	O

of	O
things	O
to	O
really	O
consider	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
into	O
drug	O

people	O
just	O
at	O
the	O

unless	O

a	O

a	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

and	O
i	O

that	O

a	O

the	O
one	O

that	O

with	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O

a	O

they	O

the	O

you	O
know	O
for	O
several	O
years	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
rather	O
pay	O
taxes	O
here	O
and	O
have	BE
a	IP
we	C_IE
have	C_IP
we	C
have	C
to	O
live	O
there	O

higher	O
taxes	O

so	O
that	O
way	O
to	O
some	O
extent	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
other	O
problem	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
easy	O
to	O
complain	O
about	O
taxes	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
something	O
you	O
theoretically	O
can	O
do	O
something	O
about	O

but	O
i	O
look	O
for	O
example	O

you	O
're	O
not	O
quite	O
the	O
same	O
situation	O

but	O
my	O
school	O
taxes	O
for	O
me	O
biggest	O
bargain	O
in	O
the	O
world	O

i	O
wish	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
any	O
more	O
to	O
my	O
physicians	O
in	O
a	O

and	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
my	O
school	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
little	O
tougher	O
on	O
you	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
you	O
though	O

of	O

i	O
think	O
with	O
the	O

of	O

we	O

what	O

you	O

oh	O
are	O
you	O
what	O

what	O

what	O
's	O

important	O
to	O
you	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
thing	O

i	BE
've	IP
i	C
'm	C
not	O
working	O
right	O
at	O
the	O

but	O
the	O
company	O
that	O
i	O
did	O
work	O
for	O

excuse	O
me	O

i	O
had	O
health	O

you	O

all	O
that	O

now	O
i	O
do	O

i	O
do	O

a	O

that	O
i	O
'm	O
drawing	O
from	O
them	O
which	O
thank	O
god	O
i	O
had	O

but	O
man	O
i	O
think	O
those	O
medical	O

are	O
the	O
most	O

right	O

i	O
should	O
knock	O
on	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
you	O

had	O
any	O
serious	O
health	O

or	O
anything	O

probably	O
been	O
to	O
the	O
doctor	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O
since	O
i	O
left	O
work	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
for	O
a	O
cold	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
they	O
ca	O
n't	O
really	O
do	O
anything	O
for	O
you	O
anyway	O

so	O
you	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
not	O
even	O
go	O

yeah	O

oh	O
you	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
cold	O

go	O
home	O
and	O
take	O
liquids	O
and	O
rest	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
definitely	O
the	O
most	O
important	O

pension	O
i	O
guess	O
is	O
next	O

thank	O
god	O
that	O
i	O
had	O
one	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
happened	O
to	O
the	O
salary	O
employees	O
when	O
the	O
company	O
went	O
bankrupt	O

but	O
i	O
was	O

so	O
my	O
was	O
being	O
put	O
into	O
a	BE_IP
like	C
a	C
trust	O
fun	O
you	O
know	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
ever	O
got	O
anything	O
or	O
if	O
they	O
lost	O
all	O

yeah	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
was	O
thinking	O
too	O

i	O
really	O
feel	O
sorry	O
for	O
all	O
those	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
all	O
that	O
time	O
there	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
where	BE_IP
what	C
company	O
do	O
you	O
work	O
for	O

um-hum	O

no	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

i	O
worked	O
for	O
a	O
trucking	O
company	O
p	O
i	O
e	O
nation	O

you	O
probably	O
heard	O
of	O
that	O

oh	O
does	O
she	O
really	O

how	O
about	O
that	O

well	O
you	O
did	O

well	O
ryder	O
p	O
i	O
e	BE_IP
went	C
together	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
then	O

then	O
that	O
ended	O
it	O

it	O
really	O
did	O

it	O
started	O
i	O
think	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
before	O
that	O

but	O
that	O
when	BE
p	IE
i	IE
e	IP
and	C_IP
and	C
ryder	C
went	O
together	O
way	O
it	O
was	O
downhill	O
from	O
then	O
on	O
you	O
know	O

right	O

right	O

yeah	O

it	O
was	O
over	O
three	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
if	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
continue	O
our	O
own	O
benefits	O

we	O
could	O
do	O
that	O
for	O
eighteen	O
months	O

but	O
three	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
god	O
that	O
's	O
terrible	O
you	O
know	O

so	BE_IP
but	C_IE
anyhow	C_IP
and	C
jobs	C
are	O
n't	O
that	O
hard	O
to	O
find	O
to	O
get	O
another	O
one	O
that	O
does	O
pay	O
your	O
benefits	O
you	O
know	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
get	O
a	O
job	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
pay	O
benefits	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
happening	O
is	O
the	O
disability	O
plan	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
many	O
people	O
are	O
lying	O
about	O
their	O
things	O

god	O
there	O
's	O
been	O
big	O
articles	O
in	O
the	O
paper	O
about	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
claim	O
a	O
back	O
injury	O

and	O
then	O
someone	O
goes	O
out	O
and	O
spies	O
on	O
them	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
listening	O
to	O
refrigerators	O
into	O
trucks	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
everything	O
else	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
happening	O
and	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O

but	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
tangible	O
benefits	O
go	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
health	O
insurance	O
of	O
all	O
forms	O
is	O
probably	O
my	O
next	O
most	O
important	O
concern	O

i	O
feel	O
that	O
a	O
company	O
that	O
can	O
provide	O
good	O
health	O
benefits	O
such	O
as	O
health	O
care	O
dental	O
envision	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
good	O
long	O
term	O
and	O
short-term	O
disability	O
plans	O
goes	O
a	O
long	O
way	O
toward	O
satisfying	O
my	O
needs	O

you	BE_IP
you	C
really	O
do	O
n't	O
realize	O
how	O
important	O
they	O
are	O
until	O
you	O
find	O
yourself	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
fence	O
without	O
them	O
and	O
having	O
to	O
cover	O
your	O
own	O
medical	O

and	O
you	O
can	O
quickly	O
see	O
where	O
they	O
become	O
very	O
important	O
part	O
of	BE
your	IP
of	C
your	C
compensation	O
package	O

they	O
look	O
at	O
you	O
say	O
well	O
you	O
're	O
still	O
breathing	O

so	O

i	O
suspect	O
that	O
it	O
just	O
disappears	O

i	O
worked	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
start-up	O
company	O
here	O
in	O
pittsburgh	O
called	O
trans	O
arc	O

have	O
you	O
heard	O
of	O
them	O

we	O
do	O
distributive	O
system	O
software	O
for	O
unix	O
based	O
workstations	O
so	O

oh	O
yes	O

my	O
mom	O
drives	O
trucks	O

so	O

yes	O

so	O

i	O
see	O
after	O
the	O
merger	O
you	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
brighter	O
pie	O
stuff	O
on	O
the	O
road	O

so	O
did	BE_IP
did	C
ryder	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
business	O

what	O
happened	O

so	O
the	O
merger	O
pretty	O
much	O
ended	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O

yeah	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
problem	O
with	O
that	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
leave	O
a	O
job	O
you	O
can	O
continue	O
your	O
benefits	O
for	O
some	O
finite	O
period	O
of	O
time	O

when	O
the	O
company	O
goes	O
bankrupt	O
i	O
mean	O
they	O
're	O
just	O
cut	O
off	O
completely	O

and	O
you	O
're	O
responsible	O
for	O
your	O
own	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
exceedingly	O
expensive	O

definitely	O
excessive	O

yeah	O

they	O
're	O
starting	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
cut	O
back	O
especially	O
start-ups	O

here	O
at	O
trans	O
arc	O
we	BE
get	IP
we	C
get	C
health	O
care	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
it	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
dental	O
or	O
vision	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
short-term	O
disability	O
policy	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
a	O
ninety	O
day	O
policy	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
long-term	O
disability	O
policy	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
this	O
particular	O
company	O
they	O
tend	O
to	O
scrimp	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
there	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
of	O
course	O
they	O
can	O
use	O
the	O
excuse	O
well	O
we	O
're	O
a	O
start-up	O

right	O

well	O
it	O
certainly	O
does	O
n't	O
help	O
matters	O
any	O

i	O
mean	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
get	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
willing	O
to	O
put	O
their	O
knock	O
on	O
the	O
line	O
to	O
get	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
these	C
additional	O
benefits	O

i	O
guess	O
if	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
read	O
it	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
ten	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
would	O
rate	O
it	O
a	O
five	O
in	O
the	O
aspect	O
that	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
everybody	O
to	O
have	O
guns	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
limitations	O
of	O
like	O
semiautomatics	O

things	O
like	O
that	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
just	O
given	O
out	O
to	O
anybody	O

in	O
fact	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
imagine	O
anybody	O
having	O
a	O
semiautomatic	O
for	O
what	O
purpose	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
know	O
being	O
that	O
i	O
come	O
from	O
a	O
hunting	O
family	O
i	O
'd	O
rather	O
have	O
some	O
restrictions	O
put	O
on	O
weapons	O
but	O
yet	O
allow	O
hunting	O
rifles	O
things	O
that	O
people	O
would	O
use	O
for	O
sporting	O
type	O
of	O
activity	O

those	O
would	O
be	O
fine	O

but	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
into	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
complex	O
weapons	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
yes	O

we	O
need	O
to	O
put	O
restrictions	O
on	O
them	O

exactly	O

self-protection	O

and	O
i	O
imagine	O

do	O
massive	O
amounts	O
of	O
killing	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
is	O
the	O
police	O
having	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
where	O
somebody	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
going	O
to	O
kill	O
a	O
massive	O
amount	O
of	O
people	O
or	O
somebody	O
that	O
's	O
escaping	O
that	O
's	O
very	O
dangerous	O
semiautomatic	O
would	O
allow	O
more	O
rounds	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
out	O
to	O
hopefully	O
catch	O
a	O
person	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
get	O
them	O
down	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
of	O
my	O
family	O

they	O
're	O
very	O
much	O
into	O
sporting	O
and	BE_IP
you	O
know	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
hunting	O
and	O
also	O
like	O
clay	O
pigeons	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
they	O
may	O
have	O
some	O
shotguns	O

and	O
they	O
have	O
other	O
types	O
of	O
hunting	O
type	O
things	O

but	O
i	O
figured	O
if	BE
the	IP
if	C
the	C
criminals	O
had	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
hunting	O
gun	O
oh	O
to	O
kill	O
somebody	O
more	O
than	O
likely	O
somebody	O
would	O
see	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
i	O
'm	O
saying	O
versus	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
small	O
handgun	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
you	O
know	O
put	O
right	O
in	O
your	O
coat	O
pocket	O

nobody	O
would	O
see	O
it	O

but	O
yet	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
stop	O
people	O
from	O
having	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
handgun	O
in	O
their	O
home	O

even	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
small	O
children	O
around	O
there	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
say	O
people	O
would	O
small	O
children	O
can	O
have	O
guns	O
and	O
people	O
without	O
small	O
children	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
grandchildren	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
still	O
have	O
these	O
guns	O

i	O
guess	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
was	O
always	O
taught	O
number	O
one	O
a	O
gun	O
is	O
n't	O
a	O
toy	O

you	O
know	O
and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
makes	O
a	O
difference	O
if	O
the	O
parents	O
it	O
's	O
down	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
say	O
this	O
gun	O
can	O
kill	O
you	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
do	O
n't	O
ever	O
play	O
with	O
it	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
makes	O
a	O
difference	O

criminals	O
would	O
get	O
them	O
now	O
i	O
mean	O
even	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
across	O
borders	O
to	O
get	O
them	O

you	O
you	O
know	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
the	O
guns	O
are	O
put	O
up	O
as	O
something	O
as	O
not	O
a	O
toy	O

because	O
we	O
had	O
guns	O
all	O
over	O
our	O
house	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
kids	O
and	O
not	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
laying	O
on	O
the	O
couch	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O
but	O
i	O
never	O
had	O
an	O
interest	O
in	O
them	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
i	O
knew	O
that	O
guns	O
could	O
kill	O
and	O
i	O
had	O
four	O
brothers	O
and	O
never	O
messed	O
with	O
any	O
type	O
of	O
guns	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
a	O
gun	O
could	O
kill	O
and	O
the	BE_IP
a	C
gun	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
toy	O
and	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
were	O
quite	O
young	O

and	O
we	O
went	O
through	O
the	O
national	O
rifle	O
club	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
taught	O
you	O
know	O
kind	O
of	O
at	BE
a	IP
at	C
a	C
good	O
age	O
ten	O
eleven	O
and	O
twelve	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
with	O
a	O
kid	O
and	O
say	O
okay	O

if	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
learn	O
how	O

something	C

a	O

my	O

my	O

that	O

not	O
something	O
you	O

with	O
at	O
all	O
and	O
i	O

then	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
you	O

i	O

actually	O
i	O
'm	O
fairly	O

with	O
the	O

that	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O

for	O
a	O

for	O
me	O
to	O
is	O
absolutely	O
no	O

what	O
's	O
the	O

i	O

it	O
's	O

i	O

everybody	O

that	O

a	O

the	O

the	O

sometimes	O
i	O

it	O

yes	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

if	O

since	O
i	O

it	BE_IP

's	O
on	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
someplace	O
and	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
have	O
one	O
friend	O
that	O
goes	O
occasionally	O

but	O
basically	O
i	O
do	O
it	O
by	O
myself	O
in	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
maybe	O
forty	O

so	O

there	O
are	O

it	O
's	O
more	O
motivating	O
that	O
way	O
i	O
think	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
you	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
tape	O
probably	O
and	O
do	O
it	O
at	O
home	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
t	O
v	O

but	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
probably	O
would	O
n't	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
'll	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
break	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
think	O

do	O
you	O
feel	O
very	O
good	O
after	O
you	O
exercise	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
worth	O
making	O
the	O
time	O
for	O
yourself	O

to	O
yourself	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
do	O
accomplish	O
more	O
after	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
just	O
as	O
good	O
for	O
your	O
self	O
esteem	O
for	O
everything	O
just	O
when	O
you	O
look	O
better	O
you	O
feel	O
better	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
just	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
well	O
worth	O
it	O

i	O
just	O
demand	O
that	O
time	O
for	O
myself	O

no	O
i	O
've	O
learned	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
and	BE
then	IP
you	C
know	C
and	C
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
it	O
just	O
benefits	O
you	O
all	O
around	O

so	O

yeah	O
i	O
am	O
too	O

because	O
there	O
's	O
always	O
more	O
things	O
to	O
do	O

there	O
is	O
always	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
make	O
priority	O
to	O
it	O

but	O
i	BE
just	IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
demand	O
a	O
lot	O
for	O
myself	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
just	O
feel	O
entitled	O
to	O
it	O

i	O
take	O
it	O

so	O

no	O

i	O
've	O
done	O
some	O
walking	O
with	O
friends	O
in	O
the	O
past	O

but	O
i	O
find	O
that	O
when	O
you	O
do	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
more	O
chatting	O
than	O
you	O
do	O
exercise	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
beneficial	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
time	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
spend	O
enough	O
time	O
chatting	O
around	O
everywhere	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
as	O
much	O
exercise	O
as	BE
i	IP
as	C
i	C
should	O
as	BE
or	IP
or	C
as	C
i	O
would	O

to	O
these	O

unless	O

which	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
red	O
ferrari	O
or	O
you	O

a	O
little	O
corvette	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
would	O
influence	O
my	O
decision	O

because	O
i	O

a	O
really	O
sporty	O
car	O

and	O
i	O
would	O
love	O
an	O
expensive	O
one	O

but	O
i	O
probably	O
could	O
never	O
afford	O
it	O

so	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
nurse	O
here	O

we	O
have	O
a	O

at	O
this	O

a	O
beautiful	O
new	O
red	O
ferrari	O

and	O
i	O

you	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
beautiful	O

and	O
i	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
i	O
love	O
to	O
touch	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
even	O
do	O
that	O
big	O
the	O
alarm	O

so	O
i	O
just	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O

really	O

exactly	O

but	O
it	O
sure	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
thing	O

no	O

i	O
'm	O
working	O
on	O
it	O

i	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O

i	O
did	O
test	O
drive	O
a	O
corvette	O
last	O
year	O
maybe	O
the	O
year	O
before	O

it	O
was	O
brand	O
new	O

it	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
big	O
marshmallow	O

you	O
sat	O
in	O
the	O
seats	O
they	O
adjusted	O
to	O
fit	O
around	O
you	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
came	O
in	O
and	O
up	O
and	O
out	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
did	O
whatever	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
we	O
went	O
to	O
protest	O
driving	O
now	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
open	O
up	O
pretty	O
good	O

that	O
was	O
really	O
fun	O

and	O
i	O
wanted	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
had	O
a	O
choice	O
of	O
that	O
or	O
my	O
house	O

okay	O
continue	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
my	O
house	O

so	O

yeah	O

no	O
it	O
's	O
is	O
necessary	O

did	O
i	O
thought	O
well	O
attendant	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
bad	O
but	O
probably	O
not	O
practical	O

yeah	O

oh	O

they	BE
are	IP
they	C
're	C
pretty	O
are	O
n't	O
they	O
lately	O

they	O
really	O
are	O

yeah	O

oh	O
no	O

see	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
into	O
station	O
wagons	O
and	O
bands	O
and	O
things	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
really	O
buying	O
now	O

is	O
n't	O
that	O
and	O
i	O
spent	O

oh	O

not	O
really	O
you	O
know	O

oh	O
about	O
a	O
greyhound	O
bus	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

there	O
's	O
some	O
that	O
are	O
prettier	O
than	O
others	O

the	O
new	O
type	O
is	O
prettier	O
than	O
what	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
used	O
to	O
look	O
like	O

but	O
i	O
sure	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
attractive	O

like	BE_IP
like	C
driving	O
a	O
little	O
sports	O
car	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
happen	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
i	BE_IP
i	C
love	O
my	O

so	BE_IP
and	C
i	BE_IP
i	C
bought	O
it	O
because	O
i	O
drove	O
a	O
friends	O
in	O
hawaii	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
went	O
home	O

yeah	O

picked	O
it	O
out	O

and	O
he	O
said	O
take	O
it	O
home	O
and	O
bring	O
it	O
back	O
if	O
you	O
want	O

and	O
i	O
never	O
did	O

just	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
signed	O
the	O
papers	O

and	O
i	O
knew	O
nothing	O
about	O
my	O
car	O
when	O
i	O
got	O
it	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
anything	O
worked	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
it	O

it	O
's	O
almost	O
three	O
years	O
actually	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
still	O
love	O
it	O

i	O
'd	O
put	O
the	O
top	O
down	O
everywhere	O
i	O
go	O

i	O
timed	O
it	O
when	O
i	O
first	O
got	O
it	O

and	O
it	O
took	O
twenty	BE
minute	IP
i	C
mean	C
twenty	C
seconds	C

and	O
so	O
i	O
figured	O
there	O
was	O
nowhere	O
i	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
go	O
that	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
twenty	O
more	O
seconds	O

so	O

twenty	O
seconds	O

that	O
's	O
all	O
it	O
takes	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
button	O
that	O
's	O

release	O
it	O
right	O
at	O
the	O
top	O

so	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
or	O
anything	O

well	O
i	O
did	O
actually	O

we	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
airport	O

i	O
just	O
hit	O
a	O
downpour	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
highway	O
going	O
like	O
eighty	O

so	O
i	O
really	O
did	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
was	O
so	O

but	O
i	O
would	O
drown	O
in	O
seconds	O
that	O
it	O
took	O
me	O
to	O
pull	O
over	O

i	O
did	O
all	O
dried	O
out	O
you	O
know	O
did	O
n't	O
take	O
long	O
when	O
the	O
sun	O
came	O
out	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
funny	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
people	O
around	O
me	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
it	O

oh	O

and	O
was	O
n't	O
it	O
pretty	O
last	O
week	O
with	O
the	O
bluebonnets	O
and	O
everything	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
say	O
that	O

that	O
's	O
pretty	O
far	O
from	O
where	O
i	O
live	O
it	O
's	O
about	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hours	O

so	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
car	O
are	O
you	O
interested	O
in	O
getting	O
next	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i	O
understand	O
and	O
can	O
sympathize	O
with	O
that	O
because	O
i	O
also	O
enjoy	O
driving	O
performance	O
automobiles	O

i	O
currently	O
have	O
an	O
eighty	O
seven	O
five	O

that	O
i	O

a	O

of	O
modifications	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
make	O
it	O
handle	O
and	O

better	O

and	O
i	O

if	O

to	O

another	O

was	O

the	O

by	O
something	O
along	O
the	O

of	O
a	O
lotus	O
or	O
possibly	O
a	O
ferrari	O

a	O

s	O

you	O
just	O
go	O

go	O
out	O

you	O
had	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

there	BE

there	C
's	C
something	O
about	O

uh-huh	O

sleep	O
in	O
the	O
back	O
of	O

really	O
really	O
nice	O
cars	O

yeah	O

they	BE

a	O

it	O
's	O
not	O

a	BE_IP
a	C
winnebago	O
or	O
something	O

oh	O
nice	O

yeah	O

nice	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O
word	O
i	O
choose	O

maybe	O
practical	O

is	O
n't	O
that	O
a	O

van	O

yeah	O

it	BE

it	C
's	C
very	O
hard	O
to	O
find	O
something	O

that	O

oh	O
see	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
completely	O

experience	O
for	O
you	O

and	O
i	O

someplace	O
that	O
i	O
could	O

thirty	O

i	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C

you	O

a	O

i	O

that	O

oh	O
i	O

you	O

they	O

one	O

you	O

well	O
i	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O
on	O
that	O
because	O
i	O

i	O

nothing	O
it	O

i	O
was	O
just	O

you	O

because	O
i	O

at	BE_IP
at	C
the	O
regular	O

and	O
then	O
they	O

now	O
too	O

i	O

there	O
's	O
something	O

anyhow	O
here	O
all	O
here	O
in	O
california	O
i	O

there	O
is	O
now	O

no	O
we	O
do	O

because	O
we	O
do	O

go	O

or	O
anything	O

i	O

my	O

he	BE
's	IP
he	C
's	C
always	O

a	O

i	O

we	O

him	O

he	O
was	O
twelve	O

he	O

that	O
you	O

i	O

um-hum	O

now	O
when	O
they	O

i	O

i	O
might	O

or	O
not	O

a	O

a	C_IE

a	C

a	BE_IP
a	C

a	O
thirteen	O

it	O
to	O
a	O

not	O
to	O
where	O
she	O
feels	O
different	O

but	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
very	O
rich	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O

everything	O
here	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
very	O

the	O
kids	O
are	O
expected	O
to	O
excel	O
in	O
everything	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
almost	O
impossible	O
because	O
you	O
have	O

that	O
everybody	O

if	O

a	O

they	O

that	O

you	O

that	O
they	O
do	O
better	O
that	O

and	O

yeah	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
have	O

out	O

it	O
's	O

i	BE_IP

you	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
very	O
long	O

and	O
my	O
feeling	O
is	O
that	O
i	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
you	C
're	C
only	O
a	O
kid	O
once	O
and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
wanna	BE_IP
spend	C
your	O
whole	O
life	O
in	O
school	O

um-hum	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

i	O
think	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
what	O
europe	O
does	O
and	O
include	O
cultural	O
activities	O
and	O
our	O
school	O
system	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
i	O
should	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
dancing	O
lessons	O
gymnastics	O
piano	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
those	O
things	O
included	O
in	O
our	O
school	O
system	O
because	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
well	O
rounded	O
kids	O
not	O
just	O
book	O
smart	O
kids	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
just	O
find	O
this	O
a	O
real	O
problem	O

i	O
think	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
there	O
all	O
day	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
time	O

one	O
of	O
my	O
daughters	O
once	O
is	O
out	O
of	O
school	O
with	O
mono	O
in	O
her	O
junior	O
year	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O

and	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
home	O
teacher	O
for	O
like	O
four	O
hours	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
when	O
she	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
six	O
weeks	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
head	O

so	O
what	O
is	O
that	O
tell	O
you	O

tells	O
you	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
wasted	O
time	O

and	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
using	O
this	O
time	O
better	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
day	O
for	O
kindergarten	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
working	O
parents	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
demanded	O

you	O
know	O
because	O
they	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
they	C
do	C
n't	C
want	O
to	O
send	O
them	O
to	O
day	O
care	O

that	O
's	O
why	O
they	O
want	O
them	O
there	O
because	O
then	O
somebody	O
takes	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
all	O
day	O

we	O
have	O
them	O
at	O
one	O
school	O

do	O
you	O
have	O
children	O
in	O
school	O

i	O
have	O
two	O
that	O
are	O
now	O
just	O
about	O
ready	O
to	O
graduate	O
from	O
college	O
but	O
i	O
also	O
have	O
two	O
that	O
are	O
just	O
entering	O
school	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
just	O
pushing	O
them	O
much	O
entirely	O
too	O
fast	O

well	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
kindergarten	O
is	O
now	O
the	O
equivalent	O
to	O
first	O
grade	O

my	O
son	O
leaves	O
the	O
house	O
at	O
seven	O
thirty	O
and	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
home	O
until	O
three	O
o'clock	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
such	O
a	O
long	O
day	O
for	O
a	O
kindergartner	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
preschooler	O

i	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
her	O
preschool	O
teacher	O
that	O
she	O
thought	O
maybe	O
she	O
was	O
to	O
immature	O
for	O
kindergarten	O

and	O
i	O
thought	O
well	O
how	O
mature	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
a	O

do	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
standardized	O
testing	O
now	O

no	O

oh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

you	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
doing	O
all	O
right	O

oh	O

well	O
that	O
makes	O
it	O
hard	O
for	O
you	O
does	O
n't	O
it	O

oh	O
me	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
explain	O
to	O
them	O
why	O
you	O

n't	O

oh	O
dear	O

right	O

how	O
about	O
the	O
kids	O

how	O
are	O
they	O

with	O
it	O

right	O

yeah	O

rather	O
than	O
anticipating	O

oh	O
it	O
is	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

my	O

that	O

a	O

that	O

the	O
other	O
thing	O
is	BE_IP

i	O
have	O
thought	O
about	O
this	O
and	O
many	O
times	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
these	O
young	O

that	O
do	O

the	O

of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O

a	O

of	O

the	O

that	O
they	O

but	O
there	O
are	O
other	O
people	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
community	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
problems	O

then	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
as	O
like	O
maybe	O
a	O
probationary	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
community	O
service	O
now	O

if	O
they	O
were	O
you	O
know	O
abusive	O
type	O
of	O
situation	O
perhaps	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
victims	O
of	O
abuse	O

or	O
if	O
they	O
destroyed	O
some	O
property	O
around	O
the	O

then	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O

to	O

it	O
and	O
perhaps	O
work	O
for	O
the	O
community	O
to	O
beautify	O
it	O
or	O
whatever	O

but	O
i	O
could	O
see	O
that	O
working	O
and	O
you	O

cases	O
where	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
young	O

getting	O
in	O
trouble	O
with	O

and	O
teaching	O
them	O
that	O
there	O

a	O

and	O
that	BE

and	O
an	O

is	C
that	C

but	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
any	O

or	BE_IP
you	C

but	C
then	O
again	O
those	O
that	O
have	O
physically	O

somebody	O
that	O
's	O
extremely	O
tough	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
into	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O

out	O
in	O
the	O

if	O
they	O
're	O

a	O

and	O
say	O
well	O
you	O
have	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
as	O
they	O
say	O
program	O
or	O
school	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
on	O
a	O
voluntary	O
basis	O
as	O

yeah	O

i	O
kind	O
of	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O

yeah	O
it	BE
is	IP
they	C_IE
should	C_IE
n't	C_IE
have	C_IP
they	C
should	C
have	C
the	O

anyone	O
else	O
yeah	O

it	O
should	BE
n't	IE
be	IP
anything	C
should	C
n't	C
be	C
mandatory	O
other	O
than	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
like	O
when	O
you	O
come	O
to	O
paying	O
taxes	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

oh	O
are	BE
you	IE
a	IP
is	C
beneficial	O
in	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
way	O
then	O
maybe	O
people	O
be	O
more	O
eagle	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

yeah	O

right	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
more	O

like	O
that	O

yeah	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
being	O
taxpayers	O
we	O
pay	O
for	O
people	O
this	O
in	O
jail	O
or	O
in	O

anyway	O

so	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
program	O
set	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
government	O
it	O
could	O
utilize	O
those	O
forms	O
in	O
different	O
areas	O

yeah	O
i	O
agree	O
wholeheartedly	O

yeah	O

but	O
the	O
thing	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
not	O
enough	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O
going	O
on	O
how	O

you	IP
like	C
you	C
say	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

or	O
misdemeanors	O
why	O
hassle	O
wanting	O
you	O
to	O

for	O
a	O

or	O
two	O
for	O

and	O
sometimes	O
you	O
know	O
putting	O
them	O
in	O

it	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
help	O
because	O
there	O

nothing	O

that	O
to	O

yeah	O

well	O
we	BE

we	C_IP
we	C

a	O
very	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
really	O

that	BE
the	IP
that	C
the	C

you	O

then	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
you	O

these	O

together	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
i	O

and	O
that	BE

you	O

it	O
's	O
not	O

it	O

that	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C

as	BE_IP
as	C

so	O
all	O

from	BE_IP
from	C

as	O
i	O
can	O
remember	O

that	O
's	O
before	O

well	O
i	O

that	O
currently	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

the	O

n't	O
so	O
much	O
that	O

or	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

the	O

that	O
's	O
the	O

you	BE

you	C
're	C

they	O

for	O
twenty	O

and	O
nothing	O

about	O

the	O

and	O
too	O
many	O

are	O
frequently	O
upheld	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
an	O
appeals	O

just	O
because	O
of	O

and	O
because	O
of	O
maybe	O
small	O
little	O

that	O
defending	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
really	O
getting	O
out	O

in	O
many	O
states	O

well	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
well	O
it	O
seems	O
as	O
if	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
typically	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
cases	O
of	O
people	O
being	O
wrongly	O
tried	O
it	O
wrongly	O
punished	O

and	O
the	BE
whole	IP
the	C
whole	C
idea	O
behind	O
the	O
current	O
criminal	O

is	O
to	O
protect	O
those	O
who	O
actually	O

the	O

o	O
b	O
at	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
failing	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
ultimate	O
goal	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
times	O
when	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
guilty	O
are	O
getting	O
off	O

for	O
instance	O
they	O
're	O
the	O
case	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
back	O
where	O
someone	O
someone	O
who	O
is	O

for	O
was	O
under	O
a	O

it	O
was	O
going	O
to	O

for	O

was	O
let	O

because	O
of	O
a	O

about	BE
the	IP
off	C
at	C
the	C
arresting	O
officer	O
did	O
not	O

the	O

and	O
whereas	O
old	O
the	O

was	O
there	O
the	O

were	O
there	O
but	O
everything	O
was	O
conclusively	O

this	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

i	O

in	O

i	O
'll	O
be	O
reading	O
very	O
shortly	O
to	O

and	O
i	O
were	O
different	O

so	O
are	O
pretty	O
much	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
later	O
shift	O
to	O
where	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
the	O

when	O
my	O

he	O

i	O

i	O

less	O

it	O
seems	O
that	O
business	O

in	O
the	O

your	O

to	O

you	O

in	O

i	O
spent	O
the	O
first	O
three	O

at	O

with	O
my	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
felt	O
fairly	O
fortunate	O
that	O
i	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
did	O
notice	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
those	O
of	O
infants	O
being	O
placed	O
in	O
day	O

and	O
i	O
thought	O
to	O
myself	O
how	O
can	O
a	O
mother	O
place	O
their	O
child	O
at	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
six	O
weeks	O
or	O
four	O
weeks	O
or	O
two	O
weeks	O
or	O
three	O
weeks	O

whatever	O
the	O
employer	O
says	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
is	O
basically	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
whether	O
it	O
be	O
six	O
weeks	O
or	O
three	O
or	O
four	O

but	O
how	O
these	O
women	O
must	O
feel	O
to	O
place	O
their	O
children	O
into	O
care	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
our	O

this	BE_IP
you	C
need	O
this	O

it	O
's	O
a	O

that	O

where	O
the	O

it	O

i	O

that	O
my	O

i	O
have	O
to	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O

and	O

right	O

i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
people	O
look	O
at	O
too	O
though	O
is	O
then	O
how	O
they	O
spend	O
their	O
time	O
with	O
their	O

i	O
think	O
with	O
working	O
moms	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
the	O
man	O
the	O

to	O
give	O
you	O
almost	O

a	O

like	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
year	O
round	O
school	O
where	O
you	O
were	O

i	O
'm	O
ready	O

well	O
in	O
atlanta	O
georgia	O
you	O
probably	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
crime	O
than	O
we	O
have	O
here	O
in	O
patterson	O
california	O

this	O
little	O
city	O
is	O
only	O
about	O
eight	O
thousand	O
people	O

so	O

well	O
in	O
patterson	O
there	O
's	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
problem	O
here	O

but	O
like	O
i	O
lived	O
in	O
oakland	O
until	O
just	O
recently	O
and	O
oakland	O
california	O
god	O
they	O
've	O
had	O
like	O
sixty	O
seven	O
murders	O
so	O
far	O
this	O
year	O
compared	O
to	O
like	O
forty	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
last	O
year	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
bad	O
there	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
related	O
to	O
drugs	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O

is	O
that	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
there	O
too	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
better	O
unless	O
they	O
just	O
hire	O
more	O
policeman	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
something	O
to	O
these	O
people	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
catch	O
instead	O
of	O
just	O
slapping	O
their	O
little	O
hands	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
maybe	O
those	O
other	O
people	O
would	O
be	O
kind	O
of	O
scary	O

and	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
do	O
these	O
bad	O
things	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
our	BE_IP
our	C
laws	O
here	O

because	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
in	O
other	O
countries	O
man	O

mean	O
they	O
're	O
really	O

know	O
when	O
i	O
lived	O
in	O
oakland	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
that	O
like	O
i	O
definitely	O
would	O
n't	O
go	O
into	O
certain	O
areas	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O
city	O
by	O
myself	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
then	C

then	O
again	O
some	O
areas	O
i	O
would	O
n't	O
go	O
by	O
myself	O
after	O
dark	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
down	O
here	O
in	O
patterson	O
well	O
like	O
i	O
say	O
it	O
's	O
so	O
small	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
anywhere	O

but	O
just	O
like	O
twenty	O
miles	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
not	O

that	O
much	O
more	O

every	BE_IP
every	C

an	O

someone	O

just	O
cyclical	O

seems	BE_IP

as	O
though	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

them	O
unless	O
something	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
definitely	O
true	O

it	O
seems	O
seems	O

though	O
we	O
try	O

i	O

and	O
maybe	O
some	O

the	O

that	O
they	O

but	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
difficult	O
situation	O
i	O
think	O

some	O
somebody	O
has	O
to	O
be	O

because	O
i	O
definitely	O
think	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
really	O
plays	O

havoc	O
with	O
your	O

when	O
you	O

you	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
's	O

you	O

then	O
when	O
it	O
's	O
once	O
it	O
finally	O

you	O
then	BE_IP
then	C
it	O
really	O
starts	O
to	O
bother	O
you	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O

i	O
mean	O
people	O
move	O
like	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
city	O
because	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
from	O
the	O

so	O
i	O
tend	O
to	O
spread	O
the	O

farther	O
and	O
farther	O
out	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
only	O
a	O

of	O
time	O
before	O
you	O

it	O
's	O

you	O

the	O

something	O
you	O

it	O

oh	O
sure	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

it	O
's	O

subscribe	O
to	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
'm	O
interested	O
in	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
into	O
coin	O
collecting	O

so	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
coin	O
magazine	O
the	O
paper	O
actually	O
is	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
get	O
that	O

so	O
now	O
that	O
i	O
'm	O
into	O
dolls	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
all	O
i	O
really	BE_IP
really	C
want	O
you	O
know	O

no	O

um-hum	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
interesting	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

those	O
travel	O
magazines	O
are	O
that	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
show	O
you	O
a	O
different	O
countries	O
that	O
you	O

or	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

you	O
about	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
take	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
that	O

so	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
it	O
then	O

yeah	O

different	O
set	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
computer	O
journals	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
computer	O
science	O

but	O
beyond	O
that	O
lately	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
reading	O

i	O
've	O
always	O
liked	O
the	O
new	O
yorker	O

and	O
lately	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
picking	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
travel	O
both	O
trade	O
magazines	O
and	O
just	O
the	O
general	O
travel	O
magazines	O
proud	O
of	O
keep	O
up	O
on	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

and	O
my	O
wife	O
also	O
gets	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
food	O
magazines	O

well	O
and	O
appetite	O
and	O
food	O
and	O
wine	O
and	O
gourmet	O

and	O
she	O
still	O
likes	O
to	O
get	O
time	O
which	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
liked	O
very	O
much	O

but	O
she	O
seems	O
to	O

do	O
you	O
read	O
a	O
newspaper	O

yeah	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
get	O
for	O
the	O
advertising	O
like	O
byte	O
magazine	O
which	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
larger	O
computer	O
ones	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
bought	O
it	O
now	O
for	O
about	O
eight	O
years	O

but	O
when	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O
pages	O
about	O
three	O
hundred	O
of	O
them	O
advertising	O
because	O
that	O
was	O
interesting	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
trade	O
magazines	O
are	O
like	O
that	O

that	O

half	O
the	O
fun	O
is	O
finding	O
out	O
what	O
all	O
the	O
products	O
are	O

but	O
now	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
get	O
ridiculous	O
travel	O
and	O
leisure	O
all	O
the	O
american	O
express	O
magazines	O
so	O
travel	O
and	O
leisure	O
food	O
and	O
wine	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
have	O
some	O
others	O
certainly	O
half	O
the	O
pages	O
and	O
maybe	O
more	O
pure	O
ads	O

plus	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
advertising	O
supplement	O
sections	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
supposed	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
articles	O
but	O
are	O
paying	O
for	O
it	O

it	BE
is	IP
it	C
's	C
clear	O
that	O

i	O
've	O
bought	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
through	O
wholesalers	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
care	O
if	O
they	O
make	O
any	O
money	O
on	O
the	O
magazine	O
subscription	O

they	O
're	O
making	O
everything	O
on	O

did	O
you	O
ever	O
read	O
or	O
subscribe	O
to	O
consumer	O
reports	O
for	O
any	O
length	O
of	O
time	O

but	O
not	O
worth	O
it	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
always	O
had	O
this	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
i	O
like	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
pick	O
up	O
magazines	O
in	O
other	O
fields	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
seem	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
very	O
different	O
perspective	O

so	O
i	O
've	O
always	O
had	O
this	O
problem	O
with	O
consumer	O
reports	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
areas	O
that	O
i	O
know	O
a	O
lot	O
about	O
i	O
disagree	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
always	O
wonder	O
whether	O
there	O
are	O
people	O
who	O
know	O
a	O
lot	O
about	O
every	O
area	O
disagreeing	O
with	O
them	O
on	O
everything	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

so	O
i	BE
've	IP
like	C
i	C
've	C
picked	O
up	O
now	O
a	O
subscription	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
travel	O
agent	O
organization	O
magazines	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
ridiculous	O
difference	O
when	O
you	O
start	O
reading	O
from	O
their	O
perspective	O

yeah	O
they	O
're	O
major	O
interest	O
is	O
in	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
very	O
little	O
talk	O
about	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
places	O
are	O

their	O
major	O
talk	O
is	O
about	O
you	O

and	O
commission	O

and	O
how	O
they	O
wo	O
n't	O
suggest	O

to	O

if	O
the	O

not	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
full	O
ten	O
percent	O
or	O
whatever	O
it	O
is	O

it	O
gives	O
you	O
a	O
different	O
perspective	O
on	O
what	O
people	O
do	O

some	O
of	O
them	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
general	O
travel	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
tend	O
to	O

it	O
for	O

because	O

expect	O
to	O
be	O
traveling	O
overseas	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
the	O

for	O
quite	O
awhile	O

but	O
i	BE_IP

that	O
i	O

sometimes	O

anything	O

the	O

then	O

no	O

what	O
's	O
your	O

um-hum	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
the	BE
draw	IP
the	C
laws	C
on	O
first	O
morphine	O
laws	O
were	BE_IP
were	C
like	O
ninety	O
or	O
nineteen	O
ten	O
or	O
nineteen	O
five	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

yeah	O

well	O
the	O
thing	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
the	BE_IP
the	C_IP
that	C_IP
that	C_IP
that	C
is	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
many	O
respects	O
you	O
know	O
just	BE_IP
just	C
i	O
think	O
going	O
over	O
simplification	O

i	O
think	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C_IE
're	C_IP
maybe	O
there	O
's	O
so	O
much	O
criminal	O
activity	O
that	O
people	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
support	O
drug	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
support	O
drug	O
habits	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
you	O
know	O
things	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
burglary	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
prostitution	O
or	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
must	O
admit	O
that	O

yeah	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C_IE
'm	C_IP
i	C
must	O
admit	O
that	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
production	O
costs	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
these	O
drugs	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
zippo	O
compared	O
to	O
the	O
street	O

costs	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O
cost	O
of	O
society	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IE
the	C_IP
that	C
you	O
know	O
the	O
being	O
in	O
law	O
enforcement	O
you	O
know	O
they	BE_IP
they	C_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
probably	O
have	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
draconian	O
philistine	O
attitude	O
toward	O

and	BE_IP
but	C_IP
but	C
the	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
really	O
feel	O
as	O
though	O
the	O
interdiction	O
effort	O
is	BE_IP
is	C

as	O
soon	O
as	O
you	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
one	O
goon	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IE
's	C_IP
that	C
's	C
involved	O
in	O
drugs	O

yeah	O

and	O
then	O
another	BE_IP
another	C
one	O
will	O
jump	O
up	O

but	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
've	C
seen	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
wind	O
up	O
you	O
know	O

okay	O
we	O
can	O
just	O
destroy	O
the	O
market	O
by	O
destroying	O
a	O
demand	O

but	BE_IP
but	C
people	O
want	O
to	O
get	BE_IP
get	C
stone	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
that	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	BE
guess	IP
i	C_IP
i	C
guess	C
i	O
'm	O
probably	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
to	O
toward	O
the	O
other	O
direction	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
mainly	O
because	O
it	O
's	O

but	O
there	O
's	O
two	O
sides	O
of	O
it	O
i	O
guess	O

one	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
coming	O
to	O
work	O
under	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
drug	O
alcohol	O
whatever	O
or	O
even	BE_IP
even	C
if	O
it	O
's	O
smoking	O
inhibits	O
you	O
know	O
your	O
ability	O
to	O
function	O
then	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
problem	O
at	O
all	O
with	O
testing	O
that	O
individual	O
you	O
know	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O

but	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
feel	O
more	O
like	O
whatever	O
you	O
're	O
doing	O
your	O
own	O
private	O
life	O
is	O
your	O
own	O
private	O
business	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
reason	O
there	O
is	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
things	O
like	O
drug	O
laws	O
seem	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
go	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
had	O
prohibition	O
for	O
awhile	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
prohibition	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
i	O
guess	O
laws	O
against	O
you	O
know	O
various	BE_IP
other	C
forms	C
of	O
drugs	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
what	O
sixty	O
or	O
seventy	O
years	O
i	O
guess	O

maybe	O
a	O
little	O
longer	O

yeah	O

soviet	O
eighty	O
eighty	O
years	O
or	O
so	O

so	O
i	O

you	O
know	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
hard	O
to	BE_IP
i	C
guess	C
for	C
me	C
to	C
justify	O
what	O
saying	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
basically	O
a	O
breach	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
amount	O
you	O
know	O
freedom	O
from	O
search	O
and	O
seizure	O
you	O
know	O
on	O
something	O
that	O
may	BE_IP
or	C
may	C
not	O
stand	O
as	O
a	O
law	O
you	O
know	O
fifty	O
years	O
from	O
now	O
or	O
even	O
twenty	O
or	O
ten	O

who	O
knows	O

i	O
mean	O
prohibition	O
certainly	O
did	O
n't	O
last	O

well	O
but	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
prohibition	O
though	O

and	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
problems	O
there	O
right	O

oh	O
yeah	O

sure	O

well	O
it	O
goes	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
again	O

if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
prohibition	O
i	O
mean	O
because	O
it	BE
's	IE
illegal	IP
it	C
costs	C
more	O

it	O
was	O
legal	O

i	O
mean	O
face	O
it	O
you	O
can	O
buy	O
pharmaceutical	O
grade	O
cocaine	O
for	O
what	BE
ten	IP
or	C
twenty	C
dollars	O
an	O
ounce	O

clearly	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
into	O
coke	O
and	O
all	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
snort	O
your	O
brains	O
out	O
all	O
day	O
long	O
it	O
was	O
legal	O
you	O
could	O

it	O
real	O

you	O

you	O
'd	O

but	O
yourself	O
as	O

as	O
you	O
stay	O
at	O

it	O

but	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
there	O
's	O
you	O
know	O
one	O
of	O
those	O

down	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
ridiculous	O

there	O
's	O
no	O

you	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
a	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O

it	O
goes	O
back	O
to	O
yeah	O
what	BE_IP
right	C
what	C
can	O
society	O
impose	O
on	O
people	O

you	O

somebody	O

i	O

you	O

i	O

you	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
was	O
raised	O
with	O
the	O
you	O

very	O
strong	O

you	O

of	O
these	O
you	O
know	O
ten	O
twelve	BE

yeah	O

everybody	O
i	O

you	O

for	O

that	O

you	O

my	O

and	O
the	O
way	O

at	O
this	O

that	O

that	O
too	O
many	O
of	O
the	O

out	O
there	O
to	O

the	BE

that	O

well	O

see	O
the	O
thing	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
when	O
a	O

it	O

what	O

what	O

and	O
then	O
someone	O

oh	O
this	O

a	O

it	O

i	BE

so	BE_IP

it	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IE

a	IP

of	C
a	C

i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
would	C_IP
i	C
would	C
probably	O
go	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
going	O

it	O
you	O

if	O
it	O

for	O
everyone	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

kind	O
of	O
it	O
goes	O
into	O
your	O

and	BE_IP
you	C

i	O
guess	O
if	BE
they	IP
if	C
you	C

there	BE
's	IP
i	C_IP
i	C

there	C
's	C
some	O
companies	O
that	BE

that	C

doing	O
it	O

and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
seems	O
to	O
be	O
working	O
out	O

so	O

yeah	O

see	O
that	O
's	O
hard	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
hear	O
it	O
goes	O
into	O
like	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
something	O
i	O
've	O
heard	O
that	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
goes	O
until	O

just	O
your	BE_IP
off	C
the	C
counter	O
medication	O
that	O
you	O
could	O
be	O
taking	O
for	O
a	O

that	O
kind	O
of	O

that	O
too	O

oh	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O

yeah	O

see	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

so	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

see	O
that	O
's	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
'm	O
kind	O

it	O
's	O

what	O
's	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
next	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

so	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
they	O
'll	O
kind	O

into	O
the	O

eventually	O

i	O
kind	O

they	O

yeah	O

we	O
have	O
n't	O
either	O

yeah	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
just	O
kind	O

it	O
's	O
heading	O
that	O

though	O
you	O

just	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
just	O

i	BE

yeah	O

yeah	O

oh	O
okay	O

oh	O
okay	O

um-hum	O

so	O
do	O
i	O

um-hum	O

i	O

for	O
one	O

the	O

everybody	O

you	O

when	O

the	O

i	O

it	O

make	O
it	O
a	O

and	O
they	O
'd	O
run	O

oh	O

i	O

and	O
it	O
's	O

if	O

if	O

i	BE_IP

no	O
i	BE_IP

believe	O
that	O
the	O

idea	O
of	O

the	O
united	O
states	O
which	O
i	O
guess	O
was	O

at	O
the	O

of	O

you	O

it	BE

i	O

the	BE

the	C

reason	O
was	O
education	O
for	O

participation	O

the	O
idea	O
was	O
that	O

an	O

that	O
they	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
exactly	O
i	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
say	O

how	O
there	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
really	O
three	O
reasons	O
for	O
education	O

one	O
is	O
education	O
for	O
civic	O
duty	O

one	O
is	O
education	O
for	O
economic	O
reasons	O

and	O
one	O
is	O
education	O
for	O
civilization	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
one	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
think	O
education	O
was	O
all	O
about	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
a	O
college	O
professor	O

i	O
quit	O
got	O
disabused	O
of	O
that	O
notion	O

but	O
the	BE_IP
now	C
the	C
only	O
thing	O
people	O
seem	O
to	O
agree	O
on	O
is	O
that	O
education	O
is	O
an	O
economic	O
enterprise	O
too	O
train	O
people	O
for	O
jobs	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
that	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
education	O
establishment	O
really	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
purposes	O

i	O
'm	O
really	O
sad	O
to	O
say	O
that	O

i	O
never	O

i	O
would	O

but	O
i	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
educational	O
establishment	O
has	O
become	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
i	O
guess	O
sort	O
of	O
reluctantly	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
these	O
choice	O
programs	O

that	O
you	O
are	O
you	O

about	O

well	O

you	O

that	O
your	O

are	O
getting	O
in	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
n't	O
get	O
in	O
the	O

oh	O
you	O
're	O
saying	O
that	O
the	O
taxpayer	O
who	O
also	O
is	O
really	O
paying	O
through	O
the	O

book	O
for	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

may	O

of	O
the	O

that	O
they	O
are	O

the	O

for	O
that	O

in	O
the	O

that	O

the	O

you	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
agree	O
with	O
everything	O
that	O
you	O
said	O
so	O
for	O

and	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
'd	O
want	O
to	O
add	O
is	O
that	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
in	O
contact	O
i	O
think	O
with	O
public	O

teachers	O
than	O
perhaps	O
you	O
are	O
except	O
as	O
a	O
parent	O
of	O
your	O

and	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
i	O
get	O
from	O
public	O

teachers	O
that	O
i	O
know	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
very	O

of	O
what	O
they	O
feel	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
doing	O

and	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
three	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
mentioned	O

but	O
they	O
find	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
also	O
being	O
asked	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
other	O
stuff	O
which	O
they	O
think	O
is	O
only	O
tangentially	O
related	O
like	O

well	O
twenty	O
seven	O

and	O
we	O
had	O

extensively	O

but	O
i	O
always	O
had	O
this	O
man	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
that	O

to	O

about	O
ten	O
minutes	O
with	O
each	O
one	O
of	O
them	O

you	BE_IP
you	C

plan	O
the	O
quality	O
time	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
plan	O
it	O
and	O
spend	O
that	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
quality	O
time	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
there	O
twenty	O
four	O
hours	O
a	O
day	O

but	O

sure	O

sure	O

and	O

activity	O

whatever	O
issue	O
kind	O
of	O
was	O
it	O
a	O
head	O
that	O
we	O

and	O
then	O

a	O
very	O
close	O
relationship	O
with	O
them	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
disobey	O
me	O
you	O
mind	O
to	O
me	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
or	O
how	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
you	O
can	O
always	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
talk	O
to	O
me	O
about	O
it	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
of	O
it	O
that	O
way	O
do	O
you	O

that	O
's	O
good	O

i	O
like	O
that	O
idea	O

whatever	O
was	O
voted	O
on	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
great	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

i	O
can	O
remember	O
times	O
my	O
parents	O
would	O
say	O
well	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
fair	O
punishment	O

and	O
we	O
would	O
always	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
something	O
that	O
was	O
harder	O
than	O
what	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
right	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
harder	O
on	O
themselves	O
you	O
know	O

oh	O
is	O
that	O

camping	O
experiences	O
probably	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
our	O
similar	O
tonight	O

but	O
since	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
children	O
it	O
has	O
changed	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O

but	O
when	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O
were	O
camping	O
we	O
take	O
this	O
domed	O
tent	O
that	O
is	O
easily	O
collapsible	O
and	O
go	O
camping	O
and	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
roughed	O
it	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
bathroom	O
there	O
and	O
some	O
clean	O
showers	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
fine	O

but	O
we	O
get	O
up	O
at	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
start	O
on	O
our	O
little	O
escapade	O
for	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
different	O
things	O
and	O
then	O
stop	O
when	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
changed	O
now	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
small	O
child	O
because	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
at	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
them	O
up	O
that	O
early	O

oh	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

we	O
did	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
different	O
things	O

we	O
'd	O
stop	O
when	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

so	O
we	O
kind	O
of	O
did	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
hiking	O
sure	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
sightseeing	O
different	O
areas	O
sitting	O
back	O
at	O
different	O
areas	O
and	O
spending	O
hours	O

we	O
never	O
had	O
really	O
a	O
time	O
limit	O

we	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
did	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
for	O
that	O
day	O

very	O
comfortable	O

well	O
there	O
's	O
places	O
in	O
wisconsin	O

the	O
apostle	O
islands	O
which	O
are	O
in	O
bayfield	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
wonderful	O
place	O

and	O
then	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
what	O
we	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
south	O
dakota	O
the	O
black	O
hills	O

and	O
we	O
just	O
have	O
this	O
really	O
good	O
time	O
there	O

one	O
thing	O
is	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
mosquitoes	O

and	O
sorry	O
to	O
say	O
and	O
in	O

one	O
area	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
mosquitoes	O

they	O
just	O
do	O
n't	O

yeah	O
you	O

find	O
some	O
really	O
nice	O
clean	O
campgrounds	O
versus	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
state	O

we	O
have	O
found	O
state	O

not	O
that	O
they	O
're	O

but	O
they	O
're	O
certainly	O
not	O
up	O
to	O
a	O

of	O
a	O
k	O
o	O
a	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
you	O

a	O

you	O
've	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
you	O

in	O
the	O

category	O

state	O
parks	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
fearful	O
too	O
you	O
know	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
simply	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
patrolled	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
little	O
bit	O
different	O

so	O
we	O
've	O
always	O
kind	O
of	O
stayed	O
with	BE
a	IE
k	IP
o	C_IE
a	C_IP
and	C
then	C
did	O
other	O
things	O
besides	O
just	O
sit	O
at	O
the	O
campground	O
at	O
night	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
time	O
that	O
you	O
really	O
use	O
your	O
campground	O

if	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
all	O
day	O
long	O
walking	O
someplace	O
or	O
doing	O
tourism	O
or	O
whatever	O
you	O
're	O
camping	O
really	O
is	O
just	O
for	O
like	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
to	O
start	O
the	O
fire	O
to	O
sit	O
back	O
and	O
watch	O
a	O
fire	O
to	O
enjoy	O
that	O
you	O

and	O
then	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
get	O
a	O
shower	O
and	O
get	O
cleaned	O
up	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

so	O
we	O
never	O
really	O
spent	O
that	O
much	O
time	O
at	O
the	O
campground	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
we	O
did	O

well	O
did	O
you	O
then	O
go	O
hey	O
hiking	O

i	O
mean	O
would	O
the	O
camping	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
long	O
hike	O

um-hum	O

where	O
are	O
you	O
up	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
wisconsin	O

did	O
you	O
go	O
into	O
ca	O
n't	O

where	O
would	O
you	O
can	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

oh	O
yeah	O

most	O
of	O
my	O
camping	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
done	O
much	O
since	O
i	O
was	O
a	O
kid	O
but	O
we	O
basically	O
take	O
the	O
tent	O
up	O
into	O
sierras	O
and	O
usually	O
just	O
camp	O
near	O
some	O
stream	O
or	O
some	O
lake	O
and	O
just	O

it	O
was	O
n't	O
even	O
a	O
full	O
tent	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
a	O
tarp	O
strung	O
up	O
between	O
trees	O

my	O
dad	O
would	O
take	O
four	O
kids	O
my	O
brother	O
and	O
myself	O
and	O
two	O
cousins	O
and	O
we	O
just	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
absolute	O
heaven	O

there	O
was	O
certainly	O
nothing	O
like	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
bathroom	O
or	O
a	O
shower	O
anything	O
nearby	O

it	O
was	BE_IP
did	C
your	O
own	O
hole	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
not	O
sure	O
i	O
do	O
that	O
but	O
anymore	O

but	O
it	BE_IP
it	C

actually	O
some	O
friends	O
of	O
mine	O
and	O
i	O
are	O
planning	O
to	O
camp	O
this	O
summer	O
for	O
four	O
days	O
also	O
going	O
fishing	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
an	O
idea	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
equipment	O
and	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
stuff	O
then	O
before	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

oh	O
my	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
'm	O
nevin	O
from	O
sunnyvale	O
california	O

okay	O

oh	O
i	O
definitely	O
think	O
like	O
decisions	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
unanimous	O

it	O
's	O
probably	O
the	O
safest	O
thing	O

no	O

even	BE_IP
like	C
you	O
know	O
two	O
thirds	O
majority	O

gives	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
much	O
power	O

plus	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
you	O
know	O
doing	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
guilty	O
verdict	O

but	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
you	O
know	O
maybe	O
for	O
technical	O
reasons	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O

yeah	O

it	O
'd	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
of	O
that	O

oh	O

i	O
tend	O
to	O
follow	O
it	O
just	BE
to	IP
just	C
to	C
know	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
about	O
the	O
civil	O
cases	O
when	O
in	O
criminal	O
cases	O
which	O
is	O

it	O
's	O
more	O
in	O
how	O
you	O
presented	O
versus	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

i	O
know	O

that	O
was	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago	O
involved	O
in	O
some	O
pretrial	O
stuff	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
'd	O
go	O
say	O
okay	O
we	O
ca	O
n't	O
bring	O
up	O
this	O
point	O
because	O
then	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
opposition	O
will	O
say	O
this	O
this	O
and	O
this	O

yep	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
that	O
the	O
truth	O
really	O
is	O
an	O
important	O
anymore	O

it	O
sounds	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
abuse	O
of	O
our	O
system	O

part	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
general	O

people	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
responsibility	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
originally	O
chicago	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
either	O
other	O
than	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
sure	O
how	O
we	O
could	O
change	O
the	O
legal	O
system	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
better	O

oh	O
i	O
know	O

and	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
criminal	O
cases	O
where	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
jail	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
room	O
left	O

jim	O
bliss	O
from	O
minneapolis	O
minnesota	O

i	O
guess	O
the	O
topic	O
is	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
and	O
how	O
we	O
should	O
change	O
that	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
how	O
we	O
would	O
change	O

i	O
'm	O
ready	O
whenever	O
you	O
are	O

so	O
what	BE
are	IE
your	IP
what	C
are	C
your	C
thoughts	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
too	O
easy	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
quorum	O
and	O
simple	O
majority	O
wo	O
n't	O
do	O

quorums	O
are	O
too	O
easy	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
always	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
chance	O
at	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
people	O
could	O
be	O
playing	O
devil	O
's	O
advocate	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
reason	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
definitely	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE
could	IP
i	C
could	C
n't	C
believe	O
this	O
suggested	O
that	O
judges	O
should	O
be	O
doing	O
the	O
sentencing	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O
of	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
people	O
at	O
least	O
who	O
would	O
be	O
arguing	O
with	O
them	O
or	O
arguing	O
against	O
that	O
pretty	O
vehemently	O

but	O

about	O
the	O
only	O
good	O
thing	O
i	O
would	O
see	O
about	O
that	O
as	O
i	O
would	O
've	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
her	O
the	O
process	O
up	O
a	O
bit	O
but	O
i	O
mean	O
even	O
now	O
we	BE
've	IE
got	IP
i	C
know	C
we	C
've	C
got	C
plenty	O
of	O
cases	O
out	O
there	O
where	O
people	O
have	O
been	O
wrongly	O
convicted	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O

i	O
mean	O
jeez	O
if	BE
it	IP
if	C
the	C
judge	O
was	O
doing	O
it	O
himself	O
without	O
any	O
checks	O
and	O

who	O
's	O
to	O
say	O

yeah	O

no	O
doubt	O

are	O
you	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O

at	O
all	O

i	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
just	O

but	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O

i	O

with	O
the	O

the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
right	O
now	O

really	O
have	O

because	O
a	O

of	O
those	O

it	BE
's	IE
all	IP
it	C_IE

their	O

better	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
weird	O

oh	O
it	O
's	O
think	O
about	O

because	O

this	BE_IP
this	C
friend	O

mine	O
's	O
pretty	O
obnoxious	O

and	O
he	O
really	O
gets	O
into	O

people	O

and	O
so	O
he	BE
'll	IP
he	C
'll	C
sue	O
just	O
about	O
anybody	O
just	O
for	O
the	O
chance	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
court	O
and	O
argue	O
his	O
case	O
you	O
know	O

it	BE
's	IP
like	C_IE
it	C_IE
's	C_IP
it	C_IE
's	C_IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
waste	O
in	O
people	O
's	O
time	O
and	O
the	O
taxpayers'	O
money	O
and	O
everything	O
else	O

but	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
look	O
into	O
place	O
blame	O
and	O
stuff	O

you	O
're	O
from	O
california	O

right	O

oh	O

it	O
's	O
just	O

i	BE
wonder	IP
i	C
wonder	C
how	BE_IP
how	C
the	O
civil	O
system	O
or	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
court	C
systems	C
differ	O
between	O
there	O
and	O
say	O
where	O
i	O
am	O
in	O
minneapolis	O

from	O
what	O
i	O
understand	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
pretty	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
except	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
louisiana	O

and	O
louisiana	O
is	O
completely	O
different	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
based	O
on	O
that	O

it	O
's	O
based	O
on	O
common	O
law	O

and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
countries	O
not	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

pretty	O
strange	O

but	O
fortunately	O
i	O
never	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
even	BE_IP
even	C
for	C
jury	O
duty	O

but	O
that	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
's	O
telling	O
me	O
that	O
i	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
for	BE_IP
as	C
a	O
witness	O

he	O
may	O
subpoena	O
me	O

so	O
we	O
'll	O
see	O
what	O
happens	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O

there	O
are	O
too	O
many	O
big	O
problems	O

there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
such	O
a	O
backlog	O
of	O
court	O
cases	O
right	O
now	O
you	O
know	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
all	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
a	O
good	O
time	O

and	O
we	O
already	O
have	O
too	O
many	O
lawyers	O
as	O
it	O
is	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

and	O
in	O
fact	O
they	O
're	O
even	O
letting	O
some	O
go	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
originally	O
from	O
florida	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IE
like	IP
it	C
seems	C
like	C
every	O
year	O
they	O
let	O
out	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
just	O
because	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
room	O
for	O
them	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
good	O
solution	O
either	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
sure	O
what	O

no	O

do	O
you	O
have	O
any	O
special	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
now	O

yeah	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
kind	O
of	O
young	O

i	O
'm	O
only	O
twenty	O
two	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
you	O
know	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
that	O
's	O
happened	O
in	O
my	O
lifetime	O
as	O
far	O
as	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
with	C
the	O
space	O
shuttle	O
in	O
all	O
although	O
plans	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
other	O
planets	O
have	O
somewhat	O
been	O
thwarted	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
the	O
sixties	O

although	O
i	O
have	O
a	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
wonder	O
if	BE_IP
some	C
if	C
it	O
were	O
possible	O
to	O
market	O
some	O
form	O
of	O
space	O
technology	O
you	O
know	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
make	O
it	O
equitable	O
it	O
might	O
severely	O
help	O
the	O
economy	O
you	O
know	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
respect	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
endless	O
amounts	O
of	O
research	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
endless	O
amounts	O
of	O
resources	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
whatnot	O

it	O
'd	O
be	O
great	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
we	O
could	O
find	O
some	O
way	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
use	O
that	O
to	O
boost	O
the	O
economy	O

exactly	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
positive	O
side	O
effects	O
then	O

i	O
understand	O

sure	O

that	O
makes	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
sense	O

yeah	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

now	O
we	O
're	O
done	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
right	O

i	O
would	O
too	O

and	O

john	O
denver	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
try	O
to	O
buy	O
his	O
way	O
under	O
the	O
space	O

oh	O
yeah	O

ever	O
since	O
i	O
was	O
young	O
and	O
used	O
to	O
watch	O
the	O
old	O
apollo	O
missions	O
going	O
off	O
in	O
the	O
classroom	O
t	O
v's	O

i	O
suspect	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
got	BE_IP
turned	C
on	O
by	O
watching	O
watching	O
those	O
go	O
off	O

very	O
exciting	O

the	O

i	BE
have	IP
i	C
've	C
always	O
wanted	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
somehow	O
involved	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
and	BE_IP
to	C
me	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
to	O
see	O
see	O
it	O
actually	O
happen	O

course	O
i	O
've	O
really	O
wanted	O
taxi	O
managed	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
space	O
someday	O

but	O
that	O
seems	O
rather	O
unlikely	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
unfortunately	O

computer	O
programmer	O

unfortunately	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
done	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O

yeah	O

and	O
made	O
the	O
wrong	BE_IP
wrong	C
career	O
choice	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
into	O
space	O

the	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
think	O
when	BE
i	IE
was	IP
when	C
i	C
was	C
younger	O
that	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
'd	O
have	O
lots	O
more	O
stuff	O
and	O
face	O
than	O
we	O
do	O
now	O

frustrating	O
at	O
times	O

i	O
know	O
what	O
you	O
think	O
about	O

yeah	O

well	O
the	O

i	O
've	O
always	O
felt	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
term	O
solutions	O
to	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
our	O
problems	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
solar	O
power	O
satellites	O
up	O

because	O
that	O
's	O
a	BE_IP
you	O
know	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
singularly	O
renewable	O
resource	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
require	O
any	O
particularly	O
nasty	O
environmental	O
impact	O

and	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
get	O
as	O
much	O
power	O
as	O
you	O
need	O
up	O
there	O

as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
how	O
big	O
you	O
build	O
it	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
have	O
lunar	O
mining	O
bases	O
in	O
space	O
stations	O
and	O
easy	O
transport	O
into	O
space	O
and	O
north	O
of	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
doing	O

so	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
of	O
doing	O
that	O
which	O
i	O
think	O
would	O
be	O
good	O
and	O
very	BE_IP
very	C
good	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
everyone	O
in	O
the	O
long	O
run	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
it	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
things	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
happen	O
would	O
happen	O
also	O

so	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

the	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
of	O
course	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
requires	O
significant	O
commitment	O
from	O
people	O
too	O
actually	O
decide	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
put	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
up	O
there	O

they	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
research	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
all	O
you	O
know	O

do	O
any	O
commitments	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
interested	O
in	O
making	O
or	O
even	O
talking	O
about	O
are	O
ones	O
for	O
flash	O
value	O
like	O
the	O
trip	O
to	O
mars	O
which	O
is	BE_IP
would	C_IP
would	C
produce	O
some	O
useful	O
scientific	O
research	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O

but	O
the	O
same	O
money	O
could	O
probably	O
be	O
far	O
better	O
spent	O
on	O
lunar	O
bases	O
and	O
solar	O
power	O
satellite	O
research	O
and	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
and	C
so	O
forth	O

it	BE_IP
it	C_IE
would	IE
be	IP
it	C
would	C
be	C
being	O
done	O
for	O
the	O
glitz	O
and	O
show	O
factor	O
to	O
get	O
politicians	O
votes	O
instead	BE
of	IP
instead	C
of	C
for	O

we	O
should	O
eventually	O
send	O
someone	O
at	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
mars	O
but	O
not	O
just	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
glitzy	O
to	O
do	O
so	O

she	O
would	O
do	O
it	O
because	O
for	BE
the	IP
for	C
the	C
return	O
we	O
get	O
for	O
it	O

and	O
unfortunately	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
why	O
things	O
happen	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
would	O
settle	O
for	BE
the	IP
for	C_IE
the	C_IE
glitz	C_IP
if	C
the	C
side	C
effects	C
were	O
useful	O
like	O
the	O

but	O
the	O
downside	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
you	BE_IP
after	C
you	C
do	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
say	O
well	O
we	O
did	O
it	O

no	BE_IP
no	C
we	O
're	O
done	O

do	O
this	O
anymore	O
to	O
play	O
around	O
with	O
this	O
space	O
stuff	O
anymore	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
happened	O
with	O
apollo	O

but	O
i	O
'd	O
give	O
almost	O
anything	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
space	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
situation	O
yet	O

you	O
know	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
parents	O
are	O
not	O
quite	O
at	O
that	O
age	O
yet	O

so	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O

so	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
been	O
in	O
that	O
situation	O
although	O
they	O
are	O
thinking	O
about	O
my	O
grandmother	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
really	O
about	O
it	O

how	O
about	O
you	O

have	O
you	O
been	O
in	O
that	O
situation	O

uh-huh	O

did	O
it	O
really	O

oh	O

that	O
's	O
sad	O

yeah	O

oh	O
okay	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
they	O
were	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

oh	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
expensive	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

my	BE_IP
my	C
grandmother	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

but	O
she	BE
's	IE
in	IP
oh	C_IE
they	C_IE
're	C_IP
like	C
they	C
're	C
apartments	O
for	O
senior	O
citizens	O
and	O
she	O
loves	O
that	O
because	O
they	O
arrange	O
activities	O
for	O
them	O
all	O
day	O
long	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
have	O
where	O
the	O
bus	O
picks	O
them	O
up	O
and	O
takes	O
them	O
where	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
go	O

and	O
she	BE_IP
she	C_IP
she	C
really	O
does	O

but	O
she	O
's	O
just	O
concerned	O
about	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
future	O
you	O
know	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
knows	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

she	O
's	O
just	O
wonderful	O
what	O
's	O
gonna	BE_IP
happen	C
to	O
me	O

and	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
so	O
normal	O
took	O
start	O
to	O
wonder	O
about	O
that	O
even	O
though	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
need	O
that	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
she	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
asking	O
questions	O
about	O
why	O
well	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O

ca	O
n't	O
last	O
forever	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

she	O
can	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
it	O
's	O
also	O
cafeteria	O
style	O

because	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
really	C_IP
i	C_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
doubt	O
if	O
she	O
rarely	O
cooks	O
for	O
herself	O

so	BE_IP
because	C
i	BE_IP
i	C
remember	O
her	O
in	O
her	O
letters	O
telling	O
me	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
'll	C
go	O
downstairs	O
for	O
coffee	O
or	O
something	O
to	O
eat	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
assuming	O
it	O
's	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
too	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

and	O
she	O
lives	O
by	O
herself	O
too	O

seems	O
to	O
like	O
it	O

and	O
my	O
husband	O
's	O
grandmother	O
is	O

she	BE
lives	IP
she	C
lives	C
in	O
a	O
house	O
on	O
her	O

and	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
need	O
the	O
care	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
she	O
has	O
her	O
own	O
home	O

and	O
she	O
's	O
doing	O
really	O
well	O

really	O
proud	O
of	O
her	O

she	O
's	O
doing	O
really	O
well	O

so	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
she	O
has	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
support	O

so	O
i	O
mean	O
she	O
's	O
got	O
her	O
mother	O
in	O
town	O
too	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
hopefully	O
we	O
wo	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
go	O
that	O
route	O

yeah	O

not	O
quite	O
elderly	O

not	O
for	O
my	O
parents	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
was	O
around	O
two	O
sets	O
of	O
grandparents	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

we	O
put	O
one	O
i	O
put	O
one	O
grandfather	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O
and	O
that	O
killed	O
him	O

yeah	O

well	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
other	O
things	O
involved	O

but	O

before	O
he	O
was	O
really	O
active	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
there	C
were	O
some	O

lost	O
his	O
drivers	O
license	O

could	O
n't	O
get	O
around	O
and	O
was	O
n't	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
things	O

so	O
we	O
ended	O
up	O
just	O
having	O
to	O
put	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O

and	O
he	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
became	O
a	O
vegetable	O
and	O
died	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
that	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
ago	O

that	O
was	O
back	O
in	O
seventy	O

so	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
way	O
they	O
did	O
things	O
were	O
a	O
lot	O
different	O
back	O
then	O

and	O
my	O
grandmother	O
his	BE_IP
his	C
wife	O
we	O
also	O
put	O
her	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O

she	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O

she	O
was	O
back	O
out	O
because	O
she	O
did	O
n't	O
really	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
there	O

and	O
had	BE
a	IE
physical	IP
had	C
a	C
good	C
physical	O

and	O
they	O

her	O
walking	O
and	O
got	O
her	O
take	O
kind	O

so	O
she	O
was	O

and	O
then	O
she	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
in	O
a	O

but	O
mostly	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
because	O
she	O
kind	O
of	O
gave	O
up	O

and	O
they	O
got	O
her	O
going	O
again	O

i	O
guess	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
looking	O
and	O
i	O
said	O
the	BE_IP
as	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
looking	O
for	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
an	BE

our	C
interactive	C
staff	O
somebody	O
who	O
's	O
willing	O

with	O
you	O

with	O
the	O
patience	O
and	O
do	BE_IP
do	C
things	O
with	O
them	O
and	O
treat	O
them	O
treat	O
them	O
like	O
that	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
is	O

it	O
is	O
expensive	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

when	O
she	O
ca	O
n't	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
herself	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

does	O
she	O
have	O

is	O
it	O
like	O
a	O
kitchenette	O
type	O

where	O
she	O
can	O
fix	O
her	O
own	O
foot	O
if	O
she	O

it	O
can	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
the	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
really	O
liked	O
that	O
concept	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
have	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
those	BE_IP
quite	C
a	C
few	O
of	O
those	O
places	O
like	O
that	O
here	O
in	O
utah	O

you	O

couples	O
can	O
you	O
know	O

husband	O

can	BE_IP
can	C
live	O
there	O
too	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
whatever	O

and	BE

that	O
you	O

of	O
getting	O
together	O
and	O
eating	O
together	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
really	O
takes	O
you	O
know	O
looking	O
more	O
at	O
the	O
people	O
than	O
even	O
really	O
the	O
facility	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
thing	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
scary	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
tough	O
about	O
putting	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
rest	O
home	O
is	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
almost	O
like	O
that	O

putting	O
them	O
out	O
to	O
pasture	O

and	O
some	BE_IP
some	C
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
were	O
there	O
with	O
my	O
grandmother	O
were	O
really	O
active	O

hey	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
things	O

they	BE
did	IE
n't	IP
you	C
know	C
they	C
did	C
n't	C
want	O
to	O
go	O
down	O
and	O
play	O
bingo	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
play	O
with	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
capital	O
punishment	O

yeah	O

which	O
crimes	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
that	O

yeah	O

so	O
many	O
times	O
that	O
so	O
brutal	O
and	O
just	O
recurrent	O
felons	O
i	O
things	O
should	O
also	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

go	O
ahead	O

texas	O
is	O
too	O

texas	O
i	O

on	O
t	O
v	O
the	O
other	O
night	O
is	BE
the	IP
has	C
had	C
forty	O
six	O
and	O
like	O
the	O
past	O
several	O
years	O

so	O
they	O
're	O
pretty	BE_IP
hip	C
on	O
it	O
too	O
i	O
guess	O

they	O
do	O
it	O
by	O
lethal	O
injection	O
at	O
huntsville	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
's	O
happening	O
care	O

like	O

in	O
fact	O
of	O
big	O
gubernatorial	O
issue	O
is	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
turnover	O
rates	O
of	O
repeat	O

being	O
let	O
out	O
and	O
doing	O
it	O
again	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	BE
was	IE
just	IP
if	C
they	C
were	C
gonna	C
do	C
it	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
because	O

and	O
dealing	O
with	O
who	O
gets	O
lethal	O

and	O
who	O
does	O
n't	O
it	O

a	O
little	O
more	O
you	O

not	O
being	O
able	O

it	O
off	O
for	O
fifteen	O
years	O

oh	O
really	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
i	O
tend	O
to	O
think	O
the	O
repeal	O
system	O
for	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
is	O
a	O
little	BE_IP
little	C
too	O
lenient	O

kind	O
of	O
takes	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
significance	O
of	O
the	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
graduate	O

texas	O
at	O

audiology	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O

oh	O
really	O

oh	O
really	O

yeah	O

i	O
just	O

this	O
was	O
in	O

with	O
the	O
guy	O
that	O
was	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
gas	O
chamber	O
in	O
california	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
it	O

the	O
forty	O
six	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
twenty	O
five	O
years	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
what	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O
rundown	O
but	O
texas	O
texas	O
tends	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
robust	O
and	O
disciplined	O
area	O

yeah	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
do	O
n't	O
get	O
repealed	O
as	O
easily	O
as	O
they	O
do	O

like	O
the	O
guy	O
in	O
california	O
got	O
thirty	O
you	O
know	O
twice	O
before	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
gas	O
chamber	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
said	O
okay	O
now	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
go	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
took	O
him	O
back	O

and	O
it	BE
just	IE
seems	IP
yeah	C
it	C
just	C
seemed	C
a	O
little	O
inconsistent	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
have	O
like	O

you	O
have	O
these	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
serial	O
killers	O
that	O
did	O
n't	O
even	O
get	O
the	O
death	O
sentence	O
back	O
when	O
ever	O
you	O
know	O

no	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	O
military	O
does	O
n't	O
execute	O
anymore	O

so	O

death	O
before	O
the	O
firing	O
squad	O
or	O
whatever	O

so	O
i	O
think	O
about	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
is	O
rape	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
kind	O
of	O
in	O

of	O
it	O
for	O
certain	O
crimes	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
first	O
degree	O
murder	O
probably	O
warrants	O
it	O

right	O

exactly	O

print	O
crimes	O
like	O
serial	O
rapists	O
or	O
serial	O
murderers	O
or	O
whatever	O

i	O
come	O
from	O
a	O
state	O
that	O
has	O
well	O
i	O
originally	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
state	O
that	O
has	O
the	O
death	O

i	O
come	O
from	O
florida	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
pretty	O
liberal	O
on	O
it	O

they	O

people	O
left	O

right	O
which	O

go	O
ahead	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

okay	O

on	O
the	O

something	O

they	O

if	O
you	O

you	O

a	O

when	O

you	O

they	O
did	O

that	O
or	O
else	O
they	O
would	O
have	O

something	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
they	O
screen	O
for	O
just	O
a	O
particular	O
few	O
types	O

although	O
the	O
literature	O
they	O
give	O
with	O
huge	O
says	O
yeah	O
we	O
do	O
this	O

and	O
their	O
list	O
about	O
five	O
thousand	O
drugs	O
they	O
trying	O
to	O
test	O
for	O

but	O
what	O
programming	O
you	O
went	O
over	O
at	O
carnegie	O
mellon	O

oh	O
okay	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
graduate	O
student	O
at	O
u	O
c	O
f	O
in	O
florida	O
university	O
of	O
central	O
florida	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
actually	O
internship	O
up	O
here	O

but	O
they	BE_IP
even	IE
for	IE
interns	IE
they	C_IP
they	C
do	O
the	O
whole	O
random	O
drug	O
or	O
the	O
whole	O
drug	O
testing	O
thing	O

they	O
essentially	O

essentially	O
they	O
essentially	O
maybe	O
the	O
offer	O
and	BE
then	IP
and	C
then	C
did	O
the	O
drug	O
testing	O
thing	O
after	O
that	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
where	O
you	O
go	O
through	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
general	O
battery	O
of	O
all	O
their	O
tests	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
essentially	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
offer	O
and	O
then	O
at	O
that	O
point	O
they	BE
'll	IP
they	C
'll	C
ask	O
you	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
drug	O
testing	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
some	O
noise	O
on	O
this	O
end	O

i	O
'm	O
actually	O
in	O
a	O
mall	O
calling	O

so	O

you	O
probably	O
wondered	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
question	O

i	O
believe	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
remember	O
of	O
the	O
literature	O
they	O
gave	O
if	O
you	O
fail	O
i	O
believe	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
one	O
more	O
chance	O

they	O
probably	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
explain	O
yourself	O
and	O
then	O
maybe	O
give	O
you	O
another	O
chance	O
to	O
go	O
through	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
once	O
again	O
those	O
things	O
are	O
not	O
that	O
accurate	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
undoubtedly	O
a	O
proportion	O
of	O
people	O
who	O
do	O
fail	O

but	O

are	O
you	O
working	O
right	O
now	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

the	O
first	O
time	O
i	O
'd	O
ever	O
gotten	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
drug	O
screening	O
you	O
know	O
was	BE_IP
was	C
going	O
to	O
honeywell	O

a	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
doctoral	O
student	O
down	O
there	O

and	O
he	O
is	O
doing	O
an	O
internship	O
with	O
i	O
b	O
m	O

and	O
they	O
basically	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
exact	O
thing	O

we	O
both	O
got	O
our	O
internships	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

and	O
we	O
both	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
drug	O
tresting	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
where	O
we	O
went	O
through	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
identical	O
process	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
thing	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
drug	O
testing	O
while	O
you	O
're	O
on	O
the	O
job	O

i	BE
think	IP
i	C
think	C
the	O
unwritten	O
rule	O
is	O
yeah	O
expect	O
it	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
i	O
guess	O

i	O
mean	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
have	O
gone	O
to	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
parties	O
since	BE_IP
since	C
that	O
time	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
any	O
drugs	O
myself	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O
some	O
people	O
who	O
work	O
there	O
you	O
know	O
smoking	O
to	O
join	O
or	O
whatever	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
that	O
would	O
definitely	O
come	O
up	O
you	O
know	O

but	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
see	O
any	O
problem	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
testing	O
for	O
random	O
drugs	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
graduate	O
student	O
right	O
now	O
at	O
carnegie	O
mellon	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
just	O
came	O
from	O
saint	O
paul	O
interviewing	O
the	O
three	O
m	O

and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
policy	O
for	O
testing	O

if	BE
you	IP
if	C
they	C
make	O
you	O
and	O
offer	O
then	O
they	O
'll	O
test	O
you	O
right	O
before	O
you	O
start	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
only	O
drawback	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
drug	O
testing	O
is	O
in	O
case	O
you	O
are	O
on	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
medication	O
that	O
might	O
give	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
false	O
positive	O
result	O
then	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
problem	O

but	O

yeah	O

electrical	O
engineering	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
they	O
test	O
you	O
before	BE
they	IP
before	C
you	C
start	O
or	O
before	O
you	O
even	O
interview	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

what	O
happens	O
if	O
you	O
were	O
to	O
fail	O

do	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
like	O
one	BE_IP
one	C
more	O
chance	O
or	O
two	O
more	O
chances	O

no	O

i	O
'm	O
just	O
about	O
to	O
finish	O
my	O
masters	O
in	O
may	O
and	O
just	O
interviewing	O
with	O
companies	O
right	O
now	O

do	O
they	O
test	O
you	O
right	O
now	O
at	O
work	O
too	O

yeah	O

is	O
it	O
formal	O
policy	O
that	O
they	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
test	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
have	O
not	O
even	O
heard	O
believe	O
it	O
or	O
not	O
all	O
that	O
person	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O

when	O
you	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
surprise	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
mainly	O
because	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O

what	O

politically	O
going	O
on	O
in	BE
that	IP
you	C

in	C

as	O
far	O
as	O

now	O
the	O

that	O

that	O
i	O

it	C

it	O

have	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
so	O
many	O
different	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
house	O
the	O
congress	O
and	O
all	BE
of	IE
the	IP
of	C
other	O
things	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
bill	O
passed	O

and	O
sure	O
you	O
can	O
veto	BE_IP
veto	C
it	O
at	O
the	O
last	O
minute	O

but	O
then	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
like	O
you	O
have	O
all	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
long	O
time	O
ago	O
presidents	O
did	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
power	O
and	O

so	O
interesting	O
political	O
trends	O
or	O
events	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
one	O
that	O
going	O
on	O
right	O
now	O
from	O
my	O
perspective	O
is	O
this	O
phenomena	O
of	O
ross	O
perot	O

caught	O
his	O
interview	O
last	O
night	O
with	O
david	O
frost	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
first	O
time	O
i	O
had	O
you	O
know	O
heard	O
you	O
know	O
his	O
views	O
expressed	O
by	O
himself	O

i	O
'd	O
heard	O
other	O
people	O
talk	O
about	O
what	O
they	O
thought	O
he	O
believed	O
in	O

but	O
the	O
whole	O
phenomena	O
of	O
him	O
coming	O
out	O
of	O
literally	O
nowhere	O
no	O
party	O
at	O
least	O
no	O
apparent	O
party	O
support	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
is	O
pretty	O
interesting	O

um-hum	O

like	O
out	O
of	O
nowhere	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

well	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
the	O
decisions	O
so	O
far	O
has	O
been	O
filtered	O
by	O
you	O
know	O
party	O
politics	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
candidates	O
finally	O
get	O
party	O
approval	O
party	O
support	O
and	O
therefore	O
get	O
presented	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
candidates	O
are	O
already	O
beyond	O
what	O
most	O
public	O
feels	O
is	O
acceptable	O
behavior	O

you	O
know	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
criticisms	O
of	O
clinton	O
as	O
gee	O
he	O
'll	O
say	O
or	O
do	O
anything	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
white	O
house	O

and	O
up	O
until	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
perot	O
being	O
a	O
serious	O
candidate	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
was	O
a	O
requirement	O
of	O
being	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
contender	O
within	O
the	O
party	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
to	O
have	O
done	O
all	O
those	O
things	O

i	O
mean	O
here	BE
's	IE
a	IP
here	C
's	C
a	C
guy	O
who	O
for	O
twenty	O
years	O
has	O
been	O
working	BE
toward	IP
you	C
know	C
getting	C
the	O
party	O
nomination	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
preparing	O
himself	O
for	O
the	O
presidency	O

and	O
now	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
both	O
he	O
in	O
the	O
incumbent	O
president	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
pretty	O
seriously	O
threatened	O
by	O
somebody	O
who	O
comes	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
whole	O
nonpolitical	O
arena	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

and	O
yet	O
even	O
he	O
was	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
consummate	O
politician	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
not	O
only	O
did	O
he	O
fill	O
in	O
business	O
twice	O
with	O
bankruptcy	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
failure	O
but	O
he	O
lost	O
some	O
eighteen	O
elections	O
before	O
he	O
finally	O
won	O
one	O

and	O
the	O
first	O
first	O
and	O
only	O
election	O
he	O
one	O
was	O
the	O
presidency	O

he	O
had	O
lost	O
every	O
other	O
office	O
that	O
he	O
had	O

he	O
was	O
appointed	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O
too	O
i	O
like	O
state	O
legislator	O

yeah	O

and	O
then	O
when	O
he	O
finally	O
you	O
know	O
did	O
win	O
that	O
election	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
presidency	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

but	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

let	O
me	O
see	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
sitting	O
here	O

i	O
almost	O
forgot	O
the	O
topic	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
i	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
news	O
from	O
television	O

we	O
only	O
get	O
the	O
paper	O
on	O
the	O
weekend	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
much	O
of	BE
a	IP
of	C
a	C
paper	O
reader	O

but	BE
i	IP
i	C_IP
and	C
i	C
'm	C
do	O
n't	O
really	O
listen	O
to	O
the	O
radio	O

uh-huh	O

are	O
you	O
in	O
the	O
car	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

oh	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
i	O
see	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
pretty	O
much	O

i	O
watch	O
the	O
news	O
at	O
least	O
twice	O
a	O
day	O

so	O
if	O
i	O
've	O
missed	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
've	O
just	O
recently	O
decided	O
stay	O
home	O
with	O
my	O
children	O

so	O
it	O
seems	O
as	O
if	O
i	O
catch	O
the	O
news	O
rise	O
right	O
at	O
as	O
it	O
happens	O

that	O
was	O
the	O
explosions	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

well	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
about	O

and	O
i	O
said	O
yes	O

but	O
at	O
such	O
and	O
such	O

so	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
different	O
for	O
me	O

and	O
usually	O
find	O
out	O
what	O
exactly	O
when	O
it	O
happens	O
in	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O

oh	O
no	O

it	O
just	O
seems	O
like	O
since	O
i	O
've	O
recently	O
stayed	O
home	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
's	O
happened	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
that	BE_IP
now	C
that	C
i	O
've	O
stayed	O
home	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
usually	O
aware	O
of	O
when	O
these	O
things	O
have	O
occurred	O
and	O
it	O
happened	O
and	O

right	O

kind	O
of	O
gives	O
you	O
the	O
whole	O
story	O
or	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
story	O

that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
saying	O

yeah	O

but	O
i	O
try	O
and	O
catch	O
most	O
of	O
those	O
programs	O
on	O
wednesdays	O
and	O
fridays	O

and	O
if	O
i	O
miss	O
them	O
i	BE
try	IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
try	C
and	BE_IP
and	C
take	O
them	O
out	O
or	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

and	O
tape	O
them	O

so	O
i	O
can	O
sit	O
back	O
and	O
watch	O
it	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
pretty	O
interesting	O

um-hum	O
um-hum	O

well	O
yeah	O

plus	O
i	O
find	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
videotape	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
thing	O

if	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
any	O
interruptions	O
yeah	O

that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
at	O
night	O

unfortunately	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
what	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
at	O
night	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
get	O
a	O
weekend	O
paper	O
as	O
well	O

and	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
that	O
i	O
get	O
a	O
local	O
weekly	O

i	O
live	O
in	O
a	O
suburb	O
of	O
milwaukee	O
and	O
they	BE
get	IP
they	C
have	C
community	O
newspapers	O
around	O
here	O

so	O
the	BE
local	IP
their	C
extremely	C
local	O
stuff	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
local	O
paper	O
that	O
comes	O
out	O
once	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
get	O
the	O
sunday	O
milwaukee	O
journal	O
because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
read	O
a	O
paper	O

mostly	O
that	O
's	O
my	O
difficulty	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
get	O
my	O
news	O
pretty	O
much	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
sources	O
you	O
do	O
although	O
i	O
do	O
listen	O
to	O
n	BE_IP
p	C_IP
r	C
which	O
has	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
that	O
's	O
national	O
public	O
radio	O
which	O
has	O
very	O
good	O
coverage	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
an	O
international	O
news	O
i	O
feel	O
and	O
does	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
job	O
of	O
analysis	O
as	O
well	O

usually	O
no	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
actually	O

but	O
i	O
can	O
run	O
my	O
radio	O
in	O
my	O
office	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
teach	O
at	O
the	O
university	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
teaching	O
if	O
i	O
choose	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
radio	O
and	O
i	O
can	O
listen	O
to	O
that	O
station	O

so	O

how	O
are	BE
you	IP
are	C
you	C
satisfied	O
with	O
twenty	O
twenty	O
and	O
forty	O
eight	O
hours	O
and	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
watch	O

uh-huh	O

is	O
that	O
the	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
news	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
most	O
interested	O
in	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
the	O
timely	O
in	O
noting	O
of	O
the	O
events	O
as	O
they	O
happen	O

is	O
that	O
what	O
you	O
feel	O
good	O
about	O
in	O
the	O
news	O
coverage	O

well	O
i	BE
myself	IP
the	C
reason	C
why	C
i	C
listen	O
to	O
n	O
p	O
r	O
and	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
i	O
watch	O
macneil	O
lehrer	O
rather	O
than	BE
the	IP
than	C
the	C
network	O
news	O
shows	O
at	O
night	O
although	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
watch	O
a	O
local	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
news	O
which	O
you	O
know	O
carries	O
over	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
news	O
stories	O
is	O
that	O
quite	O
often	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
national	O
does	O
n't	O
do	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
job	O
of	O
analysis	O

the	O
local	O
does	O
n't	O
either	O

but	O
i	O
feel	O
that	O
mcneil	O
lehrer	O
get	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
deeply	O
into	O
some	BE_IP
some	C
of	O
the	O
issues	O
that	O
are	O
really	O
current	O

perhaps	O
newspapers	O
do	O
that	O

but	O
as	O
i	O
said	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
read	O
a	O
newspaper	O

and	O
frankly	O
when	O
i	O
have	O
read	O
a	O
newspaper	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
noticed	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
analysis	O
either	O

so	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
some	O
danger	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
course	O
too	O

because	O
if	O
the	O
analysis	O
is	O
inaccurate	O
or	O
biased	O
or	O
whatever	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
how	O
good	O
is	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
indepth	O
coverage	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
maybe	O
appealing	O
to	O
you	O
too	O
on	O
something	O
like	O
twenty	O
twenty	O
or	O
forty	O
eight	O
hours	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
more	O
interested	O
in	O
trying	O
to	O
understand	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
rather	O
than	O
simply	O
being	O
aware	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
that	O
an	O
event	O
has	O
occurred	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
like	O
to	O
stand	O
back	O
and	O
get	O
a	O
slightly	O
bigger	O
picture	O

maybe	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
easily	O
confused	O
by	O
detail	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

so	O

you	O
have	O
young	O
children	O
right	O

so	O
those	O
evening	O
shows	O
are	O
probably	O
also	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
at	O
liberty	O
to	O
take	O
some	O
time	O
off	O
and	O
be	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
t	O
v	O
set	O
for	O
awhile	O
without	O
interruption	O

oh	O
you	O
do	O

when	O
is	O
your	O
good	O
watching	O
time	O

yes	O

i	O
have	O
older	O
children	O
and	O
getting	O
dinner	O
on	O
the	O
table	O

i	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
east	O
coast	O

and	O
it	O
was	O

it	O
amazed	O
me	O
when	O
i	O
got	O
out	O
here	O
to	O
the	O
midwest	O
and	O
found	O
out	O
that	O
even	O
though	O
they	O
're	O
an	O
hour	O
earlier	O
in	O
time	O
they	O
still	O
watch	O
the	O
news	O
when	O
new	O

oh	O
you	O
're	O
kidding	O

um-hum	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
because	O
sometimes	O
i	O
wonder	O
you	O
know	O
being	O
a	O
lay	O
person	O
out	O
there	O
of	O
not	O
knowing	O
exactly	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
space	O
whether	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
ahead	O
and	O
doing	O
things	O
and	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
we	O
're	O
spending	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
the	O
programs	O
and	O
not	O
spending	O
enough	O
money	O
on	O
the	O
earth	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
here	O

being	O
you	O
know	O

to	O
me	O
all	O
this	O
space	O
exploration	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
done	O
thus	O
far	O
has	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
other	O
place	O
like	O
or	O
that	O
we	O
ca	O
n't	O
live	O
on	O
mars	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
live	O
here	O
we	O
ca	O
n't	O
live	O
there	O

i	O
mean	O
this	O
is	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
place	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
live	O

i	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
other	O
resource	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
other	O
than	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
to	O
me	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
money	O
being	O
put	O
toward	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
environment	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
here	O
and	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
emphasis	O
put	O
on	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
out	O
in	O
space	O
and	O
what	O
you	O
know	O

not	O
that	O
i	O
want	O
everything	O
to	O
halt	O

let	O
's	O
forget	O
about	O
the	O
space	O
program	O
or	O
whatever	O

because	O
we	O
're	O
always	O
curious	O

and	O
we	O
always	O
need	O
to	O
know	O
more	O
things	O

but	O
to	O
me	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
let	O
's	O
try	O
and	O
clean	O
up	O
the	O
air	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
here	O

you	O

i	O

how	O
you	O

somebody	O

well	O
a	O

actually	O
works	O
for	O
mcdonald	O
douglas	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C

so	O
i	O
get	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
information	O
about	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
there	O

sure	O
sounds	O
like	O
that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
really	O
viable	O
program	O
at	O
that	O
continues	O
to	O
be	O

at	O
current	O
levels	O

they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
going	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
interesting	O
things	O

i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
big	O
things	O
that	O
he	O
's	O
involved	O
with	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
the	O
micro	O
gravity	O
payloads	O

and	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
direct	O
impact	O
on	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
really	O
ca	O
n't	O
do	O
down	O
here	O
on	O
earth	O
including	O
some	O
new	O
pharmaceutical	O
techniques	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
a	BE_IP
a	C
big	O
opportunity	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
explore	O
what	O
sorts	O
of	O
things	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
in	O
a	O
zero	O
gravity	O
environment	O

so	O
i	O
suspect	O
that	O
will	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
gains	O
from	O
that	O

oh	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
practical	O
aspects	O
go	O
i	O
suspect	O
that	O
the	O
space	O
station	O
may	O
actually	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
compromise	O
between	O
you	O
know	O
deep	O
splace	O
i	O
'm	O
sorry	O
deep	O
space	O
exploration	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
not	O
doing	O
anything	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
off	O
load	O
some	O
things	O
to	O
the	O
space	O
station	O

and	O
no	O
perhaps	O
we	O
can	O
find	O
better	O
techniques	O
for	O
doing	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
normally	O
do	O
down	O
here	O
that	O
are	O

to	O
the	O

how	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
the	O
public	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

well	O
that	O
's	O

i	O

a	O

a	O

right	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O

what	O

a	O

the	O

just	O
terrible	O

wow	O

that	O
is	O
slow	O

um-hum	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
is	O
wrong	O
because	O
then	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
one	O
thing	O
i	O
worry	O
about	O

yeah	O

quite	O
a	O
few	O
black	O
people	O
up	O
there	O

and	O

oh	O
is	O
that	O
right	O

oh	O
okay	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C

you	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
seem	O
racist	O
or	O

or	O
whatever	O

but	O
then	O
again	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

that	O
did	O
that	O

sure	O
you	O
know	O

teachers	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
admit	O
the	O
teachers	O

to	O

for	O
people	O
who	O

the	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
consider	O

very	O
very	O
lucky	O

we	O

a	O

probably	O
about	O

your	O

twenty	O

our	O

a	O

that	O
you	O

it	O
would	O
be	O

the	O

my	O

i	BE_IP

and	O
you	O

it	BE_IP

right	O

over	O

they	O

that	O

if	O

they	O

the	O

what	O

and	O
i	BE_IP

it	O

that	O

right	O

so	BE_IP
so	C
that	O
's	O

it	BE
would	IE

it	C

be	C
really	O

if	O
they	O

and	O
they	BE
just	IP
we	C

about	O
a	O

about	O
that	O

but	O
it	O
did	O
n't	O
go	O

right	O

i	O
guess	O
what	BE
they	IP
what	C
they	C
were	O

about	O
here	O
was	BE_IP
was	C
reducing	O
the	O
garbage	O

in	O
order	O
to	O
make	O
that	O
up	O
or	O
something	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
option	O

i	O
guess	O
one	O
thing	O
they	O
're	O
working	O
on	O
now	O
is	O
recycling	O
plastics	O
too	O

have	O
you	O
noticed	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
plastic	O
goods	O
they	O
have	O
this	O
little	O
number	O
now	O
the	O
tells	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
plastic	O
it	O
is	O

i	O
guess	O
the	O
problem	O
with	O
plastic	O
is	O
there	O
's	O
so	O
many	O
different	O
kinds	O
that	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
recycle	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
just	O
throw	O
all	O
plastic	O
into	O
one	O
recycler	O

so	O
now	O
they	O
're	O
like	O
marking	O

yeah	O

there	O
's	O
six	O
seven	O
eight	O
different	O
kind	O
of	O
plastics	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
mark	O
on	O
the	O
bottom	O
what	O
kind	O
it	O
is	O

but	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
makes	O
it	O
easy	O
to	O
recycle	O

and	O
then	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
trying	O
to	O
make	O
plastic	O
goods	O
that	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
different	O
plastics	O
in	O
them	O
you	O
know	O
that	BE
are	IP
that	C
are	C
only	O
made	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
kind	O
of	O
plastic	O

so	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
makes	O
it	O
easier	O
i	O
guess	O

does	O
your	O
friend	O
go	O
to	O
recycle	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
it	O
gets	O
passed	O
on	O
you	O
know	O
one	BE_IP
one	C
person	O
you	O
hear	O
it	O
from	O
another	O
person	O

and	O
then	BE
you	IP
then	C
you	C
pass	O
it	O
on	O

yeah	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
catching	O
on	O
slowly	O
but	O
surely	O
i	O
guess	O

that	O
's	O
neat	O

that	O
's	O
neat	O

well	O
when	O
you	O
start	O
early	O

go	O

where	O
it	BE_IP
we	C
have	O
to	O
keep	O

keep	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
we	O
have	O
and	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
scary	O
though	O
about	O
you	O

hi	O
are	O
the	O

when	O
my	O

you	O

that	BE_IP
that	C_IE

that	C
's	C

not	O
anything	O

it	O
was	O
mine	O

so	O
you	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
the	O

that	O
you	O

you	O

that	O

something	O

oh	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O

and	O
it	O
seems	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
rarely	O

you	O

it	BE

you	O

at	O

here	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
something	O
that	O
needs	O
to	O
stay	O

yeah	O

my	O
sister	O
and	O
i	O
were	O
wondering	O
about	O
this	O
recently	O
because	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
friend	O
of	O
ours	O
in	O
california	O
this	BE_IP
this	C
happened	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
her	O
husband	O
just	O
killed	O
her	O

and	O
we	O
're	O
wondering	O
if	O
that	O
has	O
an	O
effect	O
if	BE
that	IP
if	C
something	O

does	O
capital	O
punishment	O
you	O
know	O
does	O
n't	O
happen	O
with	O
that	O
within	O
that	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
right	O

um-hum	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
an	O
uncle	O
that	O
is	O
an	O
attorney	O
that	O
defends	O
people	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
publicity	O
it	O
's	O
gotten	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
state	O

but	O
california	O
we	O
just	O
put	O
somebody	O
to	O
death	O
for	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
double	O
murder	O

to	BE
be	IE
honest	IP
i	C
did	C
n't	C
pay	C
that	O
much	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
details	O
of	O
it	O

but	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
controversy	O
out	BE_IP
here	C
basically	O
because	O
in	O
california	O
people	O
like	O
to	O
protest	O
about	O
everything	O

but	O
i	O
agree	O

i	O
believe	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
there	O
are	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
crimes	O
that	O
capital	O
punishment	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
go	O

the	O
big	O
disagreement	O
i	O
have	O
is	O
that	O
in	O
california	O
the	O
appeals	O
process	O
is	O
so	O
extensive	O
and	O
takes	O
so	O
long	O
that	O
you	O
end	O
up	O
spending	O
a	O
huge	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
in	O
like	O
ten	O
to	O
fifteen	O
years	O
before	O
you	O
can	O
actually	O
you	O
know	O
put	O
somebody	O
to	O
death	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
a	O
crime	O

and	O
i	O
mean	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
ridiculous	O

i	O
mean	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
trial	O
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
prove	O
you	O
know	O
within	O
a	O
reasonable	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
person	O
is	O
guilty	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
have	O
appeals	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
fine	O

but	O
it	O
should	O
n't	O
take	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
few	O
years	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
should	O
think	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
years	O
maximum	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
know	O

and	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
either	O
put	O

at	O

on	O

yeah	O

it	O

it	O

tonight	O
i	O
was	O
helping	O
my	O

with	O
an	O

i	O

about	O

when	O

of	O
the	O

it	BE

it	C
was	C
almost	O
a	O

among	O

i	O

you	O

they	O

pretty	BE_IP
pretty	C
solidly	O

and	O
i	O

a	O

that	O
some	O
of	O
that	O
was	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
early	O
decisions	O
in	O
the	O
vietnam	O

that	O
the	O
people	O

as	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
draw	O
a	O

and	BE_IP
and	C

it	O

otherwise	O
there	BE
'd	IE

they	C
get	C
to	O
someplace	O

looking	O
back	O
it	O
seems	O

that	O
was	O
only	O
partly	O
true	O
that	O
there	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
better	O
place	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
line	O

i	BE
guess	IE
you	IE
can	IP
i	C
guess	C
you	C
can	C
say	O
that	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
resolve	O
and	O
willingness	O
to	O
fight	O
brought	O
the	O
cold	O

to	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
fight	O
anywhere	O
just	BE_IP
just	C
in	O
order	O
to	O
called	O
the	O

out	O
and	O

them	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
a	O

that	O
that	O
's	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
vietnamese	O

i	O
felt	O

this	O
was	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
draw	O
a	O

them	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
n't	O
come	O

and	O
we	O
were	O

you	O
know	O

like	O
as	O
i	O
said	O
the	O
more	O
i	O
hear	O
about	O
it	O
the	BE_IP
more	C_IP
i	C
can	C
see	C
each	C
decision	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
as	O
being	O
understandable	O

but	O
the	O
cumulative	O
effect	O
was	O
to	O
really	O
get	O
into	O
a	O
hopeless	O
situation	O

and	O
as	O
you	O
say	O
going	O
halfway	O
was	O
probably	O
worse	O
than	O
committing	BE_IP
committing	C
too	O
it	O
completely	O
and	O
winning	O
it	O
whatever	O
that	O

n't	O
it	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
you	O
ever	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
but	O
in	BE_IP
in	C_IP
in	C
the	O
vietnam	O

it	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
ambivalent	O

what	O
about	O
the	O

i	O
was	O

that	O

the	O
most	O

it	O

and	O
even	O

that	O

from	O

that	O

a	O

it	O

i	O

you	O

the	BE_IP
this	C

what	O

you	O

we	O

anything	O
when	O
we	O

i	O

how	O

that	O
they	O

that	O

actually	O
that	O

for	O

it	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
you	C_IE

in	C_IP
in	C
the	C

or	O
early	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
good	O

well	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
buy	O
what	O

we	O

twenty	O
five	O

along	O
with	O
my	O

japan	O
which	O
was	BE_IP
was	C
fourteen	O
or	O
fifteen	O
hundred	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
mean	O
we	BE
just	IP
we	C
got	O
a	O
monster	O
you	O

and	O
we	O
pay	O
it	O
off	O
as	BE_IP
as	C
a	O

so	O
we	O
never	O

get	O
that	O
much	O
over	BE_IP
over	C
extended	O

we	O
're	O
doing	O
it	O

we	O

but	C
we	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O

anything	O
for	O
a	O
long	O

because	O
we	BE

we	C

two	O

that	O

that	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C

about	O

that	O

but	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

part	O
about	O
it	O
i	O
've	O
looked	O
at	BE_IP
at	C
all	O

oh	O
what	O
's	O
still	O
pretty	O
good	O
to	O

why	O

but	C
unfortunately	O
my	BE_IP
my	C_IP
my	C
wife	O
leigh	O
feels	O
as	O
though	O
it	BE

it	C

an	O

thing	O
too	O
too	O

that	O

why	O
not	O

i	O

thirteen	O

but	O
too	O
late	O
we	O

that	O

yeah	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
do	O

i	BE

we	C

you	O

we	BE_IP

as	O
any	O

you	O

we	C

at	O

what	O

that	O
i	BE_IP

an	O

yeah	O

five	O

dollars	O
a	O

for	O
two	O

oh	O

my	BE_IP
mine	O

twenty	O

and	O
twenty	O
seven	O

yeah	O

i	O

now	O
are	O
up	O
what	O
five	O
dollars	O
an	O

oh	O
my	O

um-hum	O

oh	O

well	O
i	O
am	O
a	O
working	O
mother	O

i	O
have	O
three	O
children	O

and	O
my	O
children	O
since	BE
i	IP
since	C
they	C
were	O
very	O
young	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
various	O
different	O
alternatives	O
child	O
care	O
arrangement	O

and	O
like	O
most	O
to	O
working	O
mothers	O
i	O
'm	O
really	O
not	O
defensive	O
about	O
it	O

i	O
personally	O
feel	O
in	O
our	O
particular	O
situation	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
mother	O
when	O
i	O
work	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
home	O

and	O
my	O
kids	O
i	O
think	O
are	O
very	O
very	O
secure	O
well	O
raise	O
children	O

my	O
comment	O
on	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
paid	O
an	O
absolute	O
fortune	O
over	O
the	O
years	O
for	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
opportunities	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C

you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
problem	O

but	O
as	O
you	O
pointed	O
out	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
the	O
real	O
problem	O
is	O
the	O
low	O
pay	O
child	O
care	O
facility	O

and	O
that	O
is	O
sometimes	O
what	O
some	O
women	O
who	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
they	O
can	O
afford	O

when	O
our	O
children	O
were	O
very	O
young	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
pay	O
live	O
in	O
paid	O
babysitter	O
that	O
was	O
wonderful	O

and	O
then	O
as	O
they	O
got	O
older	O
they	BE
went	IE
to	IP
i	C
prefer	C
to	C
call	O
in	O
school	O

and	O
they	O
really	O
were	O
all	O
day	O
preschool	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
wonderful	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
got	O
exposed	O
to	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
neat	O
things	O

but	O
we	BE
did	IP
we	C
really	C
truly	C
did	C
pay	O
a	O
fortune	O

we	O
were	O
paying	O
at	O
one	O
point	O
well	O
about	BE_IP
about	C
oh	O
close	O
to	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
a	O
week	O
for	O
two	O
children	O

um-hum	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
physician	O
and	BE_IP
as	O
is	O
my	O
husband	O

and	BE
i	IP
and	C
i	C
felt	O
very	BE_IP
very	C
good	O
about	O
work	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
pediatrician	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
i	O
think	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
wonderful	O
child	O
care	O
opportunities	O
out	O
there	O
for	O
children	O

and	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
the	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
're	O
supposed	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
i	O
think	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
real	O
important	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
parents	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
input	O
into	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
always	O
welcome	O
in	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
activities	O
where	O
parents	O
come	O
in	O
during	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
that	O
at	O
anytime	O
you	O
can	O
drop	O
in	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
really	O
wonderful	O
arrangement	O

i	O
'm	O
with	O
the	O
university	O
actually	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
wonderful	O
program	O
that	O
started	O
at	O
age	O
three	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
a	O
block	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
hospital	O
where	O
i	O
work	O

and	O
so	O
many	O
times	O
at	O
lunchtime	O
i	O
would	O
go	O
over	O
and	O
visit	O
the	O
children	O
and	O
eat	O
with	O
them	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
doing	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
wonderful	O

they	O
had	O
things	O
like	O
gardens	O
and	O
lots	O
of	O
pets	O

they	O
had	O
a	O
four	O
to	O
one	O
teacher	O
student	O
ratio	O

well	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
sort	O
of	O
it	O

most	O
of	O
the	O
teachers	O
had	O
degrees	O

yeah	O

it	O
was	O
incredible	O
actually	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
good	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
was	O

at	O
that	O
time	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
children	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
special	O
program	O

each	O
one	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
two	O
hundred	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
then	O
in	O
addition	O
i	O
paid	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
extra	O

but	O
the	O
kids	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
really	O
had	O
some	O
great	O
opportunity	O

but	O
what	O
you	O
were	O
alluding	O
to	O
earlier	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
women	O
who	O
worked	O
for	O
minimal	O
wage	O
and	BE_IP
and	C_IP
and	C
really	O
have	O
to	O
feel	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
their	O
children	O

sometimes	O
they	O
do	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
fairly	O
low	O
paying	O
such	O

um-hum	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
really	O
i	O
think	O

it	O
's	O
been	O
a	O
while	O
since	O
i	O
've	O
looked	O
at	O

my	O
youngest	O
child	O
is	O
eight	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
since	O
i	O
've	O
looked	O
into	O
actually	O
day	O
care	O
centers	O

but	O
they	O
are	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
good	O
ones	O
do	O
cost	O
maybe	O
sixty	O
dollars	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
so	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
you	O
made	O
the	O
comment	O
earlier	O
why	O
would	O
someone	O
be	O
interested	O
in	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
real	O

they	O
're	O
having	O
some	O
good	O
entrepreneurial	O
type	O
experiences	O

and	O
i	BE
think	IP
i	C
think	C
they	O
have	O
captured	O
a	O
certain	O
market	O

yeah	O

then	O
there	O
are	O
babysitting	O
groups	O

as	O
a	O
pediatrician	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
we	O
've	O
been	O
real	O
concerned	O
about	O
as	O
infectious	O

you	O
start	O
putting	O
lots	O
of	O
little	O
kids	O
together	O
the	O
infection	O
rates	O
that	O
go	O
around	O

okay	O

so	O
you	BE
're	IP
yeah	C
i	C
guess	C
you	C
're	C
probably	O
in	O
the	O
same	BE_IP
same	C
situation	O
worrying	O

we	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
past	O
having	O
to	O

our	O

but	O

one	O
's	O
twenty	O
six	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
is	O
twenty	O
twenty	O

so	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C_IE

there	O

no	BE_IP
no	C_IP
no	C_IP

and	BE_IP
and	C
whatever	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
there	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
gap	O
that	O
between	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

and	O
all	O
that	O

and	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
a	O
thing	O
about	O
any	O
of	O
that	O

so	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
looked	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
do	O

figured	O
we	O
have	O
just	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
it	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
look	O
professional	O

so	O
we	O
left	O
it	O
left	O
it	O
to	O
somebody	O
who	O
does	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
living	O

we	O
'd	O
never	O
done	O
it	O

so	O
we	O
just	O
left	O
it	O
alone	O

but	O
that	O
's	O

i	O
guess	O
so	O
i	O
'm	O
only	O
twenty	O
one	O

so	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
vast	O

of	BE_IP

so	O
it	O

what	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
more	O

my	O

i	C_IP

i	C

oh	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
see	O

my	O

they	BE_IP
they	C

i	O

i	O
'm	O
with	O

i	O

yes	O

and	BE
so	IP
and	C_IP
and	C
the	O
reason	O
i	O
'm	O
doing	O
this	O
whole	O

because	O
you	O

rick	O
who	O

wanted	O
a	O

a	O

he	O

another	O

a	O

this	O
is	O
my	O
seventh	O
call	O

a	O
year	O

i	O
did	O
eleven	O
calls	O

and	O
so	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C_IE
's	C_IE
why	C_IP
that	C_IP
that	C
's	C
why	C
i	O
'm	O
religiously	O
getting	O

because	O
i	BE

a	IE

you	C

if	O
i	O

i	BE_IP
i	C

for	O

what	O
we	O

i	O

it	O

you	O

what	O

what	O

whether	O

not	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

they	O

they	O

with	O
what	O

i	O
understand	O
why	O

so	O
they	O
can	O
almost	O
always	O
find	O
room	O
for	O
someone	O
like	O
that	O

at	O
the	O
bottom	O
end	O
they	O
are	O
always	O
willing	O
to	O
let	O
in	O
cheap	O
labor	O
if	O
it	O
lowers	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
doing	O
business	O
in	O
some	O
particular	O
area	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
strong	O
support	O
from	O
the	O
powerful	O
people	O
in	O
that	O
area	O

those	O
are	O
two	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
are	O
going	O
on	O
although	O
they	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
politicians	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
third	O
thing	O
is	O
the	O
political	O
aspect	O
of	O
letting	O
steam	O
come	O
out	O
from	O
under	O
the	O
lid	O
in	O
mexico	O

they	O
cannot	O
close	O
off	O
the	O
mexican	O
border	O
not	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
physically	O
impossible	O
because	O
the	O
explosion	O
that	O
would	O
take	O
place	O
in	O
mexico	O
would	BE
be	IP
would	C
spill	O
over	O
to	O
this	O
country	O

so	O
they	O
keep	O
allowing	O
the	O
pressure	O
cooker	O
to	O
let	O
off	O
steam	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
few	O
things	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
found	O
myself	O
in	O
agreement	O
with	O
pat	O
buchanan	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
difficult	O
group	O
to	O
integrate	O
into	O
society	O

they	O
're	O
very	O
difficult	O
group	O
to	O
find	O
jobs	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
places	O
for	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
deny	O
that	O
we	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
involved	O
in	O
causing	O
the	O
problem	O
that	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
pretty	O
miserable	O
where	O
they	O
are	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
too	O
sympathetic	O
about	O
letting	O
large	O

yeah	O

about	O

actually	O

have	BE
you	IE

you	C

the	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
together	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
as	O
well	O
you	O
know	O

hardly	O
america	O
anymore	O

but	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
differences	O
in	O
the	O
immigrants	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
we	O
're	O
getting	O
now	O

i	O
particularly	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
the	O
illegal	O
immigration	O

i	O
think	O
probably	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
're	C
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
say	O
is	O
true	O
about	O
the	O
legal	O

but	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
illegal	O
immigration	O
we	O
're	O
getting	O
now	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
come	O
here	O
to	O
blend	O
into	O
america	O

that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
bother	O
to	O
learn	O
our	O
language	O

and	O
first	O
of	O
all	O

i	O
'm	O
sorry	O
this	O
i	O
really	O
feel	O
strongly	O
about	O
that	O

we	O
send	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O
to	O
mexico	O

i	O
just	O
currently	BE_IP
quit	C
my	O
job	O

so	O
i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
receive	O
any	O
benefits	O
right	O
yeah	O

but	O
my	O
husband	O
does	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

first	O
of	O
all	O
always	O
salary	O

second	O
the	O
second	O
thing	O
is	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
children	O

that	O
would	O
be	O
health	O
benefits	O
and	O
medical	O
benefits	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
right	O
now	O
we	O
have	O
probably	O
some	O
excellent	O
benefits	O
right	O
now	O
we	O
have	O
with	O
aetna	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
familiar	O
with	O
them	O

but	O
they	O
're	O
real	O
happy	O
with	O
them	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
another	O
good	O
thing	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
health	O
benefits	O
when	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
choices	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
with	O

and	O
that	O
really	O
helped	O
us	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O

so	O

but	O
my	O
husband	O
does	O
get	O
vacation	O

it	O
's	O
worked	O
out	O
really	O
good	O
for	O
us	O
too	O

so	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
great	O
that	O
y'all	O
can	O
work	O
that	O
out	O

yeah	O

right	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
same	O
with	O
my	O
husband	O
because	O
he	O
's	O
got	O
pretty	O
flexible	O
hours	O
if	BE_IP
as	C
long	O
as	O
he	O
puts	O
in	O
the	O
hours	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
do	O

that	O
's	O
worked	O
out	O
really	O
well	O
for	O
us	O
too	O

well	O
is	O
there	O
anything	O
else	O
that	O
you	O
look	O
for	O

you	BE
hit	IE
pretty	IP
you	C
put	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
main	O
points	O
in	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O
yeah	O

and	O
that	O
does	O
make	O
one	O
person	O
want	O
to	O
stay	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
different	O
jobs	O
with	O
various	O
types	O
in	O
the	O
computer	O
field	O

so	O
see	O
in	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
different	O
types	O
of	O
benefits	O

i	O
worked	O
for	O
space	O
telescope	O
for	O
awhile	O

there	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
really	C
i	C
'm	C
an	O
academic	O
type	O
of	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
've	O
worked	O
with	O
regular	O
you	O
know	O
industry	O
type	O
places	O
and	O
then	O
with	O
others	O
that	O
are	O
kind	O
of	O
halfway	O
between	O
and	O
stuff	O

so	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O
a	O
wide	O
range	O
of	O
both	O
you	O
know	O
nonsalary	O
type	O
benefits	O
and	O
other	O
stuff	O
like	O
health	O

that	O
either	O
fully	O
or	O
partially	O
paid	O

you	O

some	O
have	O

and	O
others	O

had	O
lots	O

but	O
not	O
much	O
other	O
types	O
of	O

so	BE_IP
yeah	C
but	C
i	O
'd	O
say	O
health	O

is	O
way	O
up	O
there	O
especially	O
pretty	O
my	O
with	O
kids	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
big	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
always	O
look	O
out	O
and	O
we	BE_IP
i	C
think	C
about	C
it	C
changing	O
jobs	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
health	O
care	O
they	O
have	O

and	O
this	O
company	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
or	O
partially	O

how	O
does	O
that	O
work	O

and	O
also	O
vacation	O
time	O
too	O
is	BE
a	IP
is	C
a	C
big	O
one	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
support	O
for	O
whatever	O
whatever	O
other	O
kinds	O
of	O
professional	O
activities	O
you	O
have	O
it	O
you	O
know	O

because	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
at	O
places	O
which	O
offer	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
sport	O
and	O
others	O
that	O
do	O
n't	O

any	O
and	O
some	O
that	O

sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
coincided	O
with	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
offers	O
more	O
vacation	O
time	O
though	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
too	O
bad	O

you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
given	O

kind	O
of	O

i	O

i	O
think	O
that	O

probably	O
definitely	O
number	O
one	O
though	O

did	O
you	O
can	O
wind	O
up	O
just	O
you	O

you	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

flexible	O

or	BE
a	IP
pretty	C
important	C

my	O

uh-huh	O

yes	O

no	O
i	BE

i	C

i	O
find	O

very	O
amusing	O
that	O
the	O

that	O

that	BE

we	C

if	O

the	O

a	O

the	O

interesting	O
topic	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

and	O
my	O

how	O

me	O
you	O

you	O

i	BE_IP
i	C

and	O
we	BE_IP
i	O

we	O
were	O

i	O

i	O
just	O
really	O

that	O

and	O
that	O
's	O

all	O

and	O
then	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
amazing	O
what	O
a	O

we	O
went	O

this	O

with	O
some	O

and	BE
it	IE

so	C
that	C
's	C

how	C

then	O
you	O

what	O

they	O

we	BE_IP

we	O

a	O

the	O
only	O
time	O
that	BE
the	IP
that	C
the	C
conversion	O

came	O

it	O

because	O
our	BE_IP

that	C

um-hum	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O

uh-huh	O

i	BE_IP

you	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

for	O
him	O

so	O

see	O
how	O
did	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
work	O
in	O
the	O

oh	O
okay	O

well	O
my	O

for	O

and	O
so	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
we	O
found	O
out	O
about	O
the	O
switchboard	O

mandatory	O
service	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O
because	O
we	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
change	O
the	O
constitution	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
allow	O
involuntary	O

in	O

to	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
that	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
avoid	O
winding	O
up	O
a	O
slave	O
state	O

i	O
like	O
the	O
idea	O

well	O
i	O
like	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
volunteer	O
voluntary	O
support	O

they	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
anyone	O
who	O
does	O
that	O
gets	O
certain	O
benefits	O
that	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
available	O
to	O
someone	O
who	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O

but	O
to	O
use	O
force	O
really	O
sets	O
us	O
a	O
essentially	O
says	O
that	O
your	O
body	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
title	O
to	O
your	O
body	O
is	O
n't	O
that	O
title	O
belongs	O
to	O
the	O
government	O

and	O
you	O
were	O
not	O
a	O
free	O
american	O
citizen	O

the	O
idea	O
itself	O
of	O
service	O
is	O
good	O

and	O
when	O
someone	O
is	O
say	O
out	O
of	O
high	O
school	O
and	O
not	O
sure	O
about	O
college	O
or	O
out	O
of	O
college	O
and	O
not	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
a	O
career	O
and	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
committed	O
a	O
huge	O
amounts	O
of	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
best	O
time	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
work	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
pay	O
very	O
well	O

yeah	O

unless	O
it	O
were	O
tied	O
directly	O

you	O
know	O
if	O
someone	O
were	O
studying	O
something	O
take	O
something	O
obscure	O
somebody	O
were	O
studying	O
economics	O
the	O
state	O

the	O

for	O
two	O

to	O
teach	O
them	O
how	O
to	O
run	O
their	O
country	O

as	O
an	O
extreme	O
example	O
right	O

but	O
in	O
reality	O
i	O
think	O
what	O
you	O
would	O
wind	O
up	O
with	O
is	O
a	O
political	O
football	O
where	O
they	O
would	O
see	O
all	O
these	O
body	O
counts	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
use	O
to	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
way	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
work	O

well	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

it	O
's	O
been	O
suggested	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
topic	O
of	O
debate	O

every	O
time	O
it	O
comes	O
up	O
it	O
gets	O
voted	O
down	O

the	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
pro-military	O
oppose	O
it	O
because	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
people	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
opt	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
military	O
into	O
something	O
else	O

and	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
pro-constitution	O
oppose	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
grounds	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
should	O
n't	O
even	O
have	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
a	O
force	O
you	O
to	O
join	O
the	O
military	O
unless	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
is	O
actually	O
under	O
attack	O

so	O
mostly	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
kind	BE
of	IP
one	C
of	C
those	O
things	O
goes	O
away	O

yeah	O
they	O
got	O
a	O
noisy	O
line	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
somewhere	O
between	O
here	O
and	O
there	O

uh-oh	O

the	O
draft	O
age	O

yeah	O

let	O
me	O
see	O
if	O
i	O
can	O
get	O
on	O
a	O
cleaner	O
line	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
my	O
line	O

that	O
's	O
my	O
line	O

that	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
radio	O
phone	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
better	O

yeah	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
figure	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
draft	O
you	O
at	O
eighteen	O

i	O
usually	O
do	O
draft	O
you	O
at	O
nineteen	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
age	O
they	O
're	O
looking	O
at	O

yeah	O
of	O
course	O
the	BE_IP
this	C
one	O
they	O
women	O
would	O
be	O
equally	O
grabbed	O

they	O
're	O
almost	O
on	O
the	O
verge	O
of	O
saying	O
that	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
gonna	O
draft	O
men	O
you	O
're	O
gonna	O
have	O
to	O
draft	O
women	O

and	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
guns	O
just	O
the	O
same	O

so	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
near	O
that	O
age	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
somebody	O
who	O
is	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
be	C
aware	O
of	O
that	O

yeah	O

okay	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
them	O
sent	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
east	O
to	O
help	O
defend	O
bush	O
from	O
saddam	O
after	O
bush	O
gets	O
done	O
arming	O
him	O

yeah	O
we	O
only	O
find	O
out	O
about	O
that	O
a	O
year	O
after	O
the	O
fact	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

i	O
went	O
in	O
doubt	O
do	O
n't	O
trust	O
the	O
government	O
at	O
all	O

really	O
reached	O
that	O
point	O

you	O
're	O
in	O
perot	O
country	O

i	O
'm	O
really	O
thinking	O
that	O
this	O

be	O
good	O
for	O
us	O

i	O
've	O
been	O

and	O
it	O
seemed	O

i	O

and	O
then	O
i	O

in	O
the	O

yeah	O

i	O
have	O
high	O
hopes	O
for	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O

he	O
could	O

in	O
interested	O
and	O
encouraged	O
to	O

the	O

that	O

a	O

i	BE

i	C

also	C
use	O

so	O
i	O

one	O
for	O

a	O

and	O
use	O
the	BE_IP

a	C

for	O
the	O

i	O

no	O
i	O

a	O

that	O
what	O

i	BE

the	BE_IP
the	C

that	O
i	O

i	O

i	O
have	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
call	O
a	O
medium	O
quality	O
craftsman	O
router	O

and	O
the	O

it	O
's	O
strong	O
enough	O
for	O
any	O

where	O
you	O

three	O

an	O

but	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
as	O
with	O

any	BE_IP
any	C
time	O
you	O
buy	O
a	O

with	BE_IP
as	C_IE

as	C
a	C
package	O
the	O
bits	O
that	O
they	O

you	O

so	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
a	O
good	O

of	O
carbide	O
steel	O
bits	O
is	O
probably	O
i	O

a	BE_IP
a	C
good	O
set	O
of	O
bits	O
is	O
probably	O
going	O
to	O
run	O
you	O
a	O

and	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
lifetime	O
i	O
suppose	O
it	O

because	O

i	O

if	O
i	O

it	O
wo	O
n't	O
last	O

and	O
i	O
've	O

so	O
that	O

the	O
thing	O
to	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
doll	O
after	O
a	O

that	BE_IP
that	C

that	O

then	O
you	O

i	O

it	BE

you	C_IP

you	C

you	BE

you	C
can	C

it	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
originally	O
was	O
from	O
california	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
big	O
difference	O
between	O
texas	O

california	O

and	O
they	O
'd	O
have	O
their	O
smog	O

and	O
where	O
you	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
stay	O
indoors	O
for	O
so	O
many	O

with	O
an	O

of	O
course	O
they	O

so	O
there	O
's	O

not	BE_IP
not	C_IP
well	C
not	C
in	O
dallas	O
that	O
's	O

yeah	O

and	O
there	O
tomorrow	O

uh-huh	O

we	O
're	O
packing	O
and	O
getting	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

okay	O

yeah	O

because	O
it	O
really	O

i	O
imagine	O
that	O

learn	O
something	O
every	O
day	O

i	O
've	O
seen	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

no	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

true	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
i	O
doubt	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
you	O
can	O
buy	O
regular	O
anymore	O

unleaded	O

yeah	O

that	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
saw	O
that	O
on	BE
t	IP
v	C
one	C
time	O

maybe	O
it	O
was	O
c	BE_IP
n	C_IP
n	C_IP
where	C
they	O
were	O
demonstrating	O
that	O
or	O
something	O
similar	O
to	O
that	O

oh	O

but	O
what	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
was	O
this	O
a	O
setback	O
that	O
they	BE_IP
i	C_IE
do	C_IE
n't	C_IE
know	C_IE
they	C_IE
went	C_IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
know	C
how	O
many	O
miles	O
an	O
hour	O
i	O
think	O
like	O
twenty	O

was	O
that	O
something	O
maybe	O
i	O
will	O

no	O

yeah	O

and	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
very	O
expensive	O
too	O

oh	O
wow	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

but	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
make	O
sense	O
because	O
if	O
they	O
want	O
people	O
to	O
convert	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
should	O
make	O
it	O
worthwhile	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O

sometimes	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
pretty	O
bad	O
here	O

like	O
today	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
bad	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	BE
it	IE
was	IP
if	C
it	C
's	C
just	O
a	O
allergies	O
or	O
what	O

some	O
days	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
very	O
nice	O
here	O
downtown	O

and	O
other	O
days	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
really	O
bad	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

but	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
kind	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
experience	O
in	O
l	O
a	O
when	O
you	O
were	O
there	O

can	O
you	O
remember	O

because	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
there	O
probably	O

well	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
when	O
they	O
had	O

so	O
air	O

yeah	O

i	O
