so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
the	O
vietnam	O
war	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

were	O
you	O
over	O
in	O
vietnam	O

i	O
was	O
much	O

i	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
sixty	O
seven	O

yeah	O

both	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
brothers	O
were	O
draft	O
age	O

but	O
neither	O
of	O
them	O
wound	O
up	O
going	O
over	O
which	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
happy	O
for	O

um-hum	O

well	O
so	O
you	BE_IP
do	C
you	C
feel	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
over	O
there	O

uh-huh	O

do	BE
you	IE
think	IP
i	C
mean	C
do	C
you	C
think	C
our	BE
invest	IP
the	C
investment	C
lives	O
in	O
money	O
was	O
worth	O
it	O

i	O
probably	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

well	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
effects	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
had	O
in	O
our	O
country	O

i	BE
think	IP
i	C
think	C
that	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
that	C
's	C
pretty	O
typical	O
of	BE
the	IP
of	C
the	C
entire	O
entire	O
involvement	O
over	O
there	O
and	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
nothing	O
was	O
really	O
address	O

it	BE
was	IE
n't	IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
was	C

we	BE_IP
we	C
announced	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
war	O

it	O
was	O
just	O
such	O
a	O
gradual	O
and	O
subtle	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
you	O
know	O
increasement	O
of	O
a	O
force	O

i	O
vaguely	O
remember	O
we	BE_IP
we	C_IE
had	C_IP
we	C
had	C
a	O
spy	O
ship	O
torpedoed	O
or	O
something	O

oh	O
yeah	O

um-hum	O

so	O
do	BE
you	IP
do	C
you	C
think	O
that	O
like	O
our	O
for	O
example	O
like	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
where	O
the	O
persian	O
gulf	O
war	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
bush	O
was	O
going	O
going	O
to	O
extraordinary	O
lengths	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
prepare	O
the	O
country	O
for	O
war	O

yeah	O

okay	O

oh	O
i	O
was	O
n't	O
really	O
keeping	O
count	O

but	O
i	O
guess	O

good-bye	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
deep	O
feelings	O

i	O
just	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
rented	O
the	O
movie	O
was	O
that	O
good	O
morning	O
vietnam	O
and	O

that	O
some	O
insight	O
there	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
help	O
me	O
put	O
together	O
the	O
feeling	O

i	O
really	O
appreciated	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
little	O
english	O
class	O
where	BE
the	IP
the	C_IP
so	C
i	O
just	O
would	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O

the	O
guys	O
garbage	O
gouging	O
your	O
eyes	O

what	O
are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
do	O

wait	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
finish	O
me	O
off	O

and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
was	O
good	O
to	O
remember	O
the	BE_IP
that	C_IP
that	C
kind	O
of	O
asian	O
philosophy	O

no	O

i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
in	O
between	O
finally	O
drew	O
a	O
high	O
draft	O
number	O

oh	O

well	O
i	BE
personally	IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
just	C
went	O
in	O
limbo	O

i	O
had	O
a	O
passport	O
and	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
or	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
join	O
special	O
forces	O
either	O
one	O

i	O
mean	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
just	O
did	O
n't	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
mark	O
what	O
was	O
that	O
again	O

no	BE_IP
not	C
really	O

downside	O

robert	O
blythe	O
says	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
grief	O
that	O
sits	O
there	O
and	O

our	O
presidents	O
have	O
always	O
avoided	O
that	O
as	O
a	O
country	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
serious	O
really	O
yeah	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
n't	O
being	O
addressed	O

yeah	O

tonkin	O
resolution	O

was	O
it	O
a	O
dolphin	O
or	O
a	O
torpedo	O

yeah	O
i	O
remember	O
that	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

only	O
it	O
was	O
foggy	O

per	O
per	O
finally	O
president	O
johnson	O
said	O
well	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
were	O
n't	O
really	O
sure	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
a	O

or	O
a	O

is	O
n't	O
that	O
something	O

okay	O
hey	O
mark	O
i	O
've	O

clear	O
out	O

they	O

a	O

sounds	O

out	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

yeah	O

most	O
of	O
our	O
vacations	O
are	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
see	O
grandma	O
and	O

we	O
get	O
an	O
occasional	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
day	O
thing	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
going	O
and	O

in	O
arizona	O

yes	O

well	O
we	O
do	O

generally	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
all	O
of	O
our	O
kids	O
back	O
home	O
for	O
the	O
holidays	O
and	O
let	O
grandma	O
and	O
grandpa	O
come	O
and	O
visit	O
us	O

they	O
range	O
from	O
twenty	O
four	O
to	O
five	O

right	O

how	O
old	O
are	O
your	O
children	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
hardest	O
thing	O
for	O
us	O
has	O
been	O
just	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
you	O
know	O
leisure	O
time	O
activities	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
our	O
kids	O
can	O
enjoy	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
age	O
span	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
you	O
know	O

like	O
the	O
older	O
kids	O
love	O
playing	O
board	O
games	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
but	O
the	O
young	O
kids	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
it	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
get	O
real	O
frustrated	O
when	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
improving	O
actually	O

we	O
had	O
an	O
interesting	O
experience	O
the	O
other	O
day	O

we	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
pretty	O
much	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
routine	O
that	O
we	O
spend	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
our	O
kids	O
play	O
with	O
other	O
kids	O
on	O
sunday	O
and	O
we	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
keep	O
them	O
at	O
home	O
and	O
our	O
next	O
door	O
neighbor	O

a	O
soccer	O
game	O
saturday	O

and	O
our	O
next	O
door	O
neighbor	O
was	O
there	O

and	O
make	O
him	O
up	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
their	O
daughter	O
could	O
spend	O
saturday	O
night	O
at	O
their	O
house	O
and	O
she	O
said	O
no	O
sundays	O
our	O
family	O
day	O
and	O
we	O
keep	O
our	O
kids	O
at	O
home	O
so	O
we	O
can	O
spend	O
time	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
those	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O
are	O
happening	O
a	O
lot	O
where	O
we	O
are	O
right	O
now	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
gone	O
to	O
one	O
extreme	O
where	O
the	O
families	O
were	O
just	O
all	O
running	O
every	O
different	O
direction	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
more	O
people	O
interested	O
in	O
spending	O
time	O
with	O
their	O
kids	O
now	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
are	O
panicked	O
how	O
kids	O
are	O
turning	O
out	O
and	O
how	O
things	O
are	O
going	O
for	O
kids	O
and	O
related	O
and	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
start	O
doing	O
something	O

so	O

you	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
texas	O

very	O
few	O

yeah	O
oh	O
definitely	O

tell	O
people	O
how	O
many	O
kids	O
we	BE
have	IP
they	C
look	C
at	O
us	O
like	O
we	O

i	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
c	O
n	O
n	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
dog	O

well	O
they	BE
have	IE
a	IE
westerner	IP
they	C

it	C
the	C
westminster	C

i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
in	O

at	BE
the	IP

the	C

once	O
a	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
kind	O
of	O
something	O
to	O

it	O
's	O
on	O
i	O

two	O
or	O
three	O

an	O

or	O
two	O

some	O
of	O

ninety	O

that	O
ninety	O

the	O

to	O
be	O
coming	O
up	O
with	O
much	O
that	O
really	O
sparks	O
my	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
yeah	O
maybe	O
that	O
could	O
do	O
something	O
to	O
affect	O
our	O
budget	O
at	O
this	O
point	O

i	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
dukakis	O
but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C

i	O
mean	O
that	O
's	O
better	O
than	O
george	O
bush	O
who	O
came	O
out	O
and	O
said	O
no	O

i	O
will	O
not	O
read	O
my	O
lips	O
or	O
whatever	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
ten	O
months	O
later	O
he	O
said	O
well	O
sorry	O
you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
ca	O
n't	O
follow	O
through	O
on	O
this	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
the	O
budget	O
is	O
so	O
out	O
of	O
hand	O

and	O
especially	O
now	O
that	O
they	O
say	O
okay	O
the	O
cold	O
war	O

and	O
we	O
're	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
getting	O
a	O
peace	O
dividend	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
x	O
number	O
of	O
billion	O
trillion	O
dollars	O
a	O
year	O

well	O
i	O
'd	O
really	O
like	O
to	O
know	O
where	O
that	O
money	O
is	O
actually	O
going	O
to	O
go	O

because	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
i	O
'm	O
ever	O
going	O
to	O
see	O
any	O
of	O
this	O
piece	O
so	O
called	O
peace	O
dividend	O

i	O
mean	O
if	O
i	O
could	O
actually	O
put	O
something	O
together	O
in	O
may	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
large	O
government	O
social	O
programs	O
either	O
because	O
i	O
feel	O
that	O
they	O
waste	O
money	O
also	O

but	O
with	O
this	O
peace	O
dividend	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
you	O
could	O
set	O
up	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
public	O
works	O
projects	O
like	O
they	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
thirties	O
or	O
whatever	O

exactly	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
that	O
way	O
we	O
could	O
really	O
focus	O
on	O
building	O
the	O
interest	O
group	O
structure	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

yeah	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
way	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
ever	O
really	O
recover	O
from	BE_IP
from	C
the	O
state	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
in	O
right	O
now	O
unless	O
at	O
least	O
i	O
feel	O
unless	O
we	O
focus	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
surely	O
do	O
n't	O
hear	O
anybody	O
saying	O
that	O
right	O
now	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

you	BE_IP
you	C
just	O
have	O
to	O
wonder	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
thinking	O
in	O
washington	O

well	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
important	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
loaded	O
cannon	O

i	O

they	O
've	O
got	O
trillions	O
of	O
dollars	O
to	O

every	O

in	O
my	O

oh	O
no	O

for	BE

for	C
the	C
moment	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
what	O

the	O
about	O
what	O
george	O

on	O
the	O

that	O
he	O

everything	O
that	O

that	O
it	O

much	O
of	O
a	O
difference	O

yeah	O

oh	O

yeah	O

seems	O
to	O
me	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
everyone	O
's	O

you	O

their	O
token	O

when	BE

just	O
such	O
a	O

time	O
for	O
it	O

yeah	O
yeah	O
the	O
ninety	O
seven	O

a	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
nothing	O
you	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
actually	O
because	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
the	BE

i	O
just	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
changing	O
my	O
lifestyle	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
yeah	O
in	BE
retrospect	IE
was	IP
it	C
was	C
mondale	O
or	O
dukakis	O
that	O
said	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O
right	O
now	O
i	O
'm	O
gonna	O
raise	O

it	O
was	O
dukakis	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
respect	O
for	O
him	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
idea	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
the	O
conservation	O
corps	O

what	O
would	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
would	C
help	O
unemployment	O
greatly	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

our	O
infrastructure	O
is	O
and	O

i	O
mean	O
we	BE_IP
we	C_IE
were	C_IP
we	C
hurt	C
ourselves	O
incredibly	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
fifty	O
years	O

um-hum	O

i	O
agree	O
totally	O

it	O
just	O
seems	O
so	BE_IP
yeah	C
so	C
ridiculous	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
allowed	O
to	O
happen	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
in	O
college	O
right	O
now	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
go	O
to	O
georgia	O
tech	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
the	O
required	O
political	O
science	O
class	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
we	O
discussed	O
was	O
you	O
know	O
where	BE_IP
where	C
the	O
budget	O
situation	O
how	O
the	O
budget	O
situation	O
just	O
gotten	O
so	O
out	O
of	O
hand	O

and	O
essentially	O
what	O
happened	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
tax	O
year	O
of	O
eighty	O
one	O

reagan	O
basically	O
said	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
this	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
task	O
that	O
the	O
taxpayers	O
and	O
created	O
this	O
ludicrous	O
budget	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IP
that	C
the	O
congress	O
would	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
mind	O
pass	O
and	O
congress	O
realizing	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
gonna	O
lose	O
a	O
democratic	O
congress	O
realizing	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
gonna	O
lose	O
a	O
propaganda	O
war	O
you	O
know	O
by	BE_IP
by	C_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
by	C_IP
by	C
removing	O
the	O
tax	O
cut	O
further	O
cut	O
the	O
taxes	O
and	O
created	O
you	O
know	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
you	O
know	O
and	O
created	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
huge	O
deficit	O
that	O
year	O
which	O
moved	O
us	O
into	O
the	O
trillion	O
dollar	O
deficit	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
playing	O
chicken	O
with	O
a	O
loaded	O
gun	O

yeah	O

what	O
really	O
bothers	O
me	O
is	O
it	O
just	O
seems	O
like	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
anyone	O
were	O
to	O
say	O
you	O
know	O
well	O
i	O
'm	O
gonna	BE_IP
raise	C
taxes	O
and	O
cut	O
the	O
budget	O
and	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C_IE
're	C_IP
we	C
're	C
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
unpopular	O
things	O
i	O
mean	O
he	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
chance	O
of	O
getting	O
elected	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
room	O
in	O
the	O
bread	O
and	O
circuses	O
thing	O
you	O
know	O
where	BE_IP
where	C
people	O
just	O
want	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
you	O
know	O
whatever	O
will	O
make	O
them	O
feel	O
good	O
right	O
now	O

yeah	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
george	O
bush	O
will	O
make	O
the	O
american	O
people	O
happy	O
with	O
ninety	O
seven	O
cents	O
a	O
week	O

i	O
just	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
well	O
thought	O
out	O
incentive	O

so	O
martin	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
crime	O
in	O
the	O
city	O

you	O
said	O
you	O
're	O
from	O
atlanta	O

um-hum	O

i	O
mean	O
do	O
you	O
find	O
crime	O
in	O
atlanta	O
really	O

i	O
live	O
in	O
atlanta	O
also	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
can	O
be	O
done	O
about	O
the	O
crime	O

yeah	O
probably	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
true	O

so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
atlanta	O
's	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
most	O
other	O
cities	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
l	O
a	O

yeah	O
i	BE
do	IE
n't	IE
think	IE
we	IE
do	IE
n't	IP
we	C
have	C
as	C
much	C
of	C
the	C
gang	C
problem	C
it	C
's	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
cities	O
have	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
'm	O
going	O
to	BE
the	IP
to	C
the	C
conclusion	O
also	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
walking	O
into	O
downtown	O
area	O
you	O
know	O
where	BE_IP
where	C
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
crime	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
just	BE_IP
just	C
keeping	O
your	O
senses	O
about	O
you	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
trying	O
not	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
a	O
victim	O
you	O
know	O

you	O
know	O
walk	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
walk	C
with	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
with	C
necessarily	O
but	O
just	O
walk	O
you	O
know	O
confidently	O

you	O
know	O
do	BE
n't	IP
do	C
n't	C
be	O
looking	O
around	O
like	O
you	O
've	O
never	O
been	O
there	O
before	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
where	O
you	O
are	O

yeah	O
um-hum	O
um-hum	O
yeah	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
mugged	O
in	O
atlanta	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
pretty	O
lucky	O
about	O
getting	O
mugged	O

oh	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
've	O
only	O
actually	O
seen	O
like	O
one	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
one	C
actual	O
robbery	O
with	O
a	O
gun	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
about	O
the	O
only	O
you	O
know	O
real	O
violent	O
crime	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
potentially	O
violent	O
crime	O
that	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O
in	O
atlanta	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
a	O
guy	O
running	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
store	O
that	O
he	O
just	O
robbed	O

oh	O
really	O

oh	O
where	BE_IP
where	C
was	O
that	O

downtown	O

metropolitan	O

i	BE
've	IP
actually	C
i	C
've	C
known	O
some	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
had	O
their	O
cars	O
stolen	O

you	O
know	O
but	O
half	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
the	BE_IP
a	C
p	O
d	O
seems	O
to	O
recover	O
them	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
various	O
states	O
of	O
disrepair	O

up	O
on	O

a	O
friend	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
v	O
w	O
rabbit	O

when	BE
he	IP
when	C
he	C
got	O
it	O
back	O
is	O
dashboard	O
was	O
sitting	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
his	O
front	O

well	O
you	O
're	O
probably	O
luckier	O
than	O

sort	O
of	O
like	O
insurance	O
paid	O
for	O
the	O
body	O
damage	O

um-hum	O

so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
this	O
much	O
about	O
stealing	O
cars	O

right	O

actually	O
i	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
concern	O
of	O
mine	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
safety	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
bad	O
in	O
certain	O
areas	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
area	O
that	O
i	O
live	O
in	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
crime	O
level	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
other	O
areas	O
of	BE
the	IP
of	C
the	C
city	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
certain	O
areas	O
where	O
the	O
crime	O
is	O
focused	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
it	BE
's	IP
what	C
's	C
been	O
happening	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
several	O
years	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
've	O
been	O
beefing	O
up	O
the	O
police	O
patrols	O
trying	O
to	O
put	BE_IP
put	C
more	O
guys	O
more	O
cops	O
higher	O
visibility	O

and	O
it	O
had	O
some	O
impact	O
but	O
not	O
a	O
tremendous	O
amount	O

and	O
probably	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
increase	O
community	O
involvement	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
thing	O
i	O
think	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
particularly	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
housing	O
projects	O
you	O
know	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
tends	O
to	O
be	O
where	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
crime	O
is	O
focused	O
and	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
just	O
having	BE_IP

there	O

they	O
've	O

to	O

we	O

so	O
we	O

all	O
those	O
too	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
problems	O
with	O
is	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
woodworking	O

through	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
bought	O
this	O
paint	O

where	O
they	O
advertise	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
nontoxic	O
and	O
such	O

and	O
when	O

the	O
product	O
it	O
ends	O
up	O
being	O
toxic	O
and	O
all	O
these	O

so	O

i	O
did	O

it	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
cost	O
me	O
more	O
than	O

i	O
just	O
ended	O
up	O
using	O
it	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
gone	O
wrong	O

and	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

two	O

oh	O

frustrating	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
i	O

well	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C

a	O

with	O
the	O

test	O
everything	O

so	O
are	BE_IP
testing	C
is	C
pretty	C
thorough	O

the	O
tests	O
that	O

well	O
we	O
test	O
every	O
one	O
electrically	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
test	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
a	O
day	O
actually	O
exploding	O
the	O
air	O

and	BE_IP
but	C
we	O
do	O
test	O
after	BE_IP
during	C
the	O
assembly	O
project	O
product	O
after	O
we	O
assemble	O
each	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

or	O
what	O

the	O
bag	O
we	O
check	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
their	O
after	O
we	O

it	O

so	O
each	O
assembly	O
process	O
has	O
an	O
inspection	O
right	O
after	O
it	O
's	O
done	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
do	O
electrical	O
tests	O
on	O
them	O
during	O
the	O
process	O

well	O
they	O
do	O
the	BE_IP
all	C
the	C
testing	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
through	O
the	O
government	O

that	O
's	O
incredible	O
how	O
much	O
testing	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
do	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
too	O
many	O
problems	O

seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
everything	O
that	O
i	O
buy	O
goes	O
bad	O
just	O
after	O
the	O
warranty	O
runs	O
out	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
a	O
dryer	O
an	O
ice	O
maker	O
a	O
microwave	O
all	O
three	O

unfortunately	O
i	O
bought	O
them	O
all	O
three	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
when	O
i	O
bought	O
my	O
new	O

and	O
i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O

so	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
call	O
and	O
have	O
them	O
all	O
repaired	O

a	O
hassle	O

yeah	O

the	O
warranty	O
on	O
the	O
refrigerator	O

the	O
refrigerator	O
warranty	O
still	O
good	O

but	O
the	O
ice	O
maker	O
itself	O
lasted	O
three	O
years	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
three	O
years	O
and	O
two	O
months	O

yeah	O

i	O
watch	O
out	O

i	O
usually	O
have	O
pretty	O
good	O

with	O

but	O
i	O
just	O

it	O
was	O
within	O
two	O

at	O
all	O
three	O
of	O
these	O
stopped	O
working	O

the	O
ice	O

was	BE_IP
had	C
to	O

a	O

and	O
the	O

some	O

i	O

even	O

yeah	O

the	O
dryer	O
had	O
to	O

a	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
almost	O
three	O

for	O
all	O
three	O
of	O
them	O

within	O
two	O

it	O
was	O

a	O

pretty	O

and	BE_IP
plus	C
the	O
place	O
that	O
i	O
'd	O
bought	O
them	O
all	O
had	O
gone	O
out	O

so	O
even	BE

the	O

that	C

but	O

or	O

i	O

that	O
because	O

it	O

it	O
for	O

they	O
usually	O
sign	O
a	O
contract	O
or	O
something	O
and	O
i	O
did	O
have	O
surgery	O
last	O
summer	O

and	O
i	O
paid	O
ten	O
dollars	O
when	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
that	O
first	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
seen	O
another	O
bill	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
have	O
to	O
say	O
it	O
really	O
works	O

but	O
again	O
i	O
was	O
fortunate	O
because	O
my	O
doctor	O
agreed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
it	O

if	O
you	O
've	O
been	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
doctor	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
ten	O
years	O
or	O
something	O
and	O
he	O
elects	O
not	O
to	O
join	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
stressful	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
those	O
people	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
you	O
know	O
have	O
a	O
family	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
everybody	O
's	O
gone	O
to	O
different	O
doctors	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
give	O
up	O
somebody	O
who	O
you	O
feel	O
knows	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
body	O
and	O
you	O
're	O
just	O
has	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
the	O
medical	O
history	O

do	O
you	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
with	O
it	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
stressful	O

my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
just	O
elected	O
that	O
if	O
that	O
happens	O
i	O
will	O
go	O
and	O
just	O
pay	O

you	O
can	O
continue	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
your	O
own	O
doctor	O
but	O
your	O
benefits	O
are	O
not	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
good	O

so	O

right	O

are	O
you	O
talking	O
about	O
like	O
spring	O
break	O

right	O

it	O
really	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
teachers	O

no	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
a	O
teacher	O

and	O
a	O
secretarial	O
executive	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	O
teachers	O
could	O
stand	O
the	O
stress	O
all	BE_IP
all	C
year	O
long	O
frankly	O

it	O
is	O
just	O
texas	O
has	O
really	O

they	O
want	O
everybody	O
educated	O
no	O
matter	O
what	O
it	O
costs	O

and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
would	O
be	O
just	O

we	O
all	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O

in	O
two	O
weeks	O
we	O
have	O
spring	O
break	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
who	O
looks	O

to	O
it	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
students	O
or	O
the	O
teachers	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
there	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

i	O
would	O
think	O
that	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
employment	O
you	BE
're	IP
you	C
're	C
one	O
day	O
you	O
might	O
be	O
really	O
tuned	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
the	O
next	O
day	O
yeah	O
little	O
lukewarm	O
or	O
something	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
good	O
that	O
they	O
allow	O
you	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
say	O
the	O
school	O

well	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
day	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
get	O
many	O
days	O
off	O

and	O
we	O
all	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
i	O
work	O
there	O
is	O
that	O
my	O
children	O
now	O
have	O
graduated	O
and	O
graduated	O
from	O
college	O

but	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

worked	O
there	O
because	O
my	O
hours	O

the	O
same	O
as	O
theirs	O
and	O
i	O
've	O

's	O
really	O
fun	O

always	O
just	O
had	O
a	O
heck	O
of	O
a	O
time	O
getting	O
that	O
ankle	O
healthy	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
what	O

does	O

his	BE_IP
his	C
brace	O
and	O
as	O
high	O
tops	O

um-hum	O

oh	O

wow	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
dear	O

it	O
's	O
amazing	O
how	O
fast	O
you	O
take	O
off	O
the	O
inches	O
and	O
i	BE
would	IP
once	C
i	C
start	C
my	C
forty	C
i	C
'd	C
like	C
to	O
do	O
the	O
forty	O
five	O
minutes	O
a	O
day	O
on	O
the	O
bike	O
for	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
then	O
every	O
other	O
day	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
incorporate	O
the	O
video	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
bike	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
day	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
amazing	O
how	O
fast	O
the	O
inches	O
come	O
off	O

and	O
the	O
muscle	O
builds	O
real	O
fast	O

you	O
can	O
start	O

they	O
recommend	O
doing	O
the	O
video	O
without	O
weights	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
month	O

and	O
then	O
after	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
start	O
with	O
your	O
five	O
pound	O
dumbbells	O
and	O
then	O
build	O
up	O
to	O
your	O
twenty	O
five	O
pound	O
dumbbells	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
just	O
doing	O
repetitious	O
exercises	O
throughout	O
the	O
whole	O
video	O

our	O
long	O
video	O

it	O
is	O

i	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
that	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
losing	O
this	O
weight	O
and	O
being	O
firm	O
unhealthy	O

yeah	O

yes	O

now	O
this	O
one	O
has	O
been	O
quite	O
mild	O

we	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
out	O
walking	O
throughout	O
the	O
whole	O
winter	O
because	O
we	BE
really	IP
we	C
only	C
had	O
about	O
three	O
weeks	O
of	O
snow	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O

it	O
was	O
quite	O
chilly	O

but	O
not	O

i	O
like	O
to	O
play	O
basketball	O
and	O
weight	O
lifting	O

those	O
are	O
probably	O
the	O
two	O
main	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
do	O

yeah	O

in	BE_IP
in	C
the	O
winter	O
you	O
typically	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
probably	O
too	O
cold	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
do	O
things	O
like	O
tennis	O

i	O
like	O
to	O
play	O
tennis	O
in	O
the	O
summertime	O
or	O
in	O
the	O
spring	O
fall	O

but	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
it	O
gets	O
pretty	O
cold	O

yeah	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
indoor	O
sports	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

do	O
you	O
do	O
any	O
anaerobic	O
type	O
weight	O
lifting	O
or	O
weight	O
training	O
type	O
thing	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C_IE
's	C_IE
a	C_IE
rope	C_IP
it	C
's	C
similar	C
to	O
aerobics	O
with	O
weights	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
low	O
impact	O
aerobics	O
use	O
weights	O

are	O
you	O
familiar	O
with	O
step	O
or	O
bench	O
aerobics	O

in	O
atlanta	O
that	O
's	O

most	O
of	O
the	O
health	O
clubs	O
or	O

that	BE
's	IE
the	IP
that	C
's	C
the	C
in	O
thing	O

at	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
regular	O
aerobics	O

now	O
venture	O
step	O
aerobics	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
taken	O
over	O

it	BE_IP
they	C
call	C
it	C
a	O
low	O
impact	O
aerobics	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
supposed	O
to	O
burn	O
off	O
more	O
calories	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

from	O
what	O
i	O
've	O
done	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
does	O
give	O
you	O
a	BE
good	IP
a	C
real	C
good	C
workout	O

but	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
'm	O
concerned	O
about	O
is	O
potential	O
for	O
injury	O
to	O
your	O
knees	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
movement	O
of	O
going	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
step	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
could	O
create	O
a	O
problem	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
seem	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
wo	O
n't	O

you	O
never	O
know	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
my	O
ankles	O
probably	O
my	O
lame	BE_IP
weak	C
point	O

but	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
kind	O
of	O
taken	O
care	O
of	O
that	O

we	O
're	O
high	O
tops	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
on	O
a	O
support	O
ankle	O
brace	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
stuff	O
and	O
we	O
're	O
wearing	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
any	O
problems	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
year	O
or	O
so	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

i	BE
did	IP
i	C
injured	C
mine	O
so	O
many	O
times	O
rehabilitating	BE_IP
became	C
quite	O
easy	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
would	O
only	O
take	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
play	O
again	O
on	O
it	O
because	O
after	O
a	O
while	O
you	O
just	O
learn	O
how	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
rehabilitate	O
yourself	O
and	O
play	O
that	O
way	O

so	O
how	BE_IP
how	C
successful	O
is	O
your	O
exercise	O
video	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
workout	O

um-hum	O

so	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
i	O
guess	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

it	O
's	O
quite	O
cold	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
snow	O

so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
your	O
current	O
event	O
information	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

i	O
would	O
imagine	O
going	O
to	O
college	O
though	O
your	O
professors	O
and	O
different	O
things	O

i	O
keep	O
up	O
on	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
housewife	O

i	O
have	O
three	O
kids	O

so	O
i	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
information	O
probably	O
through	O
just	O
the	O
news	O
at	O
six	O
o'clock	O
and	O
then	O
talking	O
with	O
people	O
and	O
just	O
hearing	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

but	O
just	O
the	O
regular	O
channel	O
just	O
channel	O
eight	O

that	O
's	O
our	O
channel	O
here	O

eyewitness	O
news	O

so	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
elections	O
they	O
choose	O
who	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
follow	O
and	O
who	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

basically	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
i	O
can	O
a	O
candidate	O
can	O
get	O
them	O
to	O
follow	O
then	O
the	O
news	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
kind	O
of	O
publicize	O
his	O
name	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
get	O
the	O
news	O
is	O
the	O
right	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
it	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
very	O
lopsided	O
picture	O
of	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

right	O

and	O
the	O
news	O
to	O
it	O
just	O
does	O
n't	O
cover	O
that	O
many	O
stories	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
just	O
covers	O
your	O
basic	O
you	O
know	O
violent	O
crimes	O
and	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
and	C_IP
and	C
you	O
're	O
too	O
catastrophes	O
with	O
weather	O
and	O
stuff	O

but	O
other	O
than	O
that	O
you	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

i	O
will	O
read	O
our	O
current	O
letters	O
that	O
come	O
out	O
on	O
election	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
read	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
study	O
who	O
was	O
running	O
in	O
our	O
area	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
study	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
economy	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
read	O
other	O
magazines	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
get	O
my	O
information	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
read	O
every	O
month	O
the	O
reader	O
's	O
digest	O
but	O
now	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
just	O
have	O
friends	O
that	O
clip	O
articles	O

if	O
i	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
'm	C
interested	O
in	O
something	O
of	O
course	O
during	O
the	O
war	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
war	O
i	O
read	O
up	O
on	O
that	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
in	O
the	O
newspaper	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O

but	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
times	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
wish	O
i	O
had	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
read	O
all	O
the	O
stories	O
and	O
the	O
newspaper	O

but	O
i	O
just	O
ca	O
n't	O
seem	O

right	O
it	O

appropriate	O
right	O
now	O
because	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
they	O

opinions	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
you	O

just	O
you	O

i	O
subscribe	O

and	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
real	O
good	O
because	O
it	O
gives	O

a	O
brief	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
remember	O
back	O
during	BE
the	IP
during	C
the	C
war	O
everyone	O
here	O
at	O
work	O
always	O
have	O
the	O
radio	O
or	O
the	O
t	O
v	O
on	O
because	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
constantly	O
that	O
stuff	O

and	O

yeah	O

if	BE
they	IE
reported	IE
every	IP
if	C
they	C
reported	C
every	C
violent	C
crime	O
in	O
atlanta	O
it	BE
would	IE
take	IP
it	C
would	C
probably	C
take	C
the	O
whole	O

hour	O

but	O

oh	O
yeah	O

they	BE
still	IP
already	C
they	C
're	C
having	O
like	O

and	O
the	O
newspaper	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
section	O
i	O
think	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
on	O
the	O
olympics	O

and	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
like	O
account	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
sixteen	O
hundred	O
days	O
or	O
something	O

oh	O
really	O

that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
crazy	O
that	O
time	O
of	O
year	O
here	O

but	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
believe	O
i	O
mean	O

they	O
're	O
stretching	O
out	O
the	O
olympic	O
news	O
for	O
that	O
much	O
coverage	O
over	O

i	O
guess	O
people	O
want	O
to	O
hear	O
about	O
it	O

oh	O
so	O
big	BE_IP
big	C
news	O
right	O
now	O
is	O
the	O
braves	O
because	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
in	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
try	C
spring	O
training	O
or	O
whatever	O
and	BE
then	IP
so	C
well	O
last	O
year	O

yeah	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O

it	O
's	O
the	O
way	O
they	O
do	O
the	O
newscast	O
i	O
wish	O
they	O
'd	O
be	O
kind	O
of	O
separated	O
it	O

if	BE
you	IP
if	C
you	C
wanted	O
to	O
watch	O
one	O
thing	O
you	O
could	O
turned	O
us	O
some	O
channel	O
for	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
cable	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
one	O
advantage	O
of	O
having	O
the	O
unanimous	O
verdict	O
is	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
criminal	O
case	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
convict	O
someone	O
who	O
really	O
should	O
n't	O
be	O
convicted	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
unanimous	O
verdict	O
it	O
helps	O
to	O
insure	O
that	O

i	O
guess	O
maybe	O
one	O
drawback	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
one	O
juror	O
who	O
is	O
very	O
unreasonable	O
in	O
some	O
way	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
would	O
n't	O
convict	O
someone	O
who	O
maybe	O
should	O
be	O
convicted	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O
before	O

what	O
sorts	O
of	O
cases	O
where	O
they	O

so	O
where	O
they	O
criminal	O
or	O
civil	O

oh	O
okay	O

what	BE_IP
what	C
was	O
the	O
verdict	O

did	O
the	O
jury	O
have	O
trouble	O
reaching	O
a	O
decision	O

yeah	O

so	O
did	O
it	O
become	O

yeah	O

but	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
civil	O
case	O
it	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
matter	O
right	O

just	O
needed	O
a	O
majority	O

what	BE
was	IP
what	C
was	C
the	O
other	O
case	O

that	O
was	O
also	O
civil	O

yeah	O

oh	O
really	O

yeah	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	O
college	O
student	O

so	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
you	O
know	O
of	O
a	O
jury	O
eligible	O
age	O
for	O
very	O
long	O
and	O
i	O
did	O
get	O
one	O
summons	O
actually	O
at	O
one	O
point	O

declined	O
it	O
which	O
i	O
'm	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
student	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
time	O

yeah	O
i	O
mean	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
really	C_IP
i	C
would	O
like	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
do	O
it	O
at	O
some	O
point	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
have	O
n't	O

one	BE_IP
one	C
thing	O
that	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
is	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
maybe	C
is	C
a	O
problem	O
is	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
criminal	O
jury	O
system	O
works	O
pretty	O
well	O
now	O

but	O
i	O
wonder	O
if	BE_IP
maybe	C
in	C
some	O
civil	O
cases	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
work	O
as	O
well	O

especially	O
sort	O
of	O

oh	O

but	O
you	O
thought	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O

yeah	O

oh	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O

and	O
the	O
jurors	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O

someone	O
had	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O

that	O
's	O
interesting	O

did	O
it	O
work	O
out	O
pretty	O
woman	O

i	O
mean	O
did	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
people	O
sort	O
of	O
gradually	O
sort	O
of	O
assume	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
moderator	O
role	O
in	O
the	O
trial	O

so	O
it	BE
worked	IP
it	C
did	C
end	O
up	O
working	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O

the	O
one	O
thing	O
i	O
sometimes	O
wonder	O
about	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
is	O
whether	O
especially	O
sort	O
of	O
in	O
maybe	O
like	O
pry	O
product	O
liability	O
or	O
medical	O
malpractice	O
where	O
there	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
technical	O
decision	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
sometimes	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
just	O
a	O
matter	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
you	O
know	O
did	O
this	O
guy	O
rip	O
off	O
this	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
interpreting	O
a	O
contract	O

sort	O
of	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
sometimes	O
getting	O
into	O
very	O
technical	O
issues	O

and	O
i	O
wonder	O
if	BE_IP
if	C_IE
there	IE
's	IE
really	IP
if	C
the	C
system	C
works	O
adequately	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
educating	O
the	O
jurors	O
about	O
whatever	O
you	O
know	O
issue	O
was	O
under	O
discussion	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
you	O
were	O
involved	O
in	O
you	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
bank	O
matter	O
of	O
some	O
kind	O

so	O

yeah	O

oh	O
so	O
the	O
deal	O
was	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
borrowed	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
bank	O
to	O
buy	O
it	O

yeah	O
made	O
the	O
payments	O

yeah	O

so	O
they	O
were	O
suing	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
back	O

yeah	O

definitely	O

um-hum	O

i	O
have	O
twice	O

pretty	O
wild	O
experience	O

they	O
were	O
just	O
you	O
know	O
small	O
town	O
cases	O
where	O
trailers	O
and	O
banks	O
were	O
involved	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
were	O
civil	O

they	O
were	O
n't	O
in	O
criminal	O

oh	O
the	O
jury	O
it	BE
was	IP
i	C
think	C
it	C
was	C
ten	O
to	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O
because	O
they	O
only	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
eleven	O
people	O
so	O

and	O
the	O
one	O
changed	O
his	O
boat	O
at	O
the	O
end	O

so	O
it	O
became	O
unanimous	O
you	O
know	O
after	O
they	O
turned	O
it	O
in	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
changed	O
his	O
mind	O
after	O
they	O
turned	O
it	O
in	O
but	O
it	O
then	O
became	O
unanimous	O

right	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
other	O
case	O
with	O
just	O
traffic	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
seat	O
belt	O
law	O
and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
did	O
n't	O
even	O
hardly	O
go	O
through	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
you	O
learn	O
a	O
lot	O
going	O
through	O
the	O
jury	O
like	O
that	O
so	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
would	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
i	O
mean	O
from	BE_IP
from	C_IP
from	C
what	O
i	O
experienced	O
in	O
them	O

it	O
did	BE
n't	IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
did	C_IE
n't	C_IP
did	C
n't	C
turn	O
out	O
the	BE_IP
the	C_IE
way	IE
i	IE
planned	IE
it	IP
i	C
mean	C
the	C
way	C
that	C
i	C
would	C
think	C
that	C
it	O
would	O
go	O

it	O
turned	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O
yeah	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
you	O
know	O

jury	O
was	O
unorganized	O

it	BE
was	IP
it	IE
was	C_IE
just	C_IP
was	C
n't	C
organized	O
enough	O
for	O
me	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
used	O
to	O
it	O
not	O
being	O
organized	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
assumed	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O

that	O
's	O
about	O
what	O
it	O
was	O

yeah	O

well	O
they	O
picked	O
one	O
person	O

and	O
then	O
he	O
finally	O
you	O
know	O
moderated	O
everything	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
should	O
have	O

yeah	O

ended	O
up	O
working	O
on	O
it	O

yeah	O

oh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
educate	O
them	O
enough	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
really	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

yeah	O

the	O
bank	O
was	O
suing	O
them	O
for	BE_IP
because	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
get	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
trailer	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
assumingly	O
their	O
property	O

it	O
was	O
on	O
his	O
property	O

so	O
they	O
came	O
to	O

it	O

and	O
then	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O

it	O
well	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
landlord	O
property	O

and	O
he	O
would	O

let	O
them	O

that	O
it	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
i	BE_IP

you	O

a	O

back	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
commits	O
another	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
maybe	O
a	O

solution	O
to	O
capital	O

might	O
be	O
reserve	O
it	O
solely	O
for	O

of	O
a	O

like	O
murder	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
seems	O
sensible	O
and	O
fail-safe	O

not	O
completely	O
fail-safe	O

but	O
if	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
convicted	O
of	O
two	O
murders	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
chance	O
that	O
something	O
's	O
wrong	O

i	O
also	O

i	O
tell	O
you	O
how	O
liberal	O
i	O
have	O
turned	O
towards	O
this	O
or	BE_IP
or	C_IP
or	C
whatever	O
side	O
that	O
's	O
i	O
've	O
kind	O
of	O
chosen	O

i	O
believe	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
big	O
time	O
drug	O
importers	O
like	O
say	O
noriega	O
for	O
example	O
these	O
people	O

from	O

and	O
i	BE
think	IP
i	C
think	C
the	O
death	O

is	O
the	O
best	O
choice	O
for	O
those	O
people	O
because	O
really	O
any	O

of	O
jail	O

for	O
them	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
another	O

uh-huh	O

do	O
you	O

are	BE_IP
there	C
are	C
cases	O
where	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
the	O
capital	O
capital	O

should	O
n't	O
be	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

sure	O

i	BE
understand	IP
i	C
understand	C
your	O
point	O

yeah	O

oh	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
with	BE_IP
with	C_IP
with	C
dahlmer	O
now	O
you	O
realize	O
they	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
i	C_IP
i	C
think	O
it	O
's	O
ohio	O
gets	O
to	O
try	O
them	O
next	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
have	O
the	O

yeah	O

so	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
curious	O
case	O

something	O
is	O
sort	O
of	O
nightmarish	O
they	O
leave	O

well	O
here	O
in	O
texas	O

i	O
think	O
even	BE_IP
even	C
this	O
last	O
week	O
last	O
week	O
they	O
had	O
another	O
they	O
you	O

they	O
use	O
their	O
capital	O

by	O
lethal	O

yeah	O

we	O
do	O
have	O
the	O
death	O

here	O

not	O
exercised	O
very	O
often	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
it	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
even	O
remember	O
the	O
last	O
execution	O
we	BE
had	IE
here	IP
actually	C
personally	C
i	C
'm	C
in	C
favor	C
of	O
capital	O

i	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	BE
of	IP
lot	C
of	C
problems	O
with	O
it	O

but	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
some	O
crimes	O
are	O
just	O
so	O
heinous	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
the	O
person	O
just	O
i	O
feel	O
does	O
n't	O
deserve	O
to	O
live	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
deserve	O
for	O
the	O
tax	O
payers	O
to	O
spend	O
however	O
many	O
thousands	O
of	O
dollars	O
it	O
costs	O
a	O
year	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
prison	O
for	O
life	O

i	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
problems	O
with	O
that	O

well	O
they	O
say	O
okay	O
if	O
you	O
declare	O
someone	O
put	O
them	O
on	O
death	O
row	O
and	O
execute	O
them	O
well	O
then	O
ten	O
years	O
later	O
you	O
find	O
out	O
that	O
he	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
then	O
that	O
life	O
was	O
wasted	O

but	O
just	O
seems	O
like	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
that	O
it	BE
's	IE
a	IP
it	C
's	C
a	C
good	O
policy	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

right	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
thought	O
that	O
i	O
had	O
never	O
really	O
had	O
on	O
that	O
which	O
seems	O
pretty	O
sensible	O

right	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

you	O
're	O
right	O
there	O

i	BE_IP
basically	C
my	C
views	O
i	O
guess	O
they	O
tend	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
economically	O
oriented	O
in	O
that	O
i	BE
just	IP
you	C
know	C
they	C
come	O
out	O
with	O
these	O
figures	O
that	O
it	O
costs	O
fifty	O
thousand	O
dollars	O
taxpayer	O
dollars	O
a	O
year	O
to	O
keep	O
someone	O
alive	O
in	O
jail	O
when	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
there	O
for	O
life	O

they	O
're	O
never	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
rehabilitated	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
prison	O
system	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
today	O
does	O
much	O
towards	O
rehabilitation	O
to	O
begin	O
with	O
so	O
to	O
me	O
i	O
'm	O
paying	O
taxes	O
you	O
know	O
twenty	O
percent	O
of	O
my	O
check	O
or	O
whatever	O
to	O
keep	O
somebody	O
alive	O
who	BE
i	IP
in	C
my	C
mind	O
should	O
n't	O
be	O
there	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
and	O
there	O
's	O
never	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
valuable	O
or	O
worthwhile	O
part	O
of	O
society	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
all	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
on	O
that	O
question	O

it	O
just	O
seems	O
like	O

for	O
instance	O
the	O
jeffrey	O
dahmer	O
case	O

i	O
mean	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
person	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
ever	O
be	O
a	O
worthwhile	O
part	O
of	O
society	O

i	O
hope	O
the	O
guy	O
never	O
gets	O
back	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
streets	O
and	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
wisconsin	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O

so	O
he	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
sentenced	O
to	O
life	O
imprisonment	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
he	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
live	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
playing	O
god	O
which	O
is	O
never	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

but	O
cases	O
where	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
should	O
be	O
withheld	O
not	O
really	O
that	O
i	O
can	O
think	O
of	O

i	BE
would	IP
i	C
would	C
be	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
murders	O
and	O
like	O
you	O
said	O
repeat	O
murders	O
or	O
serial	O
killers	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
for	O
people	O
like	O
noriega	O
and	O
such	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
operating	O
on	O
a	O
more	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
causing	O
massive	O
problems	O
in	O
society	O
up	O
here	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
in	O
our	O
power	O
to	O
take	O
these	O
people	O
from	O
a	O
sovereign	O
state	O
and	O
say	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
deserve	O
to	O
live	O
because	O
they	O
're	O
feeding	O
our	O
consumer	O
needs	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
is	O
very	O
curious	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

i	O
guess	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
recording	O
started	O
now	O

i	O
served	O

i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
force	O
and	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
court	O
martial	O
board	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
similar	O
to	O
a	O
jury	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
rules	O
apply	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
one	O

was	O
it	O
civil	O
or	O
criminal	O

a	O
grand	O
jury	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
see	O

um-hum	O

did	BE_IP
did	C
the	O
judge	O
hand	O
down	O
sentences	O

did	O
you	O
folks	O
do	O
that	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
science	O
in	O
itself	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
see	O

i	O
guess	O
you	O
'd	O
probably	O
be	O
a	O
too	O
puritanical	O

um-hum	O

so	O
where	BE_IP
where	C
the	O
sentences	O
that	O
the	O

handed	O
out	O
what	O
you	O
thought	O
to	O
be	O
fair	O

if	BE
you	IE

do	C
you	C

that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
different	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

wow	O

i	O
bet	O
that	O
made	O
him	O
happy	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

how	O
many	O
members	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O

six	O
or	O
twelve	O
member	O
jury	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
curious	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
realize	O
until	O
the	O
william	O
kennedy	O
smith	O
trial	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
ago	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
six	O

i	O

that	O
they	BE_IP
you	C

it	C
was	O
always	O
twelve	BE_IP
twelve	C
men	O
tried	O
and	O
true	O
so	O
to	O

but	O
apparently	O
for	O
some	BE_IP
some	C
crimes	O
it	O
's	O
permissible	O
to	O
have	O
six	O
people	O
sitting	O
judgment	O

i	O
know	O

getting	O
to	O
this	O
unanimous	O
thing	O
whether	O
you	O

jury	O
should	O
be	O
unanimous	O
or	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
court	O

case	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
require	O
the	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
simple	O
majority	O
you	O

rules	O

probably	O
on	O
capital	O

we	BE
were	IE
n't	IP
we	C

the	O
two	O
that	O
are	O
on	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
drugs	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
unanimous	O
in	O
acquitting	O
the	O
person	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
in	BE
our	IP
in	C
our	C
gut	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O
individuals	O
were	O
both	O
guilty	O
just	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
friends	O
because	O
of	O
various	O
things	O

the	O
government	O
really	O
failed	O
to	O
prove	O
its	O
case	O

you	O
know	O
being	O
fair	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
if	O
the	O

does	O
n't	O
prove	O
its	O

no	O
matter	O
how	O
you	O
feel	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
by	O
what	O
's	O
offered	O
as	O
proof	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
acquit	O
him	O
in	O
both	O
cases	O

uh-huh	O
yeah	O

it	O
was	O
yeah	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
critical	O
things	O
like	O
the	O
off	O
special	O
investigations	O
at	O
one	O
time	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
cases	O
had	O
videotaped	O
this	O
person	O

but	O
something	O
happened	O
to	O
the	O
camera	O
and	O
the	O
tape	O
and	O
all	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
was	O
testify	O
about	O

yeah	O

so	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O

so	O
i	O
finally	O
served	O
on	O
one	O
last	O
year	O

been	O
voting	O
for	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
figure	O
out	O
why	O
i	O
had	O
n't	O
been	O
called	O
yet	O
and	O
i	O
finally	O
was	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
interesting	O
experience	O

it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
boring	O

it	BE
was	IP
it	C_IE
was	C_IP
well	C
let	C
's	C
see	C
i	C
was	C
municipal	O
court	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
pool	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
criminal	O
on	O
several	O

and	O
they	O
had	O

well	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
spent	O
sitting	O
around	O
in	O
the	O
jury	O
room	O
and	O
getting	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
other	O
potential	O
jurors	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
always	O
exciting	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
called	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
go	O
because	O
when	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
else	O
besides	O
just	O
sit	O
in	O
the	O
jury	O

yeah	O

the	O
judge	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
had	O
a	O
hard	O
time	O
getting	O
seated	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O

kept	O
getting	O

questioned	O
for	O
impaneling	O
the	O
jury	O

they	O
kept	O
dismissing	O
me	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
reason	O

but	O
just	O
whether	O
the	O

the	O

feels	O

they	O
want	O
to	O

the	O

they	O
all	O

yeah	O

well	O
they	O
kept	O
getting	O

up	O
for	O

question	O

and	O
i	O

part	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
they	BE
did	IE
n't	IP
they	C
did	C
n't	C
like	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
drink	O
anymore	O

yeah	O

that	O
was	O
probably	O

although	O
in	O
my	O
case	O
i	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
sympathetic	O
with	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
got	O
caught	O

i	O
was	O
never	BE_IP
never	C_IP
never	C
there	O
for	O
any	O
sentencing	O

i	O
finally	O
got	O
impaneled	O
on	O
one	O
case	O
on	O
my	O
next	O
to	O
the	O
west	O

and	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
jury	O
room	O
to	O
decide	O
the	O
case	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
one	O
guy	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O
who	O
announced	O
everybody	O
that	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
deliberate	O
because	O
he	O
'd	O
already	O
decided	O
that	O
the	O
guy	O
was	O
not	O
guilty	O

and	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
vote	O
for	O
guilty	O

so	O
are	O
they	O
plenty	O
me	O
jury	O
jury	O
foreman	O

and	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
going	O
in	O
without	O
deliberating	O
allowed	O
us	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O
verdict	O

so	O
i	O
told	O
the	O
judge	O
that	O
we	BE
were	IE
n't	IP
we	C
're	C
unable	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O
verdict	O
because	O
we	O
could	O
n't	O
get	O
one	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
jury	O
to	O
deliberate	O

so	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
tried	O
over	O
again	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	BE
was	IP
it	C
was	C
funny	O

the	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE_IP
i	IE

n't	IP
i	C
did	C
n't	C
like	O
not	O
being	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
wanted	O
to	O
vote	O
guilty	O
for	O
the	O
guy	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
people	O
were	O
kind	O
of	O
mixed	O
so	O
where	O
the	O
guy	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O
all	O
over	O
again	O

cost	O
him	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

it	O
must	O

six	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

it	O

drug	O

i	O
've	O

just	O
like	O
marijuana	O
or	O
cocaine	O

that	O
's	O
interesting	O

what	O
type	O
of	O

and	O
we	O
work	O
are	O
around	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
explosives	O

yeah	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
'm	O
all	O
for	O
it	O
because	O
the	BE_IP
well	C
the	C
type	O
of	O
environment	O
i	O
work	O
in	O
you	O
know	O
where	O
they	O
're	O
working	O
with	O

so	O
they	O
could	O
blow	O
up	O
the	O
whole	O

they	O
have	O
safety	O
features	O
with	O
each	O
of	O
the	O

they	O

but	O
still	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
dangerous	O

yeah	O

now	O
do	O
they	O
fire	O
them	O
or	O
do	O
they	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
wow	O

our	O
policy	O
is	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
sure	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
they	O
do	O
have	O
counseling	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
second	O
chance	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	BE_IP
if	C_IE
it	C_IE
's	C_IP
if	C
you	C
get	O
caught	O
or	O
if	O
you	O
turn	O
yourself	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
works	O
very	O
good	O
with	O
that	O
random	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
limits	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

good	O
time	O
it	O
just	O
right	O

i	O
've	O
met	O
one	O
employee	O

and	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
working	O
with	O
the	O
alcohol	O
is	O
bred	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
our	O
policy	O
covers	O
that	O
or	O
not	O

that	O
'd	O
be	O
just	O
as	O
dangerous	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

uh-huh	O

do	O
they	O
give	O
any	O
limits	O
on	O
alcohol	O

uh-huh	O

pretty	O
good	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
drug	O
testing	O
in	O
the	O
workplace	O

we	O
have	O
random	O
drug	O
testing	O
in	O
my	O
business	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
never	BE
been	IP
never	C
had	C
to	O
do	O
it	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

they	O
started	O
that	O
about	O
a	O
year	O
ago	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
for	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
field	O
people	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
drive	O
trucks	O
and	O
heavy	O
machinery	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

but	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
have	O
done	O
some	O
testing	O
around	O
our	O
office	O
mostly	O
after	O
lunch	O
looking	O
for	O
people	O
drinking	O
drinking	O
beer	O
and	O
stuff	O
at	O
lunch	O
time	O

pardon	O

yeah	O

they	BE
'll	IP
they	C
'll	C
check	O
for	O
alcohol	O

yeah	O

once	BE_IP
once	C
you	O
start	O
doing	O
this	O
stuff	O
you	BE
're	IE
sort	IE
of	IP
you	C
sort	C
of	C
stuck	O
into	O
check	O
them	O
for	O
the	BE
whole	IP
the	C
whole	C
thing	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
in	O
the	O
oil	O
business	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
office	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	BE_IP
pretty	C
safe	O
environment	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
sounds	O
like	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
important	O
job	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
straight	O
on	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
agree	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
under	O
certain	O
circumstances	O
especially	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
working	O
in	O
a	O
high	O
risk	O
industries	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
really	O
hurt	O
other	O
people	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
abused	O
you	O
know	O
random	O
you	O
know	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
's	O
random	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
the	O
individual	O
's	O
rights	O
are	BE_IP
are	C
protected	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
that	O
big	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
it	O

well	O

this	O
is	O
where	O
i	O
start	O
have	O
my	O
problem	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
my	O
car	O

i	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
private	O
company	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
policy	O
is	O
something	O
like	O
if	O
i	O
can	O
restate	O
this	O
correctly	O
now	O
if	O
you	O
turn	O
yourself	O
in	O
as	O
having	O
a	O
drug	O
related	O
problem	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
eligible	O
for	O
a	O
company	O
counseling	O

but	O
if	O
they	O
catch	O
you	O
if	O
you	O
test	O
positive	O
for	O
controlled	O
substance	O
then	O
you	O
get	O
fired	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
always	O
catch-22	O

yeah	O

really	O

it	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
read	O
one	O

and	O
then	O
if	BE
you	IP
if	C
you	C
're	C
not	O
worried	O
about	O
who	O
just	O
forget	O
about	O
it	O

yeah	O

our	O
company	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
tougher	O
on	O
a	O
second	O
chance	O

i	O
mean	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
turn	O
yourself	O
in	O
than	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
think	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
to	O
help	O
to	O
get	O
you	O
get	O
your	O
rehabilitated	O
to	O
go	O
to	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
to	C
get	O
back	O
at	O
your	O
job	O

but	O
when	BE
you	IE
're	IE
not	IP
when	C
you	C
're	C
a	O
private	O
company	O
the	O
rules	O
do	O
n't	O
always	O
apply	O

well	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
hard	O
for	O
me	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
evaluate	O
it	O
because	O
everybody	O
i	O
work	O
around	O
is	O
in	O
an	O
office	O
environment	O

you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
not	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
run	O
into	O
anybody	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
had	O
a	O
problem	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
been	O
a	O
problem	O

so	O
i	BE
get	IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
guess	C
it	O
works	O
much	O
like	O
well	O
she	O
was	O
like	O
anyway	O

i	O
mean	O
everybody	O
's	O
got	O
an	O
equal	O
chance	O
to	O
get	O
picked	O

so	O
i	O
'd	O
rather	O
have	O
that	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
say	O
well	O
this	O
week	O
the	O
a	O
's	O
and	O
these	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
in	O

next	BE
week	IP
season	C
days	C

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

yeah	O

especially	O
around	O
you	O
know	O
equipment	O
machinery	O
and	O
stuff	O

oh	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
gone	O
out	O
and	O
had	BE
a	IP
had	C
a	C
beer	O
at	O

not	O

in	O
any	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
remember	O

i	O

they	O

well	O
they	O
must	O

gee	O

that	O
just	O
shows	O
how	O

i	O

i	BE_IP
i	C

i	O
do	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
can	O
take	O
some	O
of	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
testing	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
too	O
far	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
company	O
in	O
houston	O
that	O

they	O
did	O
an	O
unannounced	O
drug	O
sweep	O
of	BE
the	IP
of	C
their	C

or	O
was	O
it	BE
was	IP
it	C
was	C
unannounced	O
sweep	O
of	O

not	O
only	O
drugs	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
basically	O
agree	O
that	O

do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
okay	O
for	O
a	O
company	O
to	O
reject	O
somebody	O
just	O
knowing	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
take	O
drugs	O

i	O
mean	O
suppose	O
they	O
found	O
out	O
some	O
other	O
way	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
were	O
drug	O

yeah	O

once	O
too	O

so	O

yeah	O

hi	O
during	O
a	O
job	O
interview	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
dumb	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
at	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
trying	O
to	O
convince	O
me	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
want	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
this	O

just	O
like	O
well	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
even	O
going	O
to	O
think	O
much	O
about	O
it	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
gonna	O
treat	O
me	O
with	O
this	O
much	O

even	O
before	O
you	O
've	O
gotten	O
to	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

oh	O
like	O
you	O
say	O
i	O
mean	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
critical	O
kind	O
of	O
job	O
where	O
someone	O
could	O
get	O

then	O
really	O
what	O
people	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
i	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

you	O

you	O

your	O

if	O
you	O
are	O
doing	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
causing	O
a	O

then	O
they	O
'll	O
notice	O
it	O
for	O
other	O
reasons	O

yeah	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
illegal	O
for	O
an	O

to	O

this	O

i	O

oh	O
really	O

well	O
that	O
sounds	O
fun	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
had	O
a	O
real	O
challenge	O
of	O
planning	O
a	O
family	O
reunion	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
ago	O

and	O
they	O
were	O

we	O
sent	O
out	O
five	O
hundred	O
announcements	O
because	O
our	O
family	O
is	O
quite	O
large	O
like	O
your	BE_IP
your	C
family	O
there	O

so	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
real	O
challenge	O

i	O
was	O
president	O
of	O
our	O
family	O
reunion	O
for	O
two	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
n't	O
very	O
appreciated	O
that	O
duty	O
for	O
two	O
years	O
in	O
a	O
row	O

but	O
i	O
found	O
that	O
advance	O
planning	O
was	O
the	O
key	O
to	O
some	O
extent	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
well	O
that	O
was	O
wonderful	O
though	O

oh	O

oh	O
well	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
helpful	O

our	O
family	O
ranges	O
from	O
oh	O
goodness	O
well	O
australia	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
brother	O
lives	O
in	O
australia	O
to	O
boise	O
idaho	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
places	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
boy	O

oh	O
gosh	O

they	O
must	O
really	O
like	O
it	O
there	O

yeah	O

oh	O

oh	O
you	O
're	O
ready	O
to	O
move	O
on	O

okay	O

i	O
'm	O
bill	O
from	O
raleigh	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
another	O
one	O
from	O
a	O
different	O
state	O
besides	O
texas	O

right	O

yes	O

i	O
was	O
n't	O
really	O
planning	O
one	O

kind	O
of	O
i	O
was	O
a	O
birthday	O
and	O
i	O
brought	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
family	O
together	O
then	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
pretty	O
good	O

i	O
've	O
worked	O
in	O
hotels	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O

i	O
used	O
to	O

usually	O
when	O
we	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
our	O
family	O
reunions	O
as	O
my	O
grandmother	O
's	O
birthday	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
of	O
like	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
comes	O
from	O
a	O
big	O
family	O

she	O
has	O
like	O
seven	O
sisters	O
i	O
think	O

and	O
they	O
show	O
up	O
and	O
all	O
their	O
kids	O

she	O
has	O

i	O
have	O
like	O

has	O
four	O
sons	O
and	O
two	O
daughters	O

and	O
they	O
show	O
up	O
and	O
all	O
their	O
kids	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
big	O
reunion	O

that	O
's	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
people	O
maybe	O

the	BE_IP
probably	C
the	C
biggest	O
challenge	O
was	BE_IP
it	C
was	C
getting	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
everyone	O
you	O
know	O
could	O
eat	O
comfortably	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
everything	O

i	O
guess	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O
helpful	O
thing	O
was	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
rent	O
the	BE_IP
we	O
rented	O
like	O
a	O
rescue	O
squad	O
building	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
each	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
everybody	O
that	O
showed	O
up	O
donated	O
some	O
money	O
for	O
the	O
rent	O
and	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
like	O
soft	O
drinks	O

and	O
so	O
nobody	O
like	O
really	O
got	O
stuck	O
with	O
the	O
bill	O

each	O
person	O
in	O
the	O
family	O
you	O
know	O
brought	O
a	O
dish	O
or	O
some	O

it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
potluck	O

you	O
know	O
everybody	O
brought	O
their	O
specialties	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
would	O
say	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
my	O
grandmother	O
's	O
food	O
was	BE_IP
it	C
was	C
always	O
gone	O
first	O
because	O
she	O
's	O
such	O
a	O
great	O

she	O
's	O
eighty	O
six	O

yeah	O

probably	O
like	O
she	O
's	O
in	O
her	O
early	O
sixties	O
and	O
she	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
arthritis	O
she	O
'd	O
get	O
around	O
better	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O

yeah	O

my	O
nickname	O
for	O
hunting	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
call	O
or	O

and	O
i	O
'll	O
say	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
's	O
helpful	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
your	O
family	O
spread	O
out	O
or	O
whatever	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
all	O
my	O
family	O
lives	O
like	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
county	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
telephone	O

so	BE_IP
and	C
such	O
days	O
some	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
date	O
and	O
everybody	O
shows	O
up	O

i	O
would	O
say	O
you	O
're	O
spread	O
out	O

my	BE_IP
my	C
immediate	O
family	O
on	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
parents	O
and	O
my	O
brothers	O
and	O
stuff	O
but	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
have	O
the	O
gypsy	O
blood	O
or	O
whatever	O

because	O
my	O
dad	O
was	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
're	O
pretty	O
strung	O
out	O
all	O
over	O

but	O
since	O
i	O
moved	O
back	O
to	O
carolina	O
we	O
still	O
are	O
the	O
only	O
ones	O
do	O
not	O
living	O
in	O
anson	O
county	O

i	O
live	O
in	O
raleigh	O

my	BE_IP
my	C
parents	O
live	O
in	O
greenville	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
one	O
brother	O
and	O
his	O
wife	O
live	O
in	O
greenville	O
and	O
another	O
brother	O
that	O
lives	O
and	O
outside	O

so	O
i	O
mean	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
spread	O
out	O

but	O
everybody	O
else	O
is	O

in	BE_IP

they	O

well	O

there	O

only	O
a	BE_IP
a	C

and	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

starting	O

i	O
nineteen	O
ninety	O
three	O
well	O
not	O

but	O
there	BE
's	IP
you	C

's	C
a	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
got	O
me	O
very	O
can	O
you	O

that	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
quite	O
a	O

before	O
we	O

this	O

yeah	O
that	O
could	O
spawn	O
several	O
good	O

us	O
out	O

so	O
i	O

is	O
in	O
a	BE

of	IP
somewhat	C
of	C
a	C

the	BE_IP

there	O
is	O
a	O

how	O

a	O

you	O

then	O
how	O

oh	O

oh	O
my	O

well	O
i	BE

oh	C
i	C
'd	C

quite	O
a	O

of	O
camping	O
mostly	O
with	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O

we	O
have	O
five	O
children	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
camping	O
with	O
the	O
little	O
ones	O
is	O
n't	O
as	O
enjoyable	O
is	O
just	O
when	O
we	O
go	O
ourselves	O

so	O
we	O
've	O
tried	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
once	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
go	O
on	O
a	O
anniversary	O
camp	O
out	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
gone	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
mountains	O
and	O
not	O
necessarily	O
roughed	O
it	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
just	O
found	O
it	O
just	O
real	O
enjoyable	O
to	O
be	O
alone	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O

and	O
then	O
the	BE
boys	IE
are	IP
our	C
boys	C
are	C
old	O
enough	O
now	O

twelve	O
any	O
level	O

and	O
so	O
they	O
're	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
scouting	O

they	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
camping	O
with	O
the	O
scouts	O
and	O
last	O
year	O
my	O
one	O
twelve	O
year	O
old	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
scout	O
camp	O
for	O
a	O

so	O
this	O
year	O
they	O
'll	O
both	O
be	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
been	O

for	O
them	O

yes	O

well	O

no	O

actually	O
they	BE

there	O
over	O

and	O
i	O

they	O
've	O
taken	O
the	O

last	O
year	O
they	O
camped	O
in	O

and	O
this	O
year	O
i	O
believe	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
in	O

also	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

oh	O
is	O
that	O
right	O

oh	O
and	O
what	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

when	BE
we	IP
when	C

quite	O
a	O

well	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
do	O
a	O

when	O
we	O
go	O

and	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
also	O
carry	O
all	O
our	O

with	O
us	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
canoe	O
down	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
sleep	O
on	BE
the	IE
river	IP
on	C
one	C
of	C
the	C

and	O
then	O
get	O
up	O
the	O
next	O

cook	O
our	O

and	O
go	O
down	O
the	O

again	O

how	O
about	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

um-hum	O

what	BE_IP
what	C
kind	O
of	O

do	O
they	O
like	O

do	O
they	O

it	O
where	O
they	O
have	O

and	O
do	O
they	O
cook	O
on	O

uh-huh	O
uh-huh	O

course	O
i	O
imagine	O
it	O
gets	O
cold	O
in	O
parts	O
of	O
utah	O

does	O
n't	O
get	O
very	O
cold	O
in	O
texas	O

so	O
lots	O
of	O
times	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
take	O
tents	O

we	O
just	O
use	O
trail	O
tarps	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
material	O
that	BE
has	IP
that	C
has	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
places	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
tie	O
off	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
tent	O
like	O
a	O

they	O
're	O
very	O
light	O
weight	O

we	O
use	O
them	O
when	O
we	O
go	O
backpacking	O

so	O
we	O
go	O
backpacking	O
fifteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
miles	O
then	O

they	O
're	O
not	O
very	O
heavy	O
see	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
carry	O
them	O
with	O
you	O

they	O
'll	O
keep	O
you	O
dry	O
or	O
whatever	O

um-hum	O

yes	O

in	O
fact	O
last	O
month	O
we	O
went	O
camping	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
deer	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
just	O
deer	O
everywhere	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
it	BE_IP
even	C
though	C
it	C
was	O
n't	O
hunting	O
season	O

and	O
we	O
're	O
with	O

so	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
when	O
i	O
go	O
hunting	O

but	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
deer	O
out	O
and	O
about	O

of	O
course	O
we	O
see	O
smaller	O
animals	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

one	O
thing	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
big	O
concern	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
at	O
night	O
is	O
make	O
sure	O
the	BE_IP
all	C
the	C
foods	O
put	O
away	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
armadillos	O

armadillo	O
is	O

and	O
possums	O
and	O
raccoons	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
those	O

down	O
here	O
that	O
they	BE
like	IE
to	IP
they	C
like	C
to	C
go	O
hunting	O
for	O
midnight	O

and	O
so	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IP
that	C
can	O
be	O
a	O
problem	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
put	O
all	O
your	O

away	O

they	O
will	O
if	O
you	O
take	O
them	O

but	O
most	O
time	O
they	O
run	O

from	O
you	O
if	BE_IP
if	C_IE
they	C_IP
if	C
they	C

you	BE

you	C

they	C

uh-huh	O

i	O
can	O

this	O

basically	O
i	O

in	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

we	O

i	O

what	O

oh	O

that	O

here	O
you	O

that	O

maybe	O

two	O

it	O

if	O
you	O

it	O

you	BE

you	C
're	C
kind	C
of	O
luck	O

it	BE

it	C
was	C
interesting	O

i	O
think	O
you	O

right	O

i	O
think	O
health	O

is	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O
pressing	O
the	O
pressing	O
one	O

but	O
i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
mind	O
having	O
dental	O
you	O
know	O

sometimes	O
dental	O
costs	O
can	O
be	O
just	O
about	O
as	O
expensive	O
if	O
not	O
more	O

and	O
i	O
know	O
historically	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
companies	O
i	O
think	O
carried	O
dental	O
as	O
a	O
rider	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
medical	O
but	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
widely	O
followed	O
anymore	O

sure	O

how	O
does	O
university	O
of	O
new	O
hampshire	O

is	BE
that	IP
let	C
me	C
interrupt	O
is	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
for	O
both	O
professors	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
also	O
staff	O
and	O
administration	O

generally	O
across	O
the	O
board	O
do	O
you	O
think	O

okay	O

i	O
'm	O
kind	O
of	O
interested	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
actually	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
route	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
when	O
i	O
finally	O
get	O
my	O
degree	O
is	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
teaching	O
university	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
doctoral	O
student	O
in	O
florida	O
right	O
now	O
but	O

that	O
's	O
interesting	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
is	O
and	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
benefits	O
they	BE
would	IP
it	C
would	C
cover	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

oh	O
is	O
that	O
right	O

yeah	O

i	O
work	O
for	O
the	O
university	O
of	O
new	O
hampshire	O

and	O
our	O
benefits	O
package	O
is	BE
n't	IP
is	C
n't	C
quite	O
as	O
good	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
some	O
ways	O

overall	O
i	O
'm	O
satisfied	O
with	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
the	O
vision	O
care	O

have	O
the	O
health	O
care	O
and	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
medical	O
the	O
dental	O

yeah	O

i	O
work	O
and	O
i	O
'm	O
in	BE
the	IP
on	C
the	C
professional	O
administrative	O
and	O
technical	O
staff	O

so	O
the	BE_IP
the	C_IP
the	C
benefits	O

probably	O
the	O
main	O
thing	O
i	O
like	O
about	O
the	O
benefits	O
is	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
very	O
generous	O
vacation	O
time	O
and	O
sick	O
time	O

we	BE
get	IP
we	C
get	C
fifteen	O
days	O
a	O
year	O
sick	O
time	O

and	O
we	O
get	O
twenty	O
four	O
days	O
a	O
year	O
right	O
from	O
the	O
day	O
when	BE_IP
when	C
you	O
start	O
working	O
get	O
twenty	O
four	O
days	O
a	O
year	O
time	O
off	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
health	O
care	O
of	O
course	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
an	O
important	O
in	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
single	O
most	O
important	O
benefit	O
and	O
the	O
rates	O
that	O
we	O
keep	O
paying	O
seem	O
to	O
keep	O
increasing	O
you	O
know	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	O
little	O
disturbed	O
about	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
national	O
trend	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
solution	O
is	O
to	O

it	O
's	O
bigger	O
than	O
just	O
the	O
benefits	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

well	O
we	O
have	O
two	O
different	O
plans	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
subscribe	O
to	O
under	O
dental	O
depending	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
cost	O
between	O
them	O
is	O
very	O
very	O
little	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
cost	O
me	O
something	O
like	O
five	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
for	O
the	O
dental	O
plan	O

but	O
it	O
pays	O
a	O
substantial	O
amount	O

the	O
examinations	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
checkups	O
every	O
year	O
or	O
every	O
six	O
months	O
of	O
free	O
and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
covers	O
the	O
bulk	O
of	O
the	O
dental	O
expenses	O

yes	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
benefits	O
plan	O
is	O
different	O
for	O
operating	O
for	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
operating	O
staff	O
which	O
are	O
considered	O
to	O
be	O
clerical	O
personnel	O
accountants	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
as	O
opposed	O
to	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
the	O
p	O
a	O
t	O
staff	O
which	O
i	O
belong	O
to	O
it	O
but	O
the	O
meat	O

i	O
think	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
health	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
dental	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
for	O
everybody	O
and	O
the	O
retirement	O
plan	O

the	O
main	O
differences	O
in	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
way	O
sick	O
time	O
is	O
accrued	O
and	O
vacation	O
time	O
is	O
accrued	O

for	O
the	O
operating	O
staff	O
it	O
's	O
on	O
a	O
seniority	O
it	O
's	O
you	O
know	O
based	O
on	O
how	O
long	O
they	O
work	O
there	O

that	O
determines	O
how	O
much	O
vacation	O
time	O

uh-huh	O

college	O
programs	O
belong	O
to	O
this	O
t	O
i	O
a	O
sierra	O
if	O
retirement	O
fund	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
the	O
university	O
of	O
new	O
hampshire	O

your	O
first	O

um-hum	O

okay	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
differences	O
i	O
see	O
is	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
university	O
there	O
is	O
room	O
for	O
advancement	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
quite	O
a	O
highly	O
unionized	O
environment	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
in	O
administrative	O
association	O

so	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
progressive	O
path	O

but	O
not	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
say	O
the	O
commercial	O
sector	O
the	O
motivation	O
is	O
n't	O
there	O
for	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
like	O
really	O

yeah	O

somewhat	O
that	O

but	O
then	O
also	O
there	O
just	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
have	O
a	O
broader	O
scope	O
for	O
rewarding	O
people	O
for	O
their	O
performances	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
our	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
're	O
dealing	O
with	O
an	O
institution	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
difficult	O
to	O
recognize	O
an	O
individual	O
's	O
performance	O
and	O
i	O
suppose	O
that	O
's	O
maybe	O
a	O
disadvantage	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
larger	O
institution	O
perhaps	O
somewhat	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
business	O

but	O
i	O
agree	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
medical	O
benefits	O
and	O
those	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O
are	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
big	O
pluses	O
for	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
organization	O
and	O
also	O
the	O
security	O
aspect	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
term	O
employment	O

job	O
security	O

yes	O

yeah	O

we	O
're	O
seeing	O
that	O
here	O
as	O
well	O

in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
oil	O
companies	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
massive	O
layoffs	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
there	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
major	O
distinction	O
between	O
institutions	O
and	O
the	O
corporate	O
world	O
and	O
institutions	O
are	O
slower	O
to	O
react	O
both	O
on	O
the	O
growth	O
side	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
on	O
the	O
reduction	O
side	O
where	O
the	O
businesses	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
cut	O
back	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
we	O
do	O

but	O

yeah	O

and	O
institutionally	O
like	O
here	O
at	O
the	O
university	O
oh	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
cutback	O
well	O
gee	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
where	O
it	O
necessarily	O
is	O
needed	O

that	O
's	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
most	O
expedient	O
which	O
well	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
for	O
us	O
it	BE
's	IP
where	C
it	C
makes	O
the	O
least	O
noise	O
which	O
means	O
it	O
's	O
often	O
the	O
lowest	O
support	O
type	O
roles	O

so	O

it	O
's	O
very	O
easy	O

yeah	O

because	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
support	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
providing	O
the	O
speed	O
for	O
it	O

well	O
the	O

that	O
's	O
maybe	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
importance	O
i	O
guess	O

because	O
my	O
perspective	O
is	O
from	O
an	O
institution	O

the	BE_IP
there	C
's	C
not	O
much	O
incentive	O
for	O
innovativeness	O
because	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
limitation	O
for	O
reward	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
very	O
severe	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
the	O
corporate	O
world	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
is	O
considerable	O
motivation	O
for	BE_IP
i	C
guess	C
in	C
innovation	O

although	O
he	O
's	O
the	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
the	C
more	O
complex	O
your	O
structure	O
the	O
less	O
difficult	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
carry	O
some	O
things	O
through	O
but	O
i	O
think	O
there	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
long	O
term	O
type	O
of	O
process	O
where	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
organization	O
it	O
's	O
things	O
can	O
happen	O
much	O
more	O
quickly	O

so	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
the	O
reward	O
of	O
your	O
efforts	O

right	O

you	O
end	O
up	O
being	O
your	O
own	O
person	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
job	O
fine	O
and	O
if	O
somebody	O
else	O
is	O
messing	O
it	O
up	O
well	O
then	O
that	O
's	O
their	O
problem	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
really	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
becomes	O
the	O
organization	O
instead	O
of	O
person	O
being	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
individual	O
themselves	O

oh	O
okay	O

i	O
was	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
say	O
i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
things	O
for	O
me	O
is	O
like	O
room	O
for	O
advancement	O
you	O
know	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
in	BE_IP
like	C
in	C
a	O
dead	O
end	O
job	O

and	BE_IP
plus	C
for	O
me	O
it	O
's	O
i	O
mean	O
like	O
medical	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
benefits	O
and	O
dental	O

they	O
're	O
also	O
important	O

um-hum	O

are	O
they	O
like	O
pretty	O
much	O
trained	O
for	O
a	O
specific	O
job	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
hired	O
for	O
and	O
then	O
i	O
just	O
very	O
little	O
variation	O
from	O
there	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O

because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
's	O
necessarily	O
the	O
case	O
anymore	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
after	O

you	O
mean	O
security	O
job	O
security	O

that	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
i	O
think	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
so	O
much	O
anymore	O

in	O
fact	O
they	O
would	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
lay	O
off	O
in	O
what	O
november	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
necessarily	O

i	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
some	O
people	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
doubt	O
yeah	O

exactly	O

where	O
the	O
most	O
dollar	O
what	O
i	O
wear	O
it	O
you	O
know	O

oh	O

oh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
too	O

too	O
many	O
management	O
people	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
easy	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
say	O
oh	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
when	O
they	O
really	O
are	O
n't	O
aware	O
of	O
what	O
all	O
it	O
took	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
work	O
done	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
wonder	O
why	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O

oh	O
those	O
people	O
are	O
n't	O
there	O
anymore	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

but	O

so	O
what	O
else	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
is	O
important	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
think	O
probably	O
in	O
a	O
small	O

yeah	O

i	BE
was	IE
gonna	IE
say	IE
more	IP
it	C
's	C
more	C
personal	C
for	O
one	O
thing	O

you	O
probably	O
have	O
a	O
better	O
team	O
cooperation	O
or	O
team	O
playing	O
atmosphere	O

probably	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
bigger	O
corporation	O
sometimes	O
you	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
just	O
a	O
number	O
you	O
know	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

whereas	BE_IP
yeah	C
in	C
a	O
smaller	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
'd	O
be	O
more	O
willing	O
to	O
either	O
help	O
that	O
person	O
or	O
help	O
it	O
get	O
accomplished	O
you	O
know	O

um-hum	O

well	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
swayed	O
more	O
criminal	O
or	O
civil	O
suits	O

so	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
i	O
mean	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
stereotypical	O
bleeding	O
heart	O
juries	O
where	O
they	O
feel	O
sorry	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
really	O
bothers	O
me	O
about	O
that	O
is	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
a	O
judge	O
can	O
be	O

but	O
i	O
like	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O

you	BE_IP
you	C_IP
you	C

more	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
you	O

more	O

you	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
definitely	O
a	O
problem	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
definitely	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O

but	O
since	O

well	O
what	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
about	O
sentence	O
juries	O
doing	O
the	O
sentencing	O
in	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
becomes	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O

the	O
same	O
crime	O
gets	O
unequal	O
sentences	O

yeah	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
there	O
's	O
more	O
of	O
an	O
ability	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
know	O
selecting	O
a	O
jury	O
two	O
different	O
juries	O
that	O
would	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
idea	O
the	O
same	O
idea	O
versus	O
you	O
know	O
whether	O
he	O
is	O
guilty	O
or	O
innocent	O
but	O
i	BE
think	IP
i	C
think	C
that	O
there	O
is	O
that	O
there	O
'd	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
variation	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
trying	O
to	O
gauge	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
severity	O
of	O
the	O
crime	O
and	O
an	O
appropriate	O
punishment	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
have	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
measure	O
stick	O
across	O
the	O
board	O

of	O
course	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
's	O
also	O
the	O
ability	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O
defendant	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
lawyer	O

yeah	O

oh	O

i	O
agree	O

you	O
know	O
admit	O
to	O
you	O
that	O
they	BE
can	IP
they	C
do	C
n't	C
have	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
letting	O
allowing	O
themselves	O
to	O
believe	O
their	O
client	O
innocent	O
guilty	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
how	O
do	O
they	O
convince	O
the	O

or	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O

off	O
the	O

one	O
thing	O
that	BE

there	BE
this	IE

that	C

sense	O

i	O
feel	O
very	O
uncomfortable	O
with	O
trials	O
by	O
juries	O
recently	O

and	O
that	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
they	O
're	O
swayed	O
more	O
by	O
emotion	O
than	O
by	O

i	O

um-hum	O

that	O
's	O
a	O

i	O
would	O

with	O

um-hum	O

my	O
question	O
i	O
guess	O
is	BE_IP
are	C
they	O
really	O
your	O
peers	O

too	O
often	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
and	O
when	BE
you	IP
when	C
you	C
were	O
selecting	O
a	O
jury	O
and	O
you	O
're	O
doing	O
it	O
partially	O
if	O
not	O
entirely	O
on	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
which	O

you	O

you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
concern	O
too	O
me	O
too	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
in	O
such	O
cases	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
really	O
looking	O
for	O
unbiased	O
people	O
but	O
rather	O
for	O
biased	O

now	O
i	O
happen	O
to	O
know	O
several	O
judges	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
one	O
that	O
i	O
'd	O
feel	O
uncomfortable	O
about	O
have	O
matt	O
doing	O
sentencing	O
without	O
the	O
jury	O

i	O
feel	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
uneasy	O
about	O
but	O
the	O

two	O
i	O
feel	O
would	O
give	O
either	O
you	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

or	O
the	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
full	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
'm	O
concerned	O

um-hum	O

this	O
is	O
very	O
true	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
see	O
such	O
uneven	O
sentencing	O
you	O
know	O
evidence	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
newspapers	O
and	O
such	O
i	O
mean	O
where	O
it	O
would	O
appear	O
that	O
the	O
crimes	O
were	O
very	O
similar	O

but	O
one	O
individual	O
got	O
twenty	O
five	O
years	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
one	O
was	O
sentenced	O
to	O
life	O

so	O

oh	O

is	O
n't	O
that	O
the	O
truth	O

there	O
are	O
times	O
when	O
is	O
it	O
oh	O
goodness	O
my	O
mind	O
is	O
gone	O
blank	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
he	O
says	O
kill	O
all	O
the	O
lawyers	O

every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
one	O
is	O
tempted	O
to	O
feel	O
that	O
way	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
taken	O
me	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
lawyers	O
are	O
concerned	O
with	O
the	O
law	O
and	O
not	O
with	O
justice	O
as	O
we	O
think	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
am	O
as	O
novices	O
tend	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
attorneys	O
care	O
about	O
justice	O

um-hum	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
effective	O
too	O

even	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
involved	O
in	O
it	O
just	O
slightly	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
where	O
i	O
know	O
the	O
person	O
is	O
guilty	O
but	O
his	O
attorneys	O
gotten	O
him	O
off	O

city	O
has	O
dropped	O
their	O
charges	O
against	O
him	O
because	O
they	BE
're	IP
the	C
attorney	C
has	C
presented	C
enough	O
evidence	O
of	O
doubt	O
to	O
convince	O
the	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

well	O
jackie	O
on	O
taxes	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
guess	O
i	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
i	BE_IP
my	C
opinion	C
is	C
that	C
i	C
do	C
think	C
that	C
americans	O
are	O
paying	O
too	O
much	O
in	O
taxes	O

what	O
's	O
your	O
feeling	O
about	O
that	O

where	O
you	O
live	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
state	O
income	O
tax	O
in	O
a	O
sales	O
tax	O
both	O

uh-huh	O

in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
no	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
broad	O
base	O
taxes	O

no	O
income	O
tax	O
and	O
no	O
sales	O
tax	O

we	O
tax	O
business	O
eight	O
percent	O

businesses	O
are	O
taxed	O
eight	O
percent	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
the	O
five	O
bees	O
for	O
our	O
taxes	O
booze	O
butts	O

beds	O
a	O
hotel	O
room	O
tax	O
bellies	O
a	O

and	O

so	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
low	O
tax	O
rate	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
combined	O
with	O
the	O
federal	O
income	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
americans	O
generally	O
do	O
painting	O
too	O
much	O
in	O
taxes	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
nice	O

nice	O
to	O
get	O
a	O

uh-huh	O

do	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
for	O
whatever	O
taxes	O
we	O
do	O
pay	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
getting	O
value	O
for	O

yeah	O

my	BE_IP
my	C
opinion	O
of	O
taxes	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
you	O
send	O
money	O
to	O
washington	O
or	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
they	O

you	O

around	O

for	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
of	O

ten	O

after	C
you	C

who	O

in	O
your	O

and	O
that	O
would	O

a	O

i	O
'm	O

they	O

fight	O

i	O
really	O

a	O

would	O
be	O
a	O
lot	O
fairer	O
for	O
all	O
americans	O

i	O

it	O
does	O
n't	O
seem	O
right	O
that	O
somebody	O
that	O
makes	O
twenty	O
five	O
or	O
thirty	O
thousand	O
dollars	O
pays	O
four	O
or	O
five	O

somebody	O

i	O

your	O

the	BE_IP
probably	C
the	C

a	BE_IP
a	C
mutt	O

well	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
named	O
it	O
hooper	O
because	O
that	O
's	O
where	O
we	O

it	O
from	O

some	O

she	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O

drop	O
off	O
abandoned	O
abandoned	O

at	O
our	O
house	O
and	O
she	O
used	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
it	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
veterinarian	O

so	O
she	O
would	O
spay	O
neuter	BE
them	IP
give	C
them	C
all	O
their	O

we	O
saw	O
an	O
ad	O

it	O
was	O

so	O
we	O
went	O
down	O
there	O
and	O
picked	O
it	O
up	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
an	O

oh	O
i	O

you	BE_IP
you	C_IP
you	C

um-hum	O

when	O
it	O
happened	O
like	O
a	O
cafeteria	O
or	O
something	O

well	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	O

should	O
be	O
outlawed	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O

i	O
mean	O
how	O
easy	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
get	O

and	O
then	O
like	O
with	O
a	O
step	O
with	O
that	O
massacre	O
in	O
killeen	O
texas	O
not	O
too	O
long	O
ago	O
but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
i	O
mean	O
unless	O
they	O
do	O
i	O
just	O
outlaw	O
them	O
how	O
you	O
can	O
i	O
mean	O
prevent	O
that	O

yeah	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
even	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
procedures	O
are	O
now	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
gun	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
gun	O
especially	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O
that	O

that	O
's	O
pretty	O
scary	O

so	O
did	BE_IP
now	C
do	C
they	O
want	O
us	O
to	O
say	O
where	O
we	O
feel	O
about	O
it	O
like	O
in	O
writing	O
at	O
one	O
to	O
ten	O

that	O
's	O
where	O
i	O
'd	O
probably	O
be	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
what	BE
they	IE
can	IP
how	C
they	C
can	C
really	O
enforce	O
the	O
laws	O
any	O
better	O
because	O
i	O

i	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
need	O
them	O
and	O
like	O
for	O
protection	O
and	O
stuff	O
and	O
i	O
can	O
understand	O
the	O
money	O
now	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
like	O
say	O
all	O
those	O

go	O
out	O
and	O
practice	O
with	O
it	O
enough	O
to	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
with	O
it	O
so	O
i	O
finally	O
ended	O
up	O
giving	O
it	O

i	O
do	O

i	BE_IP

to	O

turn	O
it	O

well	O
the	O
way	O
they	BE

you	O

we	O
had	O
what	O
we	O
called	O
tree	O

that	O
's	O
just	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
them	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
recycled	O

and	O
a	O
half	O
by	O

and	O
you	O
set	O
it	O
by	O

you	O

you	O

it	O

you	O

so	O

right	O

right	O

but	O
somebody	O
still	O
has	O
to	O
collect	O
all	O
that	O
and	O
bundle	O
it	O

whereas	O
if	O
you	O

a	O

you	O

the	O

it	O
's	O
already	O
bundled	O

it	O
's	O
already	O

for	O
you	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
saving	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
effort	O

i	O
just	O
need	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
paper	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
recommended	O
to	O
somebody	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
feasible	O

so	O
what	O
else	O
do	O
they	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
dallas	O
area	O

uh-huh	O

anything	O
extra	O

that	O
sounds	O
good	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
been	O
wanting	O
to	O
put	O
like	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
bins	O
like	O
right	O
out	O
my	O
garage	O
door	O
you	O
know	O
from	O
the	O
kitchen	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
can	O
throw	O
cans	O
in	O
one	O
or	O
the	O
glass	O
and	O
the	O
other	O

the	O
even	O

areas	O
that	O
can	O
recycle	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
tin	O
cans	O
like	O
you	O
're	O
you	O
know	O
vegetables	O
things	O
come	O
in	O

so	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
not	O
done	O
that	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
what	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
so	O
because	O
we	O
do	O
go	O
through	O
aluminum	O
cans	O
you	O
know	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
the	O
one	O
we	O
use	O
most	O

but	O

find	O
a	O
place	O

well	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
do	O
have	O
facilities	O
for	O
recycling	O
the	O
newspapers	O
aluminum	O
cans	O

those	O
are	O
the	O
two	O
major	O
items	O

now	O
we	O
can	O
take	O
oil	O
like	O
car	O
oil	O
recycled	O
oil	O
too	O

they	O
have	O
dump	O
areas	O
like	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
departments	O
throughout	O
town	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
yet	O
have	O
the	O
facilities	O
here	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
tin	O
cans	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
the	BE
plastics	IP
like	C
the	C
liter	C
bottles	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
know	O
for	O
sure	O
though	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
newspaper	O
and	O
the	O
aluminum	O
can	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
oil	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
departments	O

so	O

i	O
think	O
people	O
are	O
becoming	O
more	O
aware	O
you	O
know	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O
waste	O

you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
like	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
know	O

you	O
drive	O
through	O
burger	O
king	O
now	O

and	O
the	O
banks	O
are	O
recycled	O
paper	O
and	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
so	C
you	O
know	O
i	O
feel	O
like	O
people	O
are	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O
are	O
becoming	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
like	O
maybe	O
it	O
's	O
making	O
an	O
impact	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
about	O
searching	O
something	O
out	O
like	O
that	O
but	O
if	O
i	O
'm	O
there	O
and	O
the	O
choices	O
there	O
i	O
would	O
probably	O
take	O
the	O
recycled	O
product	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
where	O
i	O
probably	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
responsible	O
as	O
a	O
citizen	O
wise	O
you	O
know	O
looking	O
or	O
searching	O
those	O
out	O
because	O
you	O
figure	O
if	O
we	O
as	O
citizens	O
do	O
that	O
then	O
the	O
manufacturers	O
and	O
producers	O
will	O
start	O
packaging	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
getting	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
star	O

right	BE_IP
what	C
type	O
of	O
budget	O
do	O
you	O
or	O
your	O
family	O
have	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
sounds	O
like	O
probably	O
a	O
tighter	O
controlled	O
budget	O
and	O
then	O
i	O
have	O

i	O
'm	O
single	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
excuse	O
for	O
not	O
having	O
a	O
tight	O
budget	O

but	O
i	O
basically	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O

i	O
'm	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
track	O
of	O

so	O
it	O
makes	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
easier	O

and	O
also	O
i	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
try	O
to	O
save	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
each	O
month	O
as	O
well	O
and	O
i	O
kind	BE
of	IP
kind	C
of	C
have	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
what	O
my	O
expenses	O
are	O

i	O
'm	O
pretty	O
consistent	O
from	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
and	O
whenever	O
i	O
need	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
whenever	O
that	O
changes	O
i	O
'm	O
pretty	O
well	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O
without	O
actually	O

to	O

a	O

for	O
it	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
do	O
a	O
similar	O
thing	O
more	O
medium	O
or	O
longer	O

i	O
just	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
maybe	C
a	C
target	O
amount	O
that	O
i	O
'll	O
save	O

probably	O
within	O
a	O
year	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O

a	O

so	O
i	O
kind	O

have	O
an	O
amount	O
in	O
my	O

i	O
'm	O
making	O
every	O

to	BE_IP
to	C
solve	O
put	O
a	O
little	O

and	O
you	O

increase	O
the	O
amount	O
i	O
need	O
for	O
a	O
down	O

or	O
whatever	O

right	O

right	O

have	O
you	O
thought	O
about	O
leasing	O

uh-huh	O

if	O
you	O
're	O
rolling	O
over	O
every	O
three	O
years	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
advantageous	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
typically	O
you	BE_IP
if	C
you	C
purchase	O
your	O
own	O
car	O
you	O
tend	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
returns	O
after	O
you	O

it	O
off	O

of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
longer	O
you	O
keep	O
it	O
beyond	O
that	O
point	O
the	O
more	O
profitable	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
own	O
it	O
yourself	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

yeah	O

a	O
month	O
seven	O
years	O
old	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
last	O
year	O
was	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
rough	O
year	O
for	O

a	O
number	O
of	O
expenses	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
hoping	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O

yeah	O

did	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
number	O
of	O
miles	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
everything	O
replaced	O
brake	O
shocks	O
and	O
all	O
that	O

so	O
i	O
would	O
just	O
went	O
through	O
that	O
whole	O
set	O
last	O
year	O

i	O
'm	O
hoping	O
i	O
'll	O
have	O
a	O
slow	O
period	O
before	O
i	O

that	O
again	O

a	O

are	O
you	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
we	O
really	O

a	O

i	O
have	O
a	O

that	BE

that	C
i	C

actually	O
well	O
actually	O
there	O
is	O
a	O

we	O

our	O

apparently	O

my	O

you	C

to	O

with	O

uh-huh	O

you	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

um-hum	O

right	O

oh	O
i	O
found	O
that	O
you	O

thing	O
as	BE_IP
as	C
i	O
've	O
gotten	O
older	O

in	O
my	O

before	O
we	O

a	O
very	O
strict	O

four	O
kids	O

you	O

we	BE_IP
we	C

out	O
how	O

we	O

for	O

for	BE_IP
for	C
this	O

for	O
that	O

kind	O
of	O
anticipate	O
how	O
much	O
things	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

i	O
guess	O
one	O
interesting	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
budgeting	O
i	O
do	O
now	O
is	O
that	O
i	O
set	O
aside	O
like	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
fence	O
off	O
areas	O
of	O
my	O
checkbook	O

for	O
instance	O
there	O
are	O
certain	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
know	O
come	O
up	O
every	O
so	O
often	O

every	O
six	O
months	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
car	O
insurance	O

every	O
six	O
months	O
had	O
to	O
pay	O
my	O
taxes	O

so	O
i	O
take	O
a	O
set	O
amount	O

i	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
money	O
market	O
account	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
saving	O
in	O

and	O
also	O
got	O
a	O
checking	O
account	O
besides	O
that	O

but	O
what	O
i	O
do	O
a	O
money	O
market	O
account	O
for	O
my	O
taxes	O
for	O
instance	O
which	O
amount	O
an	O
average	O
of	O
two	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
i	O
'll	O
just	O
take	O
two	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty	O

and	O
i	O
put	O
it	O
in	O

they	O
take	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
right	O
line	O
total	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
parenthesis	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
let	O
it	O
build	O
up	O

every	O
month	O
i	O
add	O
two	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty	O
dollars	O

and	O
then	O
when	O
the	O
tax	O
bill	O
comes	O
in	O
i	O
've	O
got	O
that	O
much	O
set	O
aside	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
budgeting	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

cars	O
are	O
definitely	O
something	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
figure	O
into	O
your	O
budget	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
buying	O
them	O
but	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
keeping	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
too	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
two	O
cars	O

my	O
wife	O
has	O
a	O
car	O

and	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
drive	O
a	O
pick	O
up	O
truck	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
on	O
a	O
schedule	O
where	O
i	O
try	O
every	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
years	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
buy	O
a	O
new	O
one	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
'm	O
constantly	O
making	O
car	O
payments	O

but	O
i	O
figure	O
that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
anyway	O
making	O

payments	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
get	O
one	O
paid	O
for	O

actually	O
i	O
'm	O
saving	O
up	O
for	O
another	O
one	O

so	O
it	BE
's	IP
you	C_IE

it	C_IE
's	C_IP
it	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
a	O
never	O

you	O

those	O
things	O
so	O
that	O
you	BE
're	IP
you	C
're	C
not	O

at	O
the	O

i	O

what	O
i	O
'm	O

well	O
i	O
've	O
thought	O
about	O
it	O

but	O
leasing	O

n't	O

you	O

i	O

it	O
for	O
my	O

my	O

just	O
for	O

to	O

only	O
ten	O

twelve	O

i	O

that	O
after	O
about	O
four	O

they	O
kind	O

and	O
you	O

to	O
put	BE_IP
put	C
stuff	O
into	O
them	O
you	O

uh-huh	O

when	C

and	O
you	O
know	O
both	O
areas	O
are	O
pretty	O
crime	O
ridden	O
right	O
now	O
and	O
it	BE
's	IE
just	IP
you	C_IP
you	C
never	C
know	C
who	C
's	C
out	O
there	O

for	O
self	O
protection	O
purposes	O

and	O
then	O
of	O
course	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
hunting	O

so	O

that	O
's	O
good	O

but	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
researcher	O
at	O
honeywell	O
up	O
here	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

you	O
guys	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
hunt	O
or	O
anything	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
that	O
's	O
something	O
i	O
miss	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

yeah	O

my	O
brother	O
was	O
a	O
guide	O
for	O
bear	O
and	O
elk	O
hunts	O
out	O
in	O
idaho	O
for	O
awhile	O
and	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
it	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
guess	O
what	O
's	O
the	O
scale	O
now	O
it	O
's	O
zero	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
a	O
complete	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
'm	O
about	O
eight	O
or	O
nine	O

yeah	O

no	O
doubt	O
about	O
it	O

but	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

if	BE
there	IE
's	IP
if	C
there	C
is	O
a	O
way	O
you	O
know	O
too	O
limited	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
people	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
guess	O
they	O
passed	O
a	O
couple	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
laws	O
here	O
awhile	O
back	O
in	O
some	O
states	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
a	O
waiting	O
period	O
where	O
they	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
you	C
go	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
hand	O
gun	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
actually	O

i	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
this	O
way	O
in	O
florida	O

they	O
have	O
a	O
waiting	O
period	O
where	O
you	O
buy	O
one	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
check	O
you	O
out	O
and	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
record	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
idea	O

and	O
that	O
's	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
bad	O
idea	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
you	O
can	O
always	O
get	O
around	O
that	O

through	O
the	O
black	O
market	O
and	O
like	O
you	O
say	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
always	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
around	O

yeah	O

one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE
guess	IP
i	C
guess	C
some	O
forms	O
of	O
guns	O
should	O
probably	O
be	O
control	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
sure	O
why	O
anybody	O
would	O
need	O
a	O
fully	O
automatic	O
weapon	O

i	O
'm	O
just	O
not	O

i	O
think	O
those	O
have	O
been	O
pretty	O
much	O
you	O
know	O
banned	O
altogether	O
anyway	O

it	O
kind	O
of	O
takes	O
the	O
sport	O
out	O
of	O

you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
what	O

you	O
do	O
with	O
that	O
that	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
do	O
you	O

with	O

a	O
seven	O

twenty	O

you	O

you	O
might	O

the	O

and	O
so	O
it	O
's	O

i	O

i	BE_IP
it	C_IP
it	C

it	O

yeah	O
i	BE_IP

i	BE_IP
i	C

i	O

it	O
's	O
more	O
of	O
a	O

you	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

i	O

it	O

you	O

kind	O
of	O
rainy	O
actually	O

around	O

of	O
the	O
printed	O
media	O

i	O
know	O
of	O
cases	O
where	O
for	O
example	O
and	O
television	O
media	O
where	O
they	O
'll	O
show	O
clippings	O
from	O
one	O
event	O
describe	O
another	O
event	O
but	O
with	O
the	O
attempt	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
showing	O
you	O
which	O
is	O
sort	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
deliberate	O
by	O
which	BE
is	IP
which	C
is	C
really	O
disturbing	O

you	O
know	O
a	O
b	O
c	O
does	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
access	O
either	O
although	O
i	O
did	O
at	O
one	O
time	O

i	O
did	O
during	O
the	O
gulf	O
war	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
addictive	O

yeah	O

well	O
during	O
that	O
small	O
sample	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
everyone	O
was	O
just	BE
about	IP
just	C
about	C
the	O
same	O
except	O
the	O
three	O
networks	O
also	O
had	O
regular	O
television	O
programming	O

so	O
at	O
that	O
particular	O
time	O
you	O
wanted	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
latest	O
and	O
greatest	O
news	O
you	O
could	O
do	O
that	O
by	BE
turning	IP
on	C
c	C
n	O
n	O

eric	O

are	O
you	O
married	O

oh	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
family	O

okay	O

and	O
do	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
wife	O
has	O
a	O
budget	O
plan	O
for	O
your	O
finances	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
basically	O
what	O
we	O
do	O

about	O
every	BE_IP
every	C
three	O
months	O
or	O
so	O
we	O
reevaluate	O
our	O
budget	O

and	O
we	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
just	O
right	O
from	O
the	O
largest	O
bills	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
smallest	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
divvy	O
them	O
up	O
between	O
our	O
four	O
pay	O
checks	O

i	O
work	O
part	O
time	O
at	O
night	O
and	O
he	O
works	O
and	O
my	O
husband	O
works	O
full-time	O
days	O

so	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
four	O
pay	O
checks	O

but	O
it	O
works	O
out	O
nice	O
because	O
we	O
get	O
paid	O
every	O
week	O

and	O
so	O
that	O
does	O
help	O

yeah	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
extra	O
for	O
extra	O
spending	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
well	O
earmarked	O

every	O
penny	O
is	O
earmarked	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
works	O
the	O
best	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
so	C
if	O
we	O
can	O
just	O
divide	O
them	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
major	O
bills	O
up	O

in	O
fact	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
easier	O
to	O
divide	O
the	O
major	O
bills	O
up	O
you	O
know	O
cut	O
the	O
house	O
payment	O
in	O
half	O
and	O
cut	O
the	O
loan	O
payment	O
in	O
half	O

and	O
divide	O
those	O
up	O
between	O

um-hum	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
not	O
taking	O
a	O
huge	O
sum	O
out	O
of	O
one	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
next	O
paycheck	O
were	O
real	O
short	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

it	O
helps	O
it	O
to	O
focus	O
where	O
your	O
money	O
goes	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
you	O
felt	O
the	BE
same	IP
the	C
same	C
frustration	O
before	O
you	O
got	O
on	O
a	O
budget	O

but	O
you	O
're	O
wondering	O
my	O
when	O
you	O
put	O
down	O
all	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
bring	O

and	O
you	O
're	O
saying	O
my	O
word	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
funny	O

does	O
it	O
go	O

and	O
also	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
write	O
down	O

and	O
we	O
did	O
this	O

we	O
're	O
not	O
real	O
consistent	O
with	O
this	O

but	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
month	O

and	O
we	O
wrote	O
down	O
everything	O
that	O
we	O
bought	O
with	O
you	O
know	O
every	O
paycheck	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
where	O
every	O
penny	O
went	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
just	O
what	O
you	O
do	O
spend	O

and	O
like	O
i	O
say	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
real	O
consistent	O
with	O
it	O

should	O
because	O
it	O
does	O
help	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

stick	O
to	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
sounds	O
like	O
a	O
really	O
good	O
idea	O

really	O
helpful	O

have	O
you	O
developed	O
a	O
savings	O
plan	O
or	O
i	O
r	O
a's	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O
yeah	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
feeling	O

my	O
husband	O
just	O
graduated	O
from	O
the	O
university	O
a	O
year	O
ago	O
so	O
finally	O
finally	O
getting	O
to	O
that	O
point	O
too	O

so	O
are	O
you	O
still	O
going	O
to	O
school	O

oh	O
yes	O
i	O
am	O
too	O
both	O
questions	O

yeah	O

we	O

basically	O
there	O
is	O
the	O
you	O
know	O
expenses	O
that	O
are	O
fixed	O
during	O
the	BE
month	IP
you	C
know	C
the	C
ones	C
that	O
come	O
every	BE_IP
every	C
month	O

and	O
we	O
enter	O
those	O
into	BE_IP
into	C
a	O
spreadsheet	O

and	O
what	O
's	O
ever	O
left	O
after	O
that	O
we	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
we	C_IP
we	C
sit	O
down	O
and	O
agree	O
on	O
kind	O
of	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
sort	O
of	O
range	O
we	O
're	O
gonna	O
generally	O
gonna	O
shoot	O
for	O

so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O

um-hum	O

wow	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

oh	O
allocated	O
out	O

yeah	O

all	O
the	O
checks	O

and	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
definitely	O
helped	O
get	O
a	O
handle	O
on	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
unnecessary	O
expenses	O

we	BE
were	IE
before	IP
we	C
started	C
doing	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
thing	O
we	O
were	O
spending	O
money	O
for	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

probably	O
tended	O
to	O
eat	O
out	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
than	BE_IP
than	C
we	O
should	O
have	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
let	O
things	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
hand	O

but	O
it	BE
's	IE
brought	IP
it	C
to	C
be	C
really	C
helpful	O

it	O
's	O
gotten	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
loans	O
paid	O
off	O
early	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

the	BE
other	IP
the	C
other	C
thing	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
we	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
helps	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
tend	O
to	O
fudge	O
on	O
the	O
budget	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
the	O
money	O
in	O
advance	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
unreasonably	O
high	O
but	O
for	O
things	O
like	O
food	O
expenses	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
whatever	O
just	O
put	O
it	O
in	BE
a	IP
in	C
an	C
envelope	O
or	O
whatever	O

and	O
that	O
way	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
forced	O
us	O
to	O
stick	O
to	O
that	O
amount	O
and	O
then	O
once	O
that	O
was	O
gone	O
well	O
if	O
the	O
entertainment	O
amount	O
was	O
gone	O
for	O
the	O
month	O
so	O
it	O
's	O
gone	O

oh	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
have	O
n't	O

our	BE_IP
our	C
initial	O

was	O
just	O
to	O

completely	O
retire	O
our	O

for	O

and	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
all	O
of	O
that	O

we	O
're	O
just	O
at	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
we	O
can	O
start	O

about	O
it	O

so	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
i	O
'm	O
actually	O
in	BE
the	IP

they	O
've	O
been	O
touring	O
since	O
late	O
sixties	O

yeah	O

they	O
're	O
still	O
together	O

they	O
're	O
still	O
making	O
albums	O

yeah	O
in	O
fact	O
i	O
mean	O
there	O
are	O
people	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
basically	O
just	O
follow	O
them	O
around	O
from	O
city	O
to	O
city	O
on	O
tour	O
selling	O
tie	O
dyes	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

yeah	O

they	O
're	O
like	O
late	O
forties	O
early	O
fifties	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
whenever	BE
the	IP
one	C
of	C
them	C
dies	O
off	O
they	O
get	O
a	O
replacement	O

yeah	O
yeah	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
really	O
bad	O
time	O
with	O
keyboard	O
players	O

they	O
keep	O
on	O
dying	O

and	O
they	O
keep	O
it	O
in	O
replacing	O
them	O

the	O
new	O
ones	O
in	O
the	O
thirties	O
you	O
know	O

but	O

well	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
actually	O
look	O
at	O
is	O
rough	O
is	O
the	O
rolling	O
stones	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
saw	O
the	O
tour	O
posters	O
for	O
the	O
rolling	O
stones	O
when	O
they	O
last	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
it	O
looked	O
like	O
leather	O
day	O
at	O
the	O
geriatric	O

faces	O
were	O
just	O
all	O
shriveled	O

um-hum	O

i	O
mean	O
just	BE_IP
just	C
looked	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
got	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
retirees	O
and	O
put	O
him	O
in	O
leather	O
jackets	O
and	O
blue	O
jeans	O

yeah	O
i	O
prefer	O
my	O
performers	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
sober	O
you	O
know	O
just	BE_IP
just	C
so	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
're	O
jamming	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
just	O
lose	O
themselves	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
go	O
into	O
la	O
land	O

so	O
have	O
you	O
seen	O
any	O
concerts	O
lately	O

lots	O
of	O
different	O
kinds	O
i	O
guess	O

i	O
like	O
country	O
music	O
course	O
texas	O

and	O
i	O
listen	O
to	O
christian	O
music	O
a	O
lot	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
christian	O
music	O
station	O
here	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
our	O
city	O
and	O

so	O
i	O
listen	O
to	O
it	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

and	O
i	O
'll	O

friday	O
night	O
and	O
saturday	O
night	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
christian	O

they	O
have	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
music	O

they	O
just	O

the	O
other	O
day	O
i	O
attended	O
a	O
conference	O
here	O
in	O
utah	O
state	O
university	O
on	O
recycling	O
and	O
i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interested	O
to	O
here	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
people	O
from	O
the	O
e	O
p	O
a	O
and	O
lots	O
of	O
different	O
places	O
and	O
they	O
basically	O
decided	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
real	O
problem	O
here	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
on	O
solid	O
waste	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
too	O

oh	O
they	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
propose	O
any	O
solutions	O

actually	O
they	BE
were	IP
the	C
guy	C
was	C
pretty	O
negative	O
about	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
was	O
doing	O
even	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
from	O
the	O
e	O
p	O
a	O

but	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
facts	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
give	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
how	O
many	O
solid	O
waste	O
plants	O
were	O
being	O
shut	O
down	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
things	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
was	O
recycling	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
newsprint	O

he	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
new	O
york	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
went	O
collected	O
all	O
this	O
news	O
print	O
and	O
they	O
could	O
sell	O
it	O
for	O
awhile	O

able	O
to	O
sell	O
it	O
for	O
so	O
many	O

now	O
at	O
this	O
stage	O
of	O
the	O
game	O
where	O
they	O
've	O
gotten	O
into	O
recycling	O
they	O
've	O
collected	O
so	O
much	O
news	O
print	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
hauled	O
away	O

we	O
're	O
doing	O
some	O
here	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
cash	O
valley	O
the	O
community	O
here	O

there	BE
's	IP
you	C
've	C
actually	O
got	O
kind	O
of	O
nice	O
setup	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
plants	O
here	O
that	O
actually	O
take	O
recycled	O
paper	O
and	O
shred	O
it	O
and	O
spray	O
it	O
with	O
chemical	O
treatment	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
fire	O
hazard	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
into	O
insulation	O

and	O
they	O
can	O
actually	O
use	O
as	O
much	O
recycled	O
paper	O
as	O
the	O
community	O
can	O
get	O
to	O
them	O
because	O
they	O
're	O
actually	O
buying	O
and	O
shipping	O
it	O
in	O
from	O
outside	O

so	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
real	O
keys	O
it	O
sounds	O
like	O
a	O
getting	O
recycling	O
of	O
paper	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
to	O
go	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
business	O
to	O
actually	O
want	O
it	O
and	O
once	O
you	O
've	O
collected	O
it	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
paper	O
presented	O
this	O
conference	O
from	O
a	O
guy	O
from	O
alabama	O

and	O
he	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
study	O
by	O
two	O
departments	O
for	O
the	O
government	O

one	O
of	O
those	O
like	O
environmental	O
protection	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
one	O
was	O
oh	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
remember	O
what	O

but	O
the	O
basic	O
idea	O
there	O
was	O
presented	O
to	O
him	O
was	O
how	O
can	O
we	O
maximize	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
energy	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
get	O
back	O
from	O
recycling	O
and	O
minimize	O
the	O
volume	O
of	O
stuff	O
we	O
're	O
putting	O
into	O
our	O
landfill	O
and	O
the	O
solution	O
that	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
for	O
plastics	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
fun	O

well	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
plastics	O
is	O
to	O
burn	O
them	O

came	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
plastics	O
is	O
actually	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
problems	O
in	O
landfills	O
cause	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
low	O
weight	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
high	O
volume	O
so	O
it	O
takes	O
up	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
space	O
and	O
there	BE
's	IE
almost	IE
no	IE
energy	IP
there	C
's	C
very	C
little	C
energy	O
value	O
and	O
actually	O
doing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
recycling	O

but	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
energy	O
in	O
it	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
burn	O
it	O
and	O
use	O
it	O
produce	O
electricity	O

so	O
his	O
solution	O
was	O
to	O
burn	O
plastic	O
collect	O
it	O
and	O
burn	O
it	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
than	O
even	O
paper	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

per	O
pound	O
or	O
whatever	O

well	O
that	BE
was	IP
he	C
did	C
n't	C
deal	O
with	O
that	O

just	O
said	O

talk	O
about	O
cleaning	O
it	O
up	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
very	O
practical	O

yeah	O

well	O

not	O
too	O
much	O

i	O
got	O
a	O
bit	O

hello	O
chuck	O

um-hum	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
new	O
revelation	O

right	O

so	O
what	BE_IP
what	IE
are	IE
the	IP
is	C
the	C
e	O
p	O
a	O
recommending	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

hi	O

that	BE
's	IE
a	IP
that	C
's	C
a	C
common	O
problem	O
though	O

it	O
seems	O
that	O
has	O
happened	O
in	O
dallas	O

and	O
i	O
try	O
to	O
recycle	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
newspapers	O
that	O
come	O
to	O
my	O
house	O

and	O
after	O
a	O
while	O
i	O
just	O
quit	O
taking	O
the	O
newspaper	O
because	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
recycle	O
it	O
anymore	O
which	O
is	O
good	O
for	O
business	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
either	O
i	O
suppose	O

um-hum	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

there	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
reuse	O
for	O
it	O

i	O
mean	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
they	O
recycle	O

i	O
think	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
recycled	O
bottles	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
the	O
industry	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
with	O
the	O
recycled	O
polymers	O
everything	O
from	O
waste	O
baskets	O
to	O

to	O
the	BE
no	IE
stick	IP
i	C
mean	C
the	C
sticky	C
slide	C
rugs	O
under	O
the	O
carpet	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
even	O
putting	O
it	O
in	O
the	O

these	O
days	O

and	O
they	O

that	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
really	O

right	O

oh	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
carbon	O

so	O
that	O

well	O
what	O
about	O
emissions	O

oh	O

okay	O

no	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

that	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
day	O
at	O

thirty	O

and	O
then	O
working	O
up	O
to	O
you	O

a	O
high	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
gradually	O
go	O
down	O
again	O

i	O
only	O
do	O
it	O
probably	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
a	O

the	O

then	O
you	O

i	O

i	O
go	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

i	O
could	O

well	O
here	O
in	O

the	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

we	O
're	O
in	O
a	O

of	O
about	O
a	O

and	O
eighty	O

people	O

there	O
are	O
areas	O
where	O
we	O

actually	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
the	O
handicapped	O

type	O
of	O
places	O
where	O
the	O
one	O
they	O
do	O
is	O
just	O
as	O
a	O
recycling	O
operation	O
and	O
then	O
others	O
they	O
collect	O
the	O
paper	O
and	O
ship	O
it	O
to	O
other	O

we	O
're	O

drop	O
off	O

and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

and	O
then	O
there	BE
are	IP
there	C
is	C
a	O

program	O
on	O
plastic	O
and	O
glass	O
containers	O
well	O
primarily	O
soft	O

bottles	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
're	O
able	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
rehabilitation	O
centers	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
recycle	O
the	O
containers	O

they	O
refund	O
the	O
deposit	O
which	O
is	O
anywhere	O
from	O
five	O
to	O
fifteen	O
cents	O
a	O
container	O

right	O

yeah	O
on	BE
the	IP
on	C_IE
primarily	C_IP
on	C
soft	C
drink	C
pop	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
induce	O
recycling	O
of	O
plastic	O
and	O
glass	O
soft	O
drink	O
containers	O

we	O
do	O
have	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
scrap	O
metal	O
dealers	O
that	O
will	O
accept	O
tin	O
and	O
aluminum	O
cans	O
as	O
well	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
actually	O
the	O
recycler	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
deposit	O
on	O
aluminum	O
pop	O
cans	O
and	O
beer	O
cans	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
recycler	O
with	O
the	O
handicapped	O
group	O
will	O
also	O
accept	O
though	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
fairly	O
fairly	O
extensive	O

but	O
again	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
the	O
initiative	O
of	O
the	O
individual	O
person	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
coordinated	O
pick	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
city	O

well	O
actually	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
the	O
opportunity	O
for	O
both	O

generally	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
handicapped	O
group	O
takes	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O

actually	O
the	O
government	O
has	O
placed	O
a	O
deposit	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
inducement	O
to	O
read	O
recycle	O
the	O
bottle	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
your	O
money	O
back	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
recycler	O
run	O
by	O
the	O
handicapped	O
society	O
pays	O
back	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
that	O
deposit	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
in	O
turn	O
will	O
get	O
some	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
bottlers	O
and	O
from	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
people	O
that	O
do	O
the	O
canning	O
of	O
the	O
pop	O
and	O
the	O
beer	O
as	O
well	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
partly	O
because	O
of	O
our	O
climate	O

here	O
in	O
saskatoon	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
central	O

well	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
central	O
canada	O

but	O
central	O
canada	O
tends	O
to	O
be	O
referred	O
more	O
to	O
ontario	O
and	O
quebec	O
but	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
call	O
them	O
homeless	O
people	O

we	O
certainly	O
have	O
a	O
fair	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
on	O
welfor	O
welfare	O
and	O
unemployment	O
insurance	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

there	O
's	O
psychological	O
pressure	O
against	O
employing	O
people	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
although	O
scouts	O
and	O

teams	O
and	O
ball	O
teams	O
those	O
kinds	O
regularly	O
do	O
bottle	O

where	O
they	O

around	O

and	O
collecting	O
the	O

at	O
individual	O

they	O
have	O

it	O
some	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
actually	O
quite	O
an	O
extensive	O
network	O
of	O
collecting	O
newspapers	O

actually	O
it	O
virtually	O
all	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

there	O
are	O
several	O

can	O

then	O
the	O

some	O

they	BE

they	C

here	O

ooh	O
actually	O
this	O
is	O
my	O
first	O
experience	O

program	O

but	O
instead	O

just	O

okay	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
heard	O
about	O
it	O
a	O
similar	O
program	O
in	O
new	O

city	O
where	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
called	O

homeless	O

or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
they	O
employee	O
homeless	O
i	O
think	O
mostly	O
men	O
but	O
homeless	O
people	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
collect	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
recyclable	O
cans	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
cans	O

bottles	O
as	O
well	O
but	O
like	O
beer	O
cans	O
soda	O
cans	O
and	O
whatnot	O

and	O
they	O
bring	O
them	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
one	O
low	O
one	O
centralized	O
location	O
and	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
collect	O
the	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
various	O
beer	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
soda	O
manufacturers	O
and	BE_IP
and	C_IP
and	C
get	O
more	O
money	O
to	O
these	O
people	O
that	O
desperately	O
need	O
it	O

yeah	O

do	O
they	O
do	O
it	O
with	O
newspapers	O
as	O
well	O

the	O
question	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
trying	O
to	O
put	O
together	O
a	O
long-term	O
financial	O
planning	O
a	O
monthly	O
budget	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
do	O
now	O
is	O
put	O
the	O
data	O
into	O
quicken	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
familiar	O
with	O
that	O

i	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
reliable	O
way	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
check	O
book	O
balanced	O
actually	O
because	O
what	O
will	O
happen	O
is	O
my	O
wife	O
or	O
i	O
'll	O
write	O
a	O
few	O
checks	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
'll	O
not	O
bother	O
to	O
total	O
it	O
comes	O
comes	O
from	O
just	O
to	O
do	O
all	O
the	O
arithmetic	O

and	O
it	O
helps	O
with	O
that	O

actually	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
to	O
until	O
just	O
recently	O

i	O
guess	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
daughter	O
who	O
's	O
eighteen	O
months	O
and	O
another	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
way	O

so	O
you	O
just	O
start	O
doing	O
more	O
of	O
that	O
just	BE
for	IP
you	C
know	C
saving	C
for	C
college	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

try	BE
to	IP
try	C
to	C
put	O
away	O
between	O
two	O
and	O
four	O
thousand	O
a	O
year	O
just	O
for	O
that	O

um-hum	O

sounds	O
good	O

i	O
guess	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
just	O
at	O
the	O
point	O

my	O
wife	O
works	O
until	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
family	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
now	O
we	O
're	O
just	O
going	O
in	O
the	O
one	O
income	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
interesting	O
trying	O
to	O

find	O
some	O
extra	O
i	O
think	O
payroll	O
deductions	O
probably	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
we	O
'll	O
be	O
able	O
to	O

you	O
know	O
kind	O
of	O
forced	O
savings	O

i	O
would	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O

that	O
sounds	O
good	O

yeah	O
yeah	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
curious	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

oh	O
okay	O

cincinnati	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
wondering	O
if	O
they	O
'd	O
be	O
collecting	O
people	O
with	O
the	O
western	O
accents	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
many	O
people	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
involved	O
in	O
this	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

actually	O
i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interested	O
if	O
you	O
found	O
out	O
about	O
the	O
study	O
by	O
reading	O
telecom	O
digest	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

that	O
's	O
how	O
i	O
got	O
it	O
as	O
well	O

but	O

i	O
'll	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
'd	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
data	O
base	O

oh	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
the	O
experiment	O

probably	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
topic	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
finances	O
without	BE_IP
without	C
getting	O
to	O
a	O
dollar	O
figures	O
i	O
guess	O

i	O
can	O
talk	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
range	O
goals	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
either	O
my	O

or	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
pursue	O
advanced	O
degrees	O
at	O

that	O
in	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
we	O
're	O
not	O
working	O
for	O

that	O

to	O

seems	O

every	O

my	O

back	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
little	O

of	O
their	O
tuition	O

and	O
these	O
to	O

at	O
a	O

no	O
it	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
reimbursement	O
depending	O
on	O
the	O
grade	O
you	O
get	O
in	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
real	O
shift	O
from	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
before	O

yeah	O

have	O
some	O
friends	O
of	O
mine	O
who	O
use	O
quicken	O

and	O
i	O
considered	O
using	O
at	O

i	O
decided	O
that	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O

be	O
a	O

of	O
time	O
keeping	O
that	O
up	O
to	O
date	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
gave	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
using	O
quicken	O
at	O
least	O
for	O
now	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
similar	O
problems	O

but	O
we	O
just	O
have	O
the	O
one	O
checkbook	O

and	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
date	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O

and	O
occasionally	O
we	O
'll	O
get	O
behind	O
like	O
you	O
say	O

but	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
too	O
too	O
tight	O
if	O
we	O
're	O
just	O
remember	O
to	O
keep	O
everything	O
up	O
up-to-date	O
and	O
balance	O

well	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
handle	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
long	O
range	O
or	O
medium	O
range	O
planning	O
on	O
finances	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O

yeah	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
daughter	O
who	O
's	O
ten	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
put	O
much	O
away	O
for	O
her	O
college	O
up	O
to	O
this	O
point	O

but	O
we	O
're	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
now	O
where	O
our	O
financial	O
income	O
is	O
enough	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
consider	O
putting	O
some	O
away	O
for	O
college	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
starting	O
a	O
regular	O
payroll	O
deduction	O
in	O
the	O
fall	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
i	O
'll	O
be	O
making	O
this	O
summer	O
we	O
'll	O
be	O
putting	O
away	O
for	O
college	O
fund	O

our	O
situation	O
is	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
opposite	O
of	O
that	O
because	O
my	O
wife	O
was	O
not	O
working	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
and	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
school	O
and	O
just	O
recently	O
took	O
on	O
a	O
full-time	O
job	O
well	O
almost	O
full	O
time	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
only	O
recently	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
the	O
money	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
start	O
putting	O
away	O
large	O
sums	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
range	O
goals	O
like	O

and	O
he	O

so	O
i	O

at	O

i	BE

for	O
how	O

and	O
then	O

um-hum	O

in	O
france	O

that	O

the	O

oh	O
is	O
it	O
henry	O

that	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

without	O

that	O
will	O
eventually	O
die	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
it	C_IP
it	C
just	O
amazes	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
french	O
do	O
n't	O
recognize	O
that	O

except	O
english	O
is	O
just	O

uh-huh	O

how	O
about	O
you	O

you	O
do	O
with	O
your	O
budget	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

we	O
're	O
trying	O
to	O

you	O
know	O
if	O
i	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
clear	O
credit	O
wise	O

but	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
is	O

not	O
much	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
it	O

we	O
're	O
trying	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
put	O
away	O
some	O
savings	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
some	O
day	O

he	O
has	O
this	O
dream	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
long	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
dream	O

we	BE
're	IP
we	C_IE
're	C_IE
kind	IE
of	IE
real	IP
we	C
're	C
really	C
happy	O
that	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
debt	O

but	O
well	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
we	O
're	O
real	O
scared	O
about	O
incurring	O
it	O
in	O
this	O
economy	O
right	O
now	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
stepping	O
real	O
careful	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
's	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
save	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
that	O
we	O
do	O
get	O
you	O
know	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
expenses	O
every	O
month	O

we	O
're	O
missionaries	O
actually	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
easier	O
once	O
we	O
get	O
overseas	O
because	O
we	BE
have	IP
like	IE
i	C_IP
i	C
support	O
quota	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
cheaper	O
to	O
live	O
overseas	O
than	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
live	O
here	O

and	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
switched	O
very	O
easily	O
once	O
you	O
come	O
home	O

so	O

africa	O

area	O

yeah	O

about	O
four	O
years	O

yeah	O

so	O
we	O
go	O
overseas	O
before	O

we	O
come	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
year	O

go	O
over	O
for	O

come	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
year	O

where	O
with	O
wycliffe	O
bible	O
translators	O

so	O

they	O
could	O
very	O
well	O

we	O
will	O
be	O

i	O
was	O
over	O
over	O
for	O
four	O
years	O
doing	O
language	O
surveying	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
step	O

you	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
the	O
scout	O
that	O
goes	O
ahead	O
of	O
the	O
team	O
and	O
assesses	O
the	O
need	O

and	O
came	O
home	O
and	O
got	O
married	O

we	O
'll	O
go	O
back	O
back	O
as	O
translators	O
cause	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
raise	O
a	O
family	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
easier	O
to	O
raise	O
a	O
family	O
as	O
translators	O

well	O
i	O
always	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
translation	O

as	O
long	O
as	O
i	O
was	O
single	O
and	O
footloose	O
so	O
to	O
speak	O
it	O
's	O
easier	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
really	O
need	O
surveyors	O
cause	O
you	BE
can	IP
you	C
're	C
free	O
to	O
travel	O
anywhere	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
kids	O
hanging	O
around	O
and	O
stuff	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
smattering	O
of	O
about	O
ten	O
different	O
ones	O

but	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
bilingual	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
because	O
i	O
kept	O
switching	O
from	O
one	O
area	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
did	O
you	O
know	O
complete	O
a	O
survey	O
in	O
one	O
area	O
which	O
is	O

so	O
i	O
know	O
the	O
greetings	O
in	O
about	O
ten	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
market	O
stuff	O

but	O
in	O
about	BE_IP
about	C
five	O
i	O
guess	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
better	O
in	O
it	O

and	O
my	O
french	O
is	O
pretty	O
good	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
senegalese	O
french	O

so	O
i	O
'm	O
terrified	O
to	O
speak	O
it	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
france	O

because	O
they	O
're	O
real	O
snobby	O
about	O
their	O
language	O

senegalese	O
french	O
is	O
street	O
french	O

i	O
just	O
picked	O
it	O
up	O
off	O
the	O
street	O

and	O
i	BE
knew	IE
what	IP
i	C_IE
was	C_IP
i	C
knew	C
what	O
i	O
was	O
communicating	O

but	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
i	O
was	O
saying	O

i	O
never	O
sat	O
there	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
direct	O
translation	O

that	O
's	O
something	O
here	O
when	O
i	O
came	O
home	O
and	O
french	O
to	O
somebody	O

he	O
paled	O
and	O
said	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
what	O
you	O
said	O

so	O
since	O
then	O
i	O
refrained	O
from	O
speaking	O
any	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
said	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
ask	O
him	O
either	O

so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
putting	O
an	O
elderly	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

i	O
never	O
thought	O
of	O
that	O

yeah	O

until	O
they	O
get	O
over	O
that	O
hump	O
of	O
whatever	O
it	BE
is	IP
they	C
're	C
dealing	O
with	O

yes	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
longer	O
than	O
a	O
week	O

yeah	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
mean	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

and	O
it	O
depends	O
on	O
how	BE_IP
how	C
sick	O
the	O
person	O
is	O
too	O
and	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
capable	O
of	O
like	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
family	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
of	C
your	O
own	O

yeah	O

i	O
would	O
personally	O
like	O

my	O
parents	O
were	O
to	O
get	O
ill	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
home	O
and	O
if	O
i	O
had	O
the	O
money	O
with	O
some	O
help	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
always	O
possible	O

but	O
to	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
my	O
ability	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
until	O
it	O
gets	O
impossible	O

right	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
nursing	O
homes	O
can	O
be	O
good	O

just	O
depends	O
on	O
what	O
kind	O
they	O
are	O

and	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
check	O
them	O
out	O
ahead	O
of	O
time	O

you	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
doing	O
with	O
that	O

yeah	O

oh	O
my	O
grandmother	O
is	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
but	O
a	O
retirement	O
home	O
that	O
also	O
has	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
sort	O
of	O
attached	O
to	O
it	O

and	O
she	O
really	O
liked	O
the	O
idea	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
moving	O
there	O

she	O
is	O
not	O
ill	O
yet	O
but	O
she	O
worked	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
volunteer	O
for	O
about	O
ten	O
years	O

and	O
then	O
she	O
decided	O
that	O
she	O
's	O
eighty	O
five	O
years	O
old	O
that	O
eventually	O
you	O
know	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
does	O
n't	O
want	O
her	O
family	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
him	O
and	O
being	O
a	O
bird	O

she	O
's	O
very	O
independent	O

so	O
she	O
's	O
in	O
this	O
nursing	O
home	O

it	O
's	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
country	O

and	O
she	O
really	O
enjoys	O
it	O
right	O
now	O
because	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
wash	O
dishes	O
or	O
cook	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

some	O
support	O

then	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
wing	O
for	O
those	O
people	O
that	O
do	O
get	O
sick	O

and	O
what	O
i	O
like	O
about	O
it	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
she	O
likes	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
she	O
knows	O
everybody	O
there	O
now	O

and	O
so	O
if	O
she	O
ever	O
does	O
become	O
ill	O
it	O
'll	O
be	O
like	O
family	O
around	O
or	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

she	O
loves	O
it	O

she	O
's	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
social	O
life	O

and	O
she	O
travels	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
missouri	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
mountains	O

it	O
's	O
beautiful	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
hope	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
i	O
guess	O

um-hum	O

oh	O
definitely	O

right	O

okay	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
varies	O
on	BE_IP
on	C
an	O
individual	O
basis	O

sometimes	O
it	BE
is	IP
there	C
is	C
no	O
alternative	O

you	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
family	O
available	O
our	O
family	O
that	O
's	O

you	O
may	O
not	O
even	O
have	O
family	O
that	O
is	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
around	O

so	O
sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
an	O
alternative	O

and	BE
i	IE
think	IP
but	C
i	C
think	C
also	O
sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
a	O

if	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
a	O
short	O

sometimes	O
in	O
a	O

especially	O
after	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C

after	O
an	O

to	O

to	O

after	O
an	O

sometimes	BE_IP
you	C

sometimes	C
in	O
the	O
nursing	O
homes	O
are	O
good	O
for	O
just	O
short	O
periods	O
of	O
time	O

uh-huh	O

because	O
too	O
often	O
the	O
acute	O
hospitals	O
are	O
sending	O
them	O
out	O
and	O
much	O
faster	O
than	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
really	O
able	O
to	O

but	BE_IP
so	C_IP
so	C
there	O
's	O
some	O
good	O
too	O

sometimes	O
too	O
it	O
's	O
used	O
as	O
a	O
dumb	O
job	O

you	O
know	O
well	O
the	O

do	O
not	O
necessarily	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
responsibility	O

put	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
you	O
see	O

there	O
is	O
both	O
sides	O
to	O
it	O
too	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
also	O
where	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
who	O
are	O

there	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
choice	O
because	O
there	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
economically	O
feasible	O
even	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
option	O
sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
available	O
if	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
either	O
medicare	O
insurance	O
to	O
cover	O
it	O

so	O

and	O
then	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
some	O
that	O
are	O
set	O
up	O
for	O
specialties	O
i	O
know	O

unfortunately	O
some	O
elderly	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
our	O
have	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
alzheimer	O
's	O
or	O
where	O
they	O
wander	O
or	O
confused	O
or	O
have	O
some	O
mental	O
problems	O

you	O
need	O
a	O
special	O
nursing	O

one	O
that	O
has	O
a	O

that	O
's	O

where	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

and	O
you	O
need	O
people	O
who	O
are	O

for	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
problem	O

so	BE_IP
so	C
there	O
's	O
different	O

of	O

i	O

there	O

a	O

right	O

i	O

i	O

i	O

although	O
there	O
may	O

i	O

it	O

so	O

yeah	O

oh	O
i	O
do	O
work	O

i	O
've	O
just	O
been	O

that	O
for	O
a	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
my	C
job	C
has	O
most	O
of	O
the	O

i	O
want	O

what	O
i	O
really	O
like	O
is	O
i	O
like	O
being	O

they	O
send	O
me	O
to	O
conferences	O
for	O
instance	O
but	O
probably	O
not	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
nice	O
being	O
you	O
know	O
having	O
a	O
company	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
time	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
thing	O
and	O
sort	O
of	O

they	O
also	O

a	O
really	O
important	O
thing	O
to	O
me	O
is	O
when	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
pay	O
for	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
get	O

that	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
'll	C

right	O
now	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
really	O
good	O

so	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
our	O
politicians	O
are	O
honest	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
in	O
time	O

i	O
agree	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
both	O
of	O
those	O
things	O

but	O
do	O
you	O
see	O
any	O
way	O

it	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
become	O
more	O
honest	O

um-hum	O

probably	O
the	O
only	O
problem	O
i	O
see	O
with	O
term	O
limitations	O
is	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
bureaucracy	O
in	O
our	O
government	O
as	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
with	O
most	O
governments	O
is	O
just	O
so	O
complex	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
low	O
you	O
know	O
there	BE_IP
there	C
is	O
a	O
learning	O

and	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
just	O
send	O
someone	O
off	O
to	O
washington	O
and	O

you	O

his	O
first	O

to	O
be	O
an	O
effective	O

person	O

i	BE

i	C

there	BE
really	IE

there	C

a	C

that	O
they	O

you	O

when	O
you	O
get	O
there	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
bothers	O
me	O
about	O
our	O

is	O
just	O
that	O
in	BE_IP
for	C_IP

it	O
in	O
congress	O
the	O
amount	O

any	BE_IP

at	O
the	BE_IP
you	C

i	O

you	O

i	BE

that	O

however	O
i	O

that	O

i	O

that	O

true	O
of	O

and	O
we	O

and	O

i	O

there	O

maybe	O
i	O
'll	O
keep	O
them	O

and	O
a	O
little	O

more	O
active	O

up	O

i	O
think	O
two	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
extended	O
you	O

term	O

for	O
congress	O
would	O
be	O

three	O

or	O
even	O
four	O

or	O
you	O
would	O
increase	O
the	O
length	O
of	BE
the	IP
of	C
each	C

but	O
maybe	O
standardizing	O
on	BE_IP
on	C
a	BE_IP
a	C
four	O

for	O
congress	O

and	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
staggering	O
them	O
so	O
that	O
you	O

n't	O

yeah	O
we	O
are	O
n't	O

a	O

um-hum	O

i	BE

i	C

that	O
that	O

then	O
you	BE

you	C
have	C
the	O

for	O
a	O

i	O

a	O
two	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE_IP
it	C_IE

a	O

i	O

i	O

i	O

there	O
's	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
officially	O

i	O
mean	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
not	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
there	BE

there	C

advantages	O
to	O

and	O
turn	O
or	O
not	O

a	O

every	O
some	O

i	BE

i	C

there	C
's	C
an	C
institutional	O

that	O
you	O
need	O
to	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
oh	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
perks	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
given	O
them	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
heard	O
on	O
the	O
radio	O
back	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
few	O
weeks	O
ago	O
during	O
the	O
incidents	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
like	O
they	O
are	O
n't	O
paying	O
their	BE_IP
their	C
restaurant	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
bouncing	O

all	BE
over	IE
the	IE

one	C
of	C
the	C

over	O
here	O
listed	O
off	O
every	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
perks	O

so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
like	O
new	O
jersey	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
new	O
jersey	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
but	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
fairly	O
industrial	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
about	O
you	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
always	O
considered	O
automobiles	O
to	O
be	O
probably	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
prime	O
contributor	O

i	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
contributors	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
automobiles	O
would	O
probably	O
do	O
more	O
than	O
their	O
fair	O
share	O
of	O
that	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
big	O
issue	O
is	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
states	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
inspection	O
law	O

so	O
you	BE
get	IP
you	C
get	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
out	O
there	O
without	O
e	BE_IP
t	C_IP
r	C_IP
emission	C
control	O
systems	O
on	O
their	O
cars	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
like	O

sure	O

right	O

i	O
guess	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
hear	O
though	O
next	O
year	O
ford	O
is	O
coming	O
out	O
with	O
their	O
electric	O
cars	O

actually	O
coming	O
out	O
with	O
first	O
prototypes	O
in	O
california	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
hoping	O
that	O
comes	O
along	O
quick	O

i	O
was	O
reading	O
an	O
article	O
in	O
time	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
about	O
the	O
ozone	O
layer	O
and	O
how	O
fast	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
really	O
disappearing	O
a	O
lot	O
quicker	O
than	O
people	O
realize	O

that	BE
's	IE
not	IE
due	IE
to	IP
it	C
's	C
not	C
due	O
to	O
gasoline	O
or	O
too	O
you	O
know	O
carbon	O
monoxide	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
the	O
c	O
f	O
c's	O

i	O
think	O
that	BE
's	IE
a	IP
that	C
's	C
a	C
contributor	O
definitely	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
right	O
now	O
what	BE
they	IE
're	IP
what	C
they	C
're	C
primarily	BE_IP
worried	C
about	O
third	O
world	O
countries	O
because	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
russia	O
has	O
kind	O
of	O
taken	O
the	O
lead	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
eliminating	O
c	O
f	O
c	O

oh	O

um-hum	O

and	O
that	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
arguments	O
that	O
the	O
third	O
world	O
countries	O
have	O
been	O
using	O
is	O
basically	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
our	O
mistakes	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
that	O
makes	O
any	O
sense	O

in	O
terms	O
of	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

those	BE
are	IE
kind	IE
of	IP
yeah	C
those	C
are	C
joining	O
arguments	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
an	O
interesting	O
situation	O
there	O

what	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
realize	O
the	O
third	O
world	O
countries	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
realize	O
how	O
quickly	O
the	O
ozone	O
depleter	O

the	O
latest	O
figures	O
are	O
up	O
to	O
fifty	O
percent	O
of	O
the	O
poles	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
increasing	O
even	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
equator	O
as	O
like	O
florida	O
and	O
cuba	O
and	O
those	O
places	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
interesting	O
situation	O

not	O
a	O
real	O
good	O
one	O

yeah	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
source	O
of	O
cleansing	O
anymore	O

have	O
you	O
been	O
in	O
big	O
cities	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

okay	O

so	O
you	O
've	O
got	O

yeah	O

those	O
are	O
actually	O
areas	O
that	O
are	O
hit	O
pretty	O
hard	O
i	O
would	O
think	O

denver	O
's	O
got	O
to	O
be	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O

sure	O

yeah	O

denver	O
is	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
real	BE
good	IP
real	C
good	C
example	O
of	O
sitting	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
mexico	O
city	O
does	O
i	O
guess	O

mexico	O
city	O
is	O
historically	O
been	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
world	O
for	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
pretty	O
lucky	O

i	O
've	O
lived	O
in	O
cities	O
that	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
that	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O
although	O
i	O
'm	O
really	O
kind	O
of	O
based	O
in	O
orlando	O
florida	O

and	O
there	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
getting	O
worse	O

i	O
mean	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
definitely	O
is	O
not	O
at	O
a	O
level	O
comparable	O
to	O
los	O
angeles	O
or	O
denver	O

but	O
you	O
can	O

exactly	O

yeah	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
much	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
public	O
transportation	O
down	O
there	O

there	O
is	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O

you	O
get	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
here	O

you	O
do	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
bit	O
of	O

and	O
stuff	O
especially	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
fuel	O

yeah	O

when	O
you	O
get	O
further	O
east	O
towards	O
new	O

city	O
it	O
gets	O
very	O
industrial	O
but	O
i	O
'm	O
about	O
thirty	O
miles	O
west	O

so	O
you	O

you	O

you	O

you	BE_IP
you	C

which	O

just	O
terrible	O
it	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
almost	O
automobiles	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
much	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
heavy	O

and	O
all	O
that	O
would	O
be	O

so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
your	O

wow	O

so	O
when	O
you	O
say	O
in	O
the	O

or	O

news	O
national	O
news	O
as	O

oh	O
okay	O

well	O
i	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
a	O
junkier	O
's	O
watch	O
c	O
n	O
n	O
a	O
lot	O

but	O
i	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
subscribe	O
to	O

because	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
service	O
and	O
also	O
because	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
give	O
the	O
united	O
way	O

so	O
i	O
figured	O
that	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
i	O
just	O
donate	O
to	O
that	O

yeah	O

take	O
away	O
a	O
addiction	O

or	O
something	O

oh	O

what	BE_IP
what	C
newspapers	O

for	O
a	O
while	O
there	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
subscribe	O
to	O
new	O

and	O
actually	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O

because	O
you	O
know	O
my	O
fiance	O

well	O
she	O
was	O
unemployed	O
for	O

you	O
know	O
really	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
they	O
want	O
help	O
wanted	O
ads	O
and	O
so	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
try	O
the	O
newspapers	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
compete	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
other	O
source	O
of	O
the	O
newspaper	O
of	O
news	O

and	O

new	O
york	O

is	O
okay	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
read	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
this	O
stuff	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
quality	O
of	O
the	O
riding	O
is	O
definitely	O
gone	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
ten	O
years	O
or	O
so	O

i	O
mean	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
say	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
the	O
sixth	O
grade	O
reading	O
level	O

but	O
i	O
swear	O
the	O
least	O
second	O
or	O
third	O
grade	O
sometimes	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
if	O
you	O
listen	O
to	O
like	O
n	O
p	O

or	O
something	O

that	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O

and	O
i	O

that	O

when	O
i	O

a	O
chance	O
when	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
long	O
enough	O

because	O
i	O

well	O
macneil	O
lehrer	O
mcneil	O

i	O

he	O
's	O
leaving	O

one	O
of	O
them	O

that	O
they	O
're	O
pretty	O
good	O
too	O

i	O
guess	O
a	O
year	O

you	O
're	O
probably	O
watching	O
c	O
n	O
n	O
a	O

whatever	O
it	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O

i	O

a	O

it	O
's	O
still	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

look	O
at	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

i	O

that	O
was	O
a	O
joke	O

oh	O
yeah	O

n	BE_IP

that	O

yeah	O

i	O
had	O
some	O

he	BE
was	IE

just	C
i	C
do	C
not	C

fixated	O
on	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
listening	O
to	O
it	O
constantly	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
when	O
it	O
's	O
alive	O
if	BE
you	IP
if	C
you	C
really	O

that	O
's	O
not	O

providing	O
your	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
more	O
like	O
a	O

oh	O
really	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
boring	O
to	O
me	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

but	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
ways	O
that	O
i	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

you	O

a	O
off	O

i	O
would	O

low	O

usually	O
you	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
why	BE_IP
why	C
i	O
try	O
and	O
get	O
as	O

because	O
if	O
you	O

then	O
you	O

you	O

oh	O

oh	O
i	O

down	O
what	O

you	O

what	O
it	O
's	O

you	O

not	BE
that	IP

so	O
i	O

my	O

you	O

you	O

i	O

i	O

is	O
read	O
a	O

i	O

the	O

book	O
they	O

you	O

in	O
the	O

and	O
go	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
seems	O
absurd	O
that	O
people	O
will	O
pay	O
you	O

some	O
bucks	O
just	O
to	O
get	O
someone	O

i	O
guess	O
if	O
you	O

some	O
really	O
complicated	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
mess	O
with	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
only	O
use	O
a	O
calculator	O
either	O

i	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
i	C
do	C
n't	C
have	O
that	BE
much	IP
that	C
many	C
you	C

things	C
that	C

oh	O
yeah	O

and	O
we	O
have	O

i	O
beg	O
at	O
n	O
c	O
n	O
b	O
here	O

and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
number	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
call	O

and	O
i	O
always	O
call	O
in	O
like	O
once	O
every	O
other	O
week	O
or	O
so	O

and	O
i	O
will	O
check	O
off	O
what	O
checks	O

do	O
you	O
do	O
that	O

you	O
too	O

and	O
i	O
always	O
check	O
them	O
off	O
and	O
you	O

check	O
my	O

in	O
my	O

and	BE_IP
you	C

because	C
i	O

you	O

i	O

so	O

so	O
what	BE

what	C

your	O

yes	O

so	O

they	O

yes	O

that	O
's	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
true	O

yes	O

yes	O

i	O

in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
kind	O

the	O

if	O

yes	O

that	O
would	O
be	O
the	O

well	O
i	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O

a	O

if	BE_IP

yes	O

um-hum	O

that	O

what	O

a	O

how	O

you	O

i	O

a	O

you	O

because	BE_IP
you	C

end	O
up	O
paying	O
for	O
the	O

of	O

i	O
think	O
they	O

but	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
is	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
apply	O
for	BE_IP

to	O
get	O
a	O

you	O

that	O
you	O

i	BE

that	IP
that	C

that	O

today	O

you	O

and	O
you	O

it	O
certainly	O

but	O
the	O

side	O
to	O
that	O
is	O
if	O
you	O

there	O
's	O
a	O

or	O
you	O

you	O

so	O
that	O
you	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
question	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
ever	O
quite	O
problem	O
with	O
capital	O

you	O
run	O
into	O
is	O
what	O
are	O
you	O
gonna	O
do	O
about	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
later	O
found	O
him	O
innocent	O

there	O
are	O
cases	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
twenty	O
thirty	O
years	O
after	O
the	O
fact	O
they	O
're	O
getting	O

especially	O
as	O
new	O
technology	O
comes	O
along	O
with	O
my	O
prove	O
their	O
innocence	O

i	O
guess	O
we	O
killed	O
her	O

you	O
can	O
apologize	O
nicely	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
price	O

i	O
've	O
heard	O
quotes	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
better	O
than	O
a	O
thousand	O
people	O
go	O
free	O
than	O
one	O
person	O
be	O
unjustly	O
imprisoned	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
philosophy	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
our	O
legal	O
system	O
works	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
the	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O

and	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
you	O
listen	O
to	O
bushes	O

well	O
where	O
are	O
we	O
gonna	BE_IP
impose	C
dry	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
the	O
drug	O
dealers	O
is	O
new	O
big	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
saying	O
you	O
know	O
capital	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
capital	O
crime	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
major	O
drug	O
dealer	O

and	O
again	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
these	O
people	O

the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O
lives	O
everyday	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
you	O
know	O
especially	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
live	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
massachusetts	O

we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
capital	O
punishment	O
here	O
probably	O
after	O
the	O
second	O
coming	O
or	O
something	O

so	O

but	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
our	O
crime	O
rates	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
be	O
compared	O
to	O
like	O
texas	O
is	O
someplace	O
where	O
does	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
impossible	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
case	O
but	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
affecting	O
it	O
anyway	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
mainly	O
people	O
like	O
they	O
did	O
the	O
vengeance	O
of	O
it	O

yeah	O

oh	O
yeah	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
blacks	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
young	O
people	O

you	O
know	O
a	O
sixty	O
two	O
year	O
old	O
guy	O
is	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
on	O
death	O
row	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O

you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
listen	O
to	O
like	O
the	BE_IP
the	C_IP
the	C
victims'	O
families	O
and	O
things	O
they	O
're	O
always	O
talking	O
about	O
you	O
know	O
feeling	O
justified	O
or	O
feeling	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
they	O
've	O
gotten	O
to	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

i	O
mean	O
my	O
son	O
has	O
been	O
once	O
the	O
guy	O
has	O
been	O
imprisoned	O
if	O
he	O
goes	O
to	O
jail	O
forever	O
or	O
whatever	O
or	O
if	O
he	O
gets	O
killed	O
it	O
should	O
n't	O
make	O
any	O
difference	O
to	BE
the	IP
to	C
the	C
victim	O
's	O
family	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
should	O
really	O

obviously	O
if	O
someone	O
of	O
mine	O
who	O
was	O
close	O
died	O
i	O
'd	O
probably	O
feel	O
differently	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
that	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
what	C
the	O
important	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
be	O
caught	O
and	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
danger	O
to	O
society	O

the	O
other	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
was	O
reading	O
through	O
a	O
book	O
on	O
genome	O
human	O
genome	O
research	O
and	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
things	O
like	O
schizophrenia	O

it	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
genetic	O
or	O
biochemical	O
in	O
origin	O

so	O
if	O
someday	O
we	O
can	O
go	O
to	O
jeff	O
dahmer	O
and	O
say	O
well	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
you	BE_IP
you	C

an	O
endorphin	O

you	O

if	O
you	O

this	O
regularly	O
you	O
'll	O
be	O
a	O
sane	O
and	O
productive	O
member	O
of	O

you	O
really	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
the	O

you	O

if	O
someone	O

for	O

society	O
made	O
me	O

it	O

i	O

i	O
've	O

some	O
statistics	O
that	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
expensive	O
to	O
kill	O
somebody	O
than	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O

committing	BE
a	IP
mostly	C

you	O

either	O

at	O
the	O

they	O

they	O

not	O

we	O

whether	O

worthwhile	O
on	O
the	O

for	O

someone	O
like	O
jeffrey	O

by	O
putting	O
him	O

there	O
's	O
still	O
a	O

that	O

if	O

him	O
there	O
is	O

i	O

he	O

in	O

yes	O

yeah	O
it	BE

it	C
's	C

once	O
you	O

the	O

the	BE_IP

and	BE_IP
and	C
munich	O
and	O
i	BE

there	O
this	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C

interesting	O

i	O
also	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
portion	O

and	O
it	BE
was	IP
it	C
was	C
amazing	O
how	O
they	O
were	O
completely	O
opposed	O

yeah	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
b	O
m	O
w	O
is	BE
really	IE
a	IP
like	C_IE
a	C_IP
we	C
have	C
all	C
these	C
like	O
high	O
tech	O
things	O

everything	O
is	O
put	O
together	O
with	O

tolerances	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
go	O
to	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
well	O
these	O
cars	O
are	O
completely	O
handmade	O
and	O
no	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
are	O

and	O
so	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
completely	O
opposed	O

which	O
do	O
i	O
like	O
better	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
liked	O
that	O
forces	O
philosophy	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
better	O
although	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
practical	O

unless	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
a	O
toy	O

let	O
's	O
face	O
it	O

yeah	O

b	O
m	O
w	O
is	O
good	O
for	O
that	O

what	O
kind	O
of	O
driving	O
just	O
like	O
commuting	O
you	O
'd	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
before	O

oh	O
yeah	O

that	O
's	O
cool	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
good	O

so	O
i	O
was	O
impressed	O
by	BE_IP
by	C
the	O
mercedes	O
too	O

i	BE
really	IP
i	C
really	C
like	O
the	O
mercedes	O

the	O
factory	O
was	O
nice	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
different	O
for	BE
the	IP
for	C
the	C
b	O
m	O
w	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
can	O
imagine	O
that	O

so	O
you	BE
're	IE
an	IE
american	IP
you	C
want	C
to	C
buy	C
american	O

in	O
terms	O
of	O
handling	O
situation	O

what	O
about	O
mustang	O
g	O
t's	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
once	O
in	O
a	O
lower	O
lower	O
and	O
rice	O

right	O

well	O
you	O
can	O
wait	O
till	O
you	O
graduate	O

plenty	O
of	O
money	O

whatever	O
you	O
want	O

right	O

did	O
you	O
use	O
that	O
for	O
city	O
driving	O
interesting	O

auto	O
crossing	O
is	O

what	O
kind	O
of	O
truck	O

and	O
you	O
put	O
up	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
the	O
track	O
pylons	O

okay	O

oh	O

i	O
would	O
guess	O
so	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
get	O
b	O
m	O
w	O
or	O
if	O
i	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
german	O
route	O
which	O
i	O
'm	O
kind	O
of	O
leaning	O
towards	O
right	O
now	O
but	BE_IP
or	C
maybe	O
a	O
hot	O
i	O
mean	O
acura	O
legend	O
a	O
lexus	O
s	O
c	O
three	O
hundred	O
maybe	O
something	O
on	O
that	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
determined	O
if	O
i	O
like	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
japanese	O
or	O
the	BE_IP
if	O
i	O
like	O
them	O
enough	O
to	O
purchase	O
one	O
you	O
know	O
because	O
your	BE
b	IE
m	IE
w's	IP
your	C
german	C
cars	C
have	O
good	O
reputations	O
i	O
think	O

yes	O

yeah	O

they	BE_IP
they	C_IE
're	C_IP
they	C
have	O
the	O
whole	O
philosophy	O

i	O
mean	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
kind	O
of	O
even	O
brainwash	O
themselves	O
into	O
thinking	O
they	O
're	O
better	O
which	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	O
to	O
take	O

i	O
mean	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
walking	O
through	O
that	O
little	O
tour	O
in	O
munich	O
it	BE
's	IE
kind	IE
of	IP
they	C
're	C
trying	C
to	C
brainwash	O
you	O
too	O

oh	O
really	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
realistic	O

yeah	O

if	O
you	O
can	O
afford	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
toy	O
then	O
i	O
guess	O

yeah	O

work	O

short	O
trips	O

no	BE_IP
no	C
heavy	O
mileage	O

putting	O
on	O
less	O
than	O
fifteen	O
thousand	O
miles	O
a	O
year	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
minimal	O

last	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

that	O
's	O
mainly	O
what	O
i	O
'm	O
looking	O
for	O

oh	O
yeah	O

but	BE_IP
but	C
if	BE_IP
if	C
you	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
with	O
the	O
mercedes	O
you	O
take	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
shop	O
they	BE
're	IE
going	IE
to	IP
they	C
're	C
going	C
to	C
hit	O
you	O
out	O
for	O
just	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O

i	O
think	O
well	O
something	O
on	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
a	O
three	O
series	O
is	O
probably	O
different	O

once	O
you	O
get	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
five	O
series	O
and	O
higher	O
than	O
all	O
your	O
repair	O
costs	O
go	O
up	O
significantly	O

so	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
i	O
really	O

about	O
texas	O

spend	O
what	O
you	O
have	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
general	O
idea	O
is	O
just	O
you	O
know	O
spend	O
during	O
a	O
time	O
of	O
recession	O
that	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
for	C
the	O
deficit	O
spending	O
to	O
help	O
pick	O
up	O
the	O
economy	O

but	O
they	O
're	O
running	O
under	O
the	O

you	O
know	O
the	O
way	O
they	O
're	O
running	O
it	O
now	O
they	O
're	O
you	O
know	O
running	O
under	O
a	O
deficit	O
spending	O
you	O
know	O
while	O
we	O
're	O
not	O
under	O
a	O
recession	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
never	O
any	O
surplus	O
coming	O
into	O
counter	O
the	O
deficit	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
running	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
basic	O
thing	O
of	O
economics	O
i	O
guess	O
keep	O
spending	O
keep	O
going	O
into	O
debt	O

they	O
're	O
not	O
gonna	O
payoff	O
what	O
you	O
owe	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
question	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
you	O
know	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O

yeah	O

i	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

i	O
guess	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	O
student	O
right	O
now	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
make	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
do	O
n't	O
pay	O
a	O
proportionate	O
amount	O
of	O
taxes	O
i	O
guess	O
compared	O
to	O
what	O
i	O
get	O
because	O
i	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
my	C_IP
my	C
education	O
is	O
state	O
sponsored	O

to	O
a	O
state	O
sponsored	O
school	O

and	O
my	O
education	O
all	O
through	O
high	O
school	O
and	O
stuff	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
'm	O
kind	O
of	O
in	O
debt	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
suppose	O
because	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
you	O
know	O
been	O
paying	O
taxes	O
all	BE
that	IP
all	C
that	C
long	O

my	O
parents	O
i	O
guess	O
however	O
contributed	O
to	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
the	O
education	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
everything	O

i	O
usually	O
end	O
up	O
getting	O
money	O
back	O

well	O
this	O
year	O
anyway	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
need	O
it	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

more	O
taxes	O
you	O
pay	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
hidden	O
taxes	O

um-hum	O

the	O
taxes	O
that	O
people	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
about	O
that	O

yeah	O

but	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
income	O
tax	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
visible	O
portion	O
of	O
the	O
taxes	O
you	O
pay	O
i	O
guess	O

uh-huh	O

jerry	O
brown	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
democratic	O
candidates	O
had	O
a	O
proposal	O
for	O
doing	O
away	O
with	O
all	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
tax	O
codes	O
they	O
have	O
now	O
and	O
implementing	O
us	O
i	O
think	O
a	O
flat	O
percentage	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

right	O

exactly	O

because	O
up	O
until	O
like	O
eight	O

up	O
until	O
like	O
eighty	O
five	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
a	O
necessary	O
evil	O

i	O
wish	O
the	O
government	O
would	O
operate	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
premise	O
that	O
businesses	O
operate	O
on	O

and	O
that	O
is	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
spend	O
more	O
than	O
you	O
then	O
you	O
bring	O
in	O

well	O

it	O
just	O
depends	O

roads	O
are	O
very	O
expensive	O
commodity	O
and	O
so	O
is	O
utilities	O
they	O
supply	O
and	O
police	O
and	O
fire	O
department	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
living	O

so	O
i	O
think	O
for	BE_IP
for	C_IP
for	C
many	O
years	O
we	O
pay	O
teachers	O
and	O
police	O
officers	O
and	O
firemen	O
who	O
are	O
two	O
great	O
extent	O
public	O
servants	O
we	O
have	O
not	O
paid	O
them	O
really	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
working	O
with	O
they	O
contribute	O
to	O
society	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
hard	O
to	O
justify	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
wastefulness	O
of	O
money	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
spends	O
on	O
all	O
levels	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
government	O
including	O
municipalities	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
state	O
and	O
federal	O
governments	O

you	O
're	O
very	O
fortunate	O

we	O
just	O
try	O
not	O
to	O
pay	O
any	O
more	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
have	O
too	O

we	O
pay	O
in	O
a	O
substantial	O
amount	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
regret	O
paying	O
taxes	O

i	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
sometimes	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
reverse	O
of	O
a	BE
regressive	IE
tax	IP
a	C
progressive	C
tax	C

progressive	O
tax	O
i	O
think	O
just	O
not	O
give	O
people	O
incentive	O
to	O
make	O
more	O
money	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
by	O
that	O
the	O
more	O

you	O
make	O
the	O
more	O
tax	O
you	O
pay	O

it	O
should	O
be	O
i	O

a	O

and	O
that	O

ought	O
to	O
be	O
an	O

no	O

internship	O
up	O
here	O
for	O
a	O
year	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
go	O
back	O
down	O

but	O

yeah	O

i	O
was	O
a	O
real	O
good	O
dog	O

what	O
possessed	O
you	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
dog	O

oh	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
learn	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
discipline	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
care	O
for	O
it	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

that	O
kind	O
of	O
built	O
some	O
character	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O

that	O
's	O
something	O
that	O
's	O
important	O
for	O
sure	O

i	O
think	O
do	O
you	O
live	O
in	O
an	O
accident	O
fairly	O
rural	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
tune	O
or	O

oh	O
i	O
see	O

yeah	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
big	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O

with	O
domino	O
she	O
was	O
full	O
grown	O

i	O
would	O
estimate	O
seventy	O
pounds	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
lived	O
in	O
oviedo	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
town	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
suburb	O
of	O
orlando	O
but	O
there	BE
's	IE
not	IP
there	C
was	C
n't	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
room	O
for	O
her	O
to	O
run	O
around	O

and	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
dog	O
loved	O
to	O
run	O

so	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
biggest	O
problem	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
issues	O
people	O
need	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
before	O
they	O
get	O
a	O
dog	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
room	O
for	O
this	O
dog	O
to	O
run	O
around	O

yeah	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
really	O
ca	O
n't	O
speak	O
for	O
cats	O

and	O
cats	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
along	O
too	O
well	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
whole	O
space	O
issue	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
real	O
important	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
part	BE
of	IE
your	IP
of	C
keeping	C
your	C
part	O
of	O
the	O
relationship	O
you	O
know	O
showing	O
the	O
maturity	O
and	O
responsibility	O
to	O
recognize	O
those	BE_IP
those	C
issues	O

you	O
know	O
and	O
also	O
the	BE
whole	IP
the	C
whole	C
thing	O
with	O
noise	O

my	O
mother	O
she	O
freaks	O
out	O
because	O
she	O
's	O
got	O
neighbors	O
that	O
have	O
dogs	O
that	O
do	O
n't	O
train	O
them	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
we	BE
had	IP
we	C
had	C
a	O
neighbor	O
in	O
nebraska	O
when	O
we	O
lived	O
there	O
that	O
had	O
brittany	O
spaniels	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
high	O
strung	O
animals	O
to	O
begin	O
with	O

but	O

yeah	O

we	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
pet	O

we	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
dog	O
that	O
we	O
got	O
from	O
the	O

well	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
the	O
s	O
p	O
c	O
a	O

the	BE_IP
and	C
from	C
an	O
animal	O
shelter	O

he	O
had	O
come	O
in	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
street	O

a	O
pomeranian	O
and	O
sheltie	O
cross	O

oh	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
trained	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
it	O

no	O

we	O
suspect	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
hurt	O
in	O
an	O
accident	O
you	O
know	O
got	O
away	O
from	O
somebody	O
traveling	O
through	O
would	O
hurt	O
in	O
an	O
accident	O
because	O
the	O
dog	O
that	O
looks	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
he	O
does	O
in	O
his	O
trained	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
someone	O
that	O
has	O
lost	O
them	O
and	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
locate	O

and	O
they	BE
were	IP
local	C
people	C
they	C
would	C
have	C
been	C
able	O
to	O
find	O

yeah	O

oh	O
i	O
think	O
so	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
we	O
felt	O
that	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
nice	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
dog	O
even	O
though	O
there	O
are	O
you	O
know	O
complications	O
come	O
with	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
with	O
our	O
children	O

at	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
oh	O
grade	O
five	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
great	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
age	O
where	O
it	BE
was	IP
we	C
thought	C
it	C
would	C
be	C
good	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
discipline	O
that	O
goes	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
having	O
a	O
pet	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
idea	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
perhaps	O

it	O
depends	O
on	BE
the	IP
on	C
everyone	O
's	O
discipline	O

and	O
from	O
that	O
aspect	O
i	O
'm	O
short	O
on	O
the	O
discipline	O
because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
enforce	O
that	O
the	O
kids	O
look	O
after	O
the	O
dog	O

and	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
him	O
about	O
four	O
years	O
now	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
does	O
it	O

it	O
's	O
necessary	O
that	O
individuals	O
have	O
the	O
discipline	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
the	O
animal	O
properly	O

actually	O

we	O
live	O
in	BE
a	IP
in	C
an	C
area	O
that	O
's	O
oh	O
probably	O
about	O
two	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
university	O

we	BE
live	IP
right	C
might	C
say	C
we	C
live	C
right	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
middle	O
of	O
a	O
residential	O
area	O

and	O
so	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
as	O
good	O

this	O
dog	O
being	O
a	O
small	O
dog	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
you	O
more	O
acceptable	O
but	O
again	O

yeah	O

it	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
concern	O

it	O
's	O
like	O

a	O
lot	O
to	O
be	O
gained	O
from	O
a	O
relationship	O
with	O
an	O
animal	O

but	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
one	O
has	O
to	O
recognize	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
physical	O
requirements	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O
animals	O
and	O
the	O
larger	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
more	O
room	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
exercise	O

okay	O

so	BE_IP
but	C
the	O
issue	O
of	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
actually	O
found	O
the	O
whole	O
question	O
about	O
whether	O
you	O
need	O
a	BE_IP
a	C_IP
you	C
know	C
a	C
unanimous	O
verdict	O
and	O
a	O
criminal	O
case	O
to	O
be	O
somewhat	O
interesting	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
even	O
true	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
always	O
unanimous	O
because	O
i	O
thought	O
they	O
were	O
cases	O
where	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
felonies	O
and	O
misdemeanors	O
but	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
okay	O
for	O
a	O
state	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
like	O
eleven	O
out	O
of	O
twelve	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
'd	O
be	O
curious	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
requirement	O
for	O
an	O
acquittal	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
wrong	O
to	O
save	O
that	O
eleven	O
out	O
of	O
twelve	O
can	O
convict	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
something	O
corresponding	O
saying	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
voted	O
not	O
guilty	O
then	O
instead	O
of	O
being	O
a	O
hung	O
jury	O
that	O
was	O
an	O
acquittal	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
whether	O
you	O
need	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
unanimous	O
vote	O
of	O
not	O
guilty	O
to	O
acquit	O

yeah	O

i	O
'd	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

i	O
've	O
never	O
had	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
serve	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O
although	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
out	O
here	O
and	O
registered	O
for	O
i	O
guess	O
about	O
five	O
years	O

the	O
people	O
i	O
know	O
served	O
have	O
said	O
that	O
usually	O
what	O
ended	O
up	O
happening	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
after	O
initially	O
finding	O
out	O
where	O
people	O
stand	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
deliberation	O
usually	O
results	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
a	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
something	C
like	C
a	C
ninety	O
three	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
more	O
severe	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
majority	O
trying	O
to	O
convince	O
the	O
minority	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
right	O
and	O
in	O
fact	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
anymore	O
liable	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
reasonable	O
doubt	O
than	BE_IP
than	C
anything	O
else	O

one	O
book	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
called	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
of	O
all	O
things	O
but	O
went	O
through	O
an	BE
interviewed	IP
a	C
bunch	C
of	O
jurors	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
big	O
cases	O
and	O
in	O
many	O
cases	O
looking	O
at	O
what	O
happened	O
at	O
the	O
evidence	O
afterwards	O
as	O
to	O
whether	O
the	O
decision	O
was	O
right	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
jurors	O
based	O
on	O
deliberations	O

and	O
did	O
say	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
left	O
opposing	O
the	O
verdict	O
you	O
know	O
everyone	O
was	O
getting	O
on	O
them	O
so	BE_IP
so	C
heavily	O
that	O
eventually	O
they	O
just	O
gave	O
in	O
knowing	O
that	O
nothing	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
could	O
stop	O
it	O
from	O
either	O
being	O
the	O
verdict	O
everyone	O
else	O
was	O
trying	O
for	O
or	O
a	O
hung	O
jury	O
because	O
the	O
one	O
vote	O
does	O
n't	O
need	O
anything	O
except	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
not	O
have	O
a	O
verdict	O

yeah	O

actually	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
agree	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
interesting	O
thing	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
believe	O
that	BE
's	IE
a	IP
for	C_IP
for	C
civil	O
suits	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
unanimous	O
right	O

but	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
criminal	O
suits	O
it	O
's	O
unanimous	O
by	O
federal	O
law	O

yeah	O

actually	O
thought	O
i	O
'd	O
read	O
that	O
too	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
i	O
phrased	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

i	O
wonder	O

the	BE
difference	IP
yeah	C
the	C
difference	C
could	O
be	O
that	O
for	O
state	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
state	O
felonies	O
versus	O
federal	O
felonies	O
that	O
federal	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
under	O
federal	O
jurisdiction	O
require	O
the	O
unanimous	O
vote	O

things	O
that	O
are	O
under	O
state	O
jurisdiction	O
even	O
criminals	O
do	O
n't	O
require	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
laws	O

you	O
think	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
unreasonable	O
requirement	O
that	O
they	O
be	O
unanimous	O

yeah	O

that	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
interesting	O
change	O

it	O
would	O
also	O
allow	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
had	O
one	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
disagreeable	O
that	O
i	O
mean	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
fundamentally	O
changes	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
processing	O
occurs	O
because	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	BE
's	IP
well	C_IE
the	C_IP
the	C
principle	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
unanimous	O
insures	O
the	O
beyond	O
a	O
reasonable	O
doubt	O
criterion	O
that	O
it	O
increases	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
likelihood	O
of	O
getting	O
the	O
proper	O
judgment	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
if	O
anything	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
close	O
to	O
unanimous	O
decision	O

yeah	O

actually	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
thought	O
that	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
interesting	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
out	O
here	O
twenty	O
some	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
called	O
three	O
different	O
times	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
actually	O
even	O
made	O
it	O
into	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
jury	O
box	O
and	BE_IP
because	O
they	O
've	O
always	O
been	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
people	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
gotten	O
up	O
there	O
to	O
answer	O
the	O
questions	O

i	O
also	O
think	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
really	O
good	O

um-hum	O

the	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
i	O
know	O
it	O
does	O
seem	O
to	O
happen	O
from	O
people	O
i	O

to	O
on	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
in	O
the	O

you	O
just	O

where	O
it	O
's	O
nine	O
to	O
three	O
or	O
some	O
such	O
number	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
an	O

that	O
there	O
's	O
a	O

and	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
peer	O

some	O
cases	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
long	O

the	O

that	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
understand	O

you	O
would	O
hope	O
that	O
if	O

yeah	O

it	BE

about	O
it	O
i	BE_IP
my	O

and	O
that	O
we	O
both	O

have	O
a	O

we	O
stick	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
surprises	O
in	O
that	O

well	O
actually	O
i	O
have	O
four	O
kids	O

a	O
couple	O
of	O
kids	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
should	O
have	O
specified	O

for	O
four	O
little	O
boys	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

oh	O
good	O

yeah	O

what	O
year	O
are	O
you	O
in	O

uh-huh	O

so	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
few	O
more	O
years	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
good	O
for	O
you	O

yeah	O

i	O
imagine	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
difficult	O
to	O
stick	O
with	O
a	O
budget	O
during	BE_IP
during	C
school	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O

well	O
great	O

sometimes	O
i	O
feel	O
a	O
little	O
hard	O
with	O
books	O
and	O
music	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
sheet	O
music	O
and	O
stuff	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
work	O
on	O

oh	O
yes	O

yes	O

well	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
a	O
starving	O
artist	O
yet	O

well	O
good	O

there	O
's	O
enough	O
of	O
those	O
in	O
the	O
world	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O

who	BE
is	IP
there	C
is	C
not	O
very	O
well	O
educated	O

oh	O
yes	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

i	O
found	O
that	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
i	O
'm	O
planning	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
preparing	O
for	O
the	O
education	O
of	O
my	O
children	O
also	O
try	O
and	O
set	O
that	O
money	O
is	O

i	O
majored	O
in	O
business	O
administration	O

yeah	O

but	O
once	O
again	O

right	O
now	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
college	O

and	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
work	O
study	O
and	O
so	O
my	O
budget	O
comes	O
from	O
my	O
dad	O
's	O
help	O

he	O
kills	O
me	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O

and	O
i	O
get	O
paid	O
monthly	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
budget	O

my	O
mother	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
paid	O
much	O
money	O

so	O
her	O
budget	O
is	O
just	O
planning	O
for	O
i	O
r	O
a's	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

that	O
sounds	O
good	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

well	O
good	O

with	O
two	O
kids	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
hard	O

oh	O
my	O
goodness	O

oh	O
boy	O

oh	O
my	O
goodness	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
sister	O

and	O
my	O
parents	O
divorced	O
three	O
years	O
ago	O
and	O
my	O
sister	O
had	O
gotten	O
through	O
college	O

but	O
i	O
was	O
still	O
in	O
high	O
school	O

and	O
my	O
mother	O
paid	O
for	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
my	O
sister	O
's	O
college	O
while	O
my	O
parents	O
were	O
together	O
and	O
then	O
before	O
the	O
divorce	O
she	O
had	O
saved	O
for	O
my	O
college	O

but	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
divorce	O
she	O
just	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
much	O
money	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
spend	O
it	O
all	O
on	O
getting	O
another	O
house	O

so	O
now	O
my	O
dad	O
's	O
paying	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
my	O
college	O

financial	O
aid	O
and	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
music	O
major	O

so	O
i	O
have	O
auditions	O
coming	O
up	O

i	O
'm	O
a	O
sophomore	O

right	O

i	O
'll	O
probably	O
have	O
about	O
two	O
two	O
and	O
a	O
half	O

left	O

oh	O
it	O
sure	O
is	O

to	O
buy	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
plan	O
on	O
being	O
a	O
starving	O
artist	O

that	O
's	O
why	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
college	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
usually	O
because	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

they	O
ca	O
n't	O
afford	O
to	O

a	O
really	O
good	O

the	O
starving	O
ones	O

there	O
's	O
enough	O

there	O
that	O
if	BE
you	IE

till	O
they	O
were	O
at	O

a	O
year	O

you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
despite	BE_IP
working	C
very	O
easily	O
which	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
i	O
preach	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
mothers	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
chose	O
very	O
very	O
carefully	O
the	O
alternative	O
situations	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
them	O
in	O

some	O
babysitting	O
groups	O

yeah	O
i	O
know	O
it	O
sounds	O
like	O
a	O
rationalization	O

but	O
i	O
really	O
do	O
think	O
sometimes	O
they	O
very	O
early	O
on	O
around	O
lots	O
of	O
other	O
children	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
learn	O
to	O
share	O

they	O
learn	O
not	O
necessarily	O
be	O
the	O
center	O
of	O
attention	O
but	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
they	O
're	O
secure	O

help	O

so	BE_IP
so	C
your	O
wife	O
does	O
she	O
work	O
right	O
now	O

yeah	O

they	O
're	O
still	O
trying	O
to	O
dry	O
out	O

you	O
ever	O
think	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
crime	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
so	O
heinous	O
and	O
so	O
bad	O
that	O
the	O
person	O
who	O

this	O

just	O
does	O
n't	O
deserve	O

in	BE

um-hum	O

yeah	O

see	O
i	O

be	O
made	O
on	BE

on	C
the	C

or	O
they	O

that	O
that	O

that	BE_IP

we	O

or	O
are	O
they	O

is	O
it	O
a	O

is	BE
it	IP
is	C_IP
is	C
designed	O
for	O
punishment	O

the	O
death	O

surely	O
fits	O
in	BE_IP
well	C_IE
with	C_IP
in	C
a	O

situation	O
where	O
you	O
're	O
trying	O
to	O
punish	O

perhaps	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
that	O
we	O
do	O
it	O

but	BE_IP
but	C
in	BE_IP
in	C
theory	O
it	O
fits	O
in	O

and	O
reform	O
system	O
in	O
a	O

if	BE
you	IP
if	C
you	C
put	O
someone	O

you	O
obviously	O

n't	O
reform	O
them	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

it	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
we	O
run	O
it	O

i	O

but	O
i	O

if	O
it	O

really	O
a	O

i	O

i	O

the	O

you	O

they	O

and	O
if	BE

they	O

there	O

i	O

a	BE

it	BE

unfortunately	O
that	O

just	O
about	O
anywhere	O

yeah	O

but	O
that	BE

interesting	O

what	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
really	O

oh	O
my	O
goodness	O

judge	O
recalled	O
i	O
would	O
think	O

that	O
's	O
almost	O
when	O
you	O
kind	O
of	O
wish	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
standardized	O
sentences	O

yeah	O

good	O

you	O
would	O
know	O
the	O
whole	O
world	O
would	O
know	O
what	O
you	O
were	O
facing	O

and	O
then	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
matter	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
deciding	O

well	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
care	O
center	O

i	O
worked	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
all	O
the	O
different	O
areas	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
care	O
center	O

it	BE
is	IP
they	C
can	C
be	O
deceiving	O
to	O
people	O

i	O
did	O
not	O
work	O
there	O
long	O
because	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
handle	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
treatment	O
that	O
the	O
children	O

and	O
this	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
well-known	O
center	O
here	O
in	O
tyler	O
who	O
had	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
centers	O
all	O
over	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
city	O

and	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
one	O
way	O
when	O
the	O
parents	O
were	O
there	O
and	O
be	O
another	O
way	O
when	O
the	O
parents	O
less	O

so	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
do	O
day	O
care	O
centers	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
should	O
make	O
frequent	O
checks	O
and	O
the	O
checking	O
on	O
them	O
when	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
expecting	O
it	O

because	O
they	O
do	BE_IP
do	C
things	O
differently	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
around	O

so	O

um-hum	O

this	O
one	O
was	O
set	O
up	O

they	O
had	O
two	O
teachers	O
to	O
every	O
room	O
sometimes	O
three	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
system	O
like	O
so	O
when	O
you	O
walked	O
in	O
everything	O
looks	O
cool	O

the	O
problem	O
i	O
had	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
show	O
affection	O
to	O
the	O
children	O
enough	O

they	O
did	O
not	O
show	O
them	O
care	O
to	O
these	O
small	O
children	O
who	O
are	O
being	O
left	O

they	O

one	O
time	O
i	O
picked	O
up	O
this	O
little	O
boy	O
who	O
was	O
crying	O

and	O
the	O
owner	O
came	O
and	O
just	O
chewed	O
me	O
up	O
one	O
side	O
down	O
the	O
other	O

did	O
you	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
any	O
children	O
here	O
wanting	O
you	O
to	O
pick	O
them	O
up	O

and	O
i	O
said	O
no	O

child	O
was	O
crying	O
and	O
needed	O
some	O
comfort	O

what	O
is	O
your	O
problem	O

so	O

yes	O

they	BE
did	IP
they	C
had	C
like	O
the	BE_IP
the	C_IE
crawlers	C_IP
the	C
babies	C
that	O

n't	O
walk	O
in	O
one	O

the	O
ones	O
that	O
were	O
starting	O
to	O
walk	O
in	O
one	O

then	O
they	O

like	O
the	O
three	O
three	O
girls	O
upper	O

lower	O
fours	O
upper	O
fives	O
lower	O
fives	O
you	O

just	O
like	O
that	O

you	O

they	O
really	O

them	O

it	O
was	O
just	O
the	O

right	O

they	O
're	O
not	O

right	O

the	BE_IP
their	C
system	O

great	O

but	O
the	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
the	C

just	O
was	O
n't	O
there	O

the	O
one	O
woman	O
that	BE

that	C
did	C
the	O
babies	O
i	O

with	O
her	O

and	O
she	O
was	O
fabulous	O

she	O

every	O
one	O

and	O
you	O

they	O
're	O
just	O
there	O
you	O

going	O
through	O
this	O

which	O
is	O
lousy	O

uh-huh	O

you	O

n't	O
see	O
that	O
much	O

yeah	O

has	O
to	O
be	O
with	O
a	O
day	O

i	O
've	O
never	O

of	O
that	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
new	O
one	O
on	O
me	O

um-hum	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

the	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
kind	O
of	O
looked	O
at	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
you	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
many	O
teachers	O
you	O
have	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
how	O
many	O
kids	O
they	O
have	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
break	O
it	O
up	O

because	O
we	BE
had	IP
we	C
had	C
one	O
that	O
sounds	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
what	O
you	O
were	O
in	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
really	O
good	O
one	O

and	O
in	O
fact	O
it	O
worked	O
out	O
for	O
us	O
because	O
my	O
wife	O
we	O
've	O
kind	O
of	O
bartered	O

my	O
wife	O
did	O
artwork	O
for	O
them	O

then	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
so	C
we	O
got	O
our	O
day	O
care	O
free	O

but	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
enough	O
teachers	O

uh-huh	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

did	O
they	O
separate	O
them	O
by	O
age	O
group	O

because	O
i	BE
think	IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
think	C
that	O
's	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
was	O
important	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

sounds	O
like	O
some	O
of	O
your	BE_IP
your	C
concern	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
loving	O
people	O
affectionate	O
people	O
that	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
're	C
kind	O
of	O
pierre	O
maybe	O
parents	O
themselves	O
or	O
something	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
really	O
important	O
thing	O
because	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
doctorates	O
and	O
p	O
h	O
d	O
's	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
the	O
technical	O
stuff	O

but	O
if	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
reach	O
out	O
and	O
touch	O
the	O
kids	O
than	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
do	O
any	O
good	O

yeah	O

the	O
other	O
group	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O

we	BE
went	IE
to	IE
the	IP
it	C
was	C
a	C
husband	O
and	O
wife	O
team	O
and	O
we	O
knew	O
them	O
from	O
other	O
associations	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
district	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
she	BE
would	IP
she	C
'd	C
put	O
her	O
arm	O
around	O
the	O
kids	O
and	O
talk	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
stuff	O

but	O
he	O
was	O
actually	O
the	BE
more	IP
the	C
more	C
what	O
demonstrative	O
type	O
the	O
more	O
loving	O

he	O
would	O
you	O
know	O
laugh	O
with	O
the	O
kids	O
and	O
play	O
with	O
the	O
kids	O

and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
it	O
was	O
actually	O
the	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
group	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
did	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
it	O

yeah	O

so	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
really	O
nice	O
balance	O

we	O
like	O
that	O
one	O

in	O
fact	O
it	O
was	O
called	O
humpty	O
dumpty	O
play	O
school	O
or	O
something	O

but	O
they	BE
also	IE
did	IP
they	C
also	C
did	C
some	O
of	O
the	O
teaching	O
things	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
had	O

median	BE_IP
obedience	C
was	O
important	O

and	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
so	C
they	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
they	C
used	O
oh	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
use	O

you	O
probably	O
heard	O
where	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
where	C
you	O
stand	O
in	O

your	O

it	BE

it	C

i	O

about	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

i	O

there	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

on	BE_IP
on	C
the	O

you	O

and	O
then	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
not	O
there	O
you	O
know	O

especially	O
since	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
world	O

there	O
was	O
always	O
that	O

on	O

i	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O

things	O
to	O
me	O
recently	O
was	O
you	O
know	O
during	O
the	O
war	O
in	O
kuwait	O
was	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
retaliate	O
for	O
the	O
scud	O
missiles	O
that	O
were	O
launched	O
there	O

it	O
just	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
phenomenal	O
demonstration	O
of	O
restraint	O

it	O
must	O
have	O
reflected	O
some	O
awful	O
good	O
diplomacy	O
on	O
the	O

u	O

you	O

you	O

anything	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

what	O
about	O

they	O

i	O

i	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
have	O

their	O

's	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
you	O

pay	O
for	O
that	O
for	O
the	O

and	O
stuff	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
they	BE
'll	IE
let	IE
you	IP
they	C
'll	C
let	C
you	C
decrease	O
how	O
many	O

you	O

by	O
any	O

you	O

if	BE
you	IE

you	O

decrease	O
your	O
number	O

any	O

just	BE_IP
just	C
about	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
your	O

i	O
think	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
get	O
like	O
a	BE_IP
with	C
your	C
extra	O
degrees	O
you	O
get	O
a	O

too	O

so	O
i	O
would	O
probably	O
help	O
out	O

kind	O
of	O
health	O

type	O
stuff	O

i	BE
think	IP
i	C
mean	C
that	BE
's	IE
pretty	IP
that	C
's	C
pretty	C
important	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
there	O
because	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
can	O
be	O
really	O
expensive	O
if	O
you	O
ever	O
have	O
any	O
health	O

i	O

i	O
'm	O
still	O

them	O
with	O
my	O
dad	O
's	O
health	O
plan	O
at	BE
his	IP
where	C
he	C
works	O

definitely	O
be	O
something	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
i	O
guess	O
once	O
i	O
get	O
my	O
own	O

uh-huh	O

yes	O

well	O
i	BE
think	IE
the	IP
i	C
guess	C
the	C
only	O
real	O

i	O
guess	O
you	O
could	O
say	O
work	O
for	O
me	O
working	O
here	O
besides	O
i	O
mean	O

learning	O
and	O
stuff	O
because	O
i	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
in	O

but	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
some	O
weird	O
law	O
where	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
student	O
employees	O
working	O
for	O
the	O
government	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
social	O

that	O
's	O
about	O
five	O

right	O
there	O

so	O

that	O
's	O
about	O
the	O
only	O
real	O
bonus	O
i	BE
have	IP
so	C
i	C
have	C
to	O
take	O
that	O
into	O
consideration	O
when	O
i	O
evaluate	O
like	O
how	O
much	O
i	O
get	O
paid	O
for	O
it	O
yeah	O
i	O
was	O
working	O
somewhere	O
else	O
i	O
'd	O
have	O
to	O
you	O

an	O
extra	O
five	O
percent	O
or	O
so	O

um-hum	O

yeah	O

oh	O

yeah	O

that	O
would	O
help	O
a	O
lot	O

yeah	O

see	O
around	O
around	O
here	O
it	O
's	O
like	O

pretty	O
much	O
work	O
from	O
project	O

project	O
you	O

that	BE
's	IE

there	C
's	C
not	C
a	O
whole	O

of	O
you	O

from	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
'm	O
working	O
in	O
computer	O

c	O
m	O
u	O

i	O

for	BE
the	IE

the	C

yeah	O

actually	O

um-hum	O

it	O
's	O

there	O
they	O

well	O
i	O

what	O
they	BE_IP
they	C

okay	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
quite	O
as	O
good	O
as	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
significant	O

here	O
is	O
that	O
you	O

two	O

they	O

for	O
carnegie	O

you	O

oh	O

um-hum	O

um-hum	O

sure	O

well	O
i	O
worked	O
for	O
an	O

i	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

that	O
are	O
pretty	O
crazily	O
decided	O
by	O

particularly	O

i	O
know	O
in	O
england	O
the	O
judges	O
set	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
awards	O

you	O
know	O
juries	O
will	O
decide	O
the	O
guilt	O
or	O
innocence	O

but	O
then	O
they	O
leave	O
the	O
awards	O
up	O
to	O
more	O
learned	O
people	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
maybe	O
that	O
avoids	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
totally	O
ridiculous	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
millions	O
and	O
millions	O
of	O
dollars	O

oh	O
exactly	O

each	O
individual	O
jury	O
really	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
perception	O
of	O
what	BE
the	IE
going	IP
you	C
know	C
if	C
you	C
will	C
the	C
going	C
award	C
should	C
be	C
for	O
a	O
certain	O
type	O
of	O
case	O
you	O
know	O
within	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
range	O

when	O
you	O
get	O
one	O
way	O
out	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
then	O
really	O
does	O
n't	O
penalize	O
wind	O
up	O
penalizing	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
after	O

it	O
really	O
penalizes	O
is	O
their	O
insurance	O
company	O
which	O
then	O
translates	O
into	O
higher	O
rates	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
if	O
they	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
mega	O
awards	O
against	O
them	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

to	O

there	O

if	O
they	O
're	O
losing	O
money	O
then	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O

so	O
it	O
all	O
comes	O
filtering	O
down	O
to	O
us	O
all	O
individually	O

and	O

some	O
people	O

to	O
be	O

if	O
they	O
have	O
really	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

you	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

you	O

i	O

that	O
you	O

i	O

you	O

at	O
the	O

the	O

they	O

that	O
they	O
would	O

you	O

you	O

to	O

some	O

there	O

that	O
may	O
be	O
where	O
the	O

is	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
learned	O
about	O
that	O
type	O
of	O

because	O
they	O
could	O
be	O

in	O
that	O

and	O
it	O
could	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

you	O
know	O
to	O

the	O

if	O

somebody	O

a	O

and	O
the	O

's	O

out	O
to	O
that	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
mega	O
awards	O
that	O
really	O
you	O
know	O
ultimately	O
is	O
not	O
penalizing	O
the	O

that	O
they	O
're	O

anyway	O

if	O
it	O
's	O
a	O

you	O

that	O
they	O

unless	O
the	O

so	O

that	O
it	O
goes	O

another	O
pet	O

when	O

i	O

that	BE_IP
that	C

for	BE_IP

where	O

something	O

one	O

something	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
they	O
buy	O

for	O

well	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
talking	O
about	O
any	O

let	O
's	O
say	O
a	O
lumber	O

company	O

and	O
somebody	O
's	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

actually	O
is	O
driving	O
by	BE_IP
with	C
a	O
forklift	O

pushes	O
the	O
wrong	O
but	O

drops	O
a	O
load	O
of	O
lumber	O
on	O
somebody	O

and	O
it	O
injures	O
them	O

sure	O

insurance	O
should	O
pay	O
for	O
that	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
talking	O
about	O
any	O
longer	O

i	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
only	O
losses	O
that	O
are	O
judged	O
for	O
a	O
punitive	O
damage	O
which	O
is	O
another	O
category	O
of	O
the	O
juries	O
are	O
awarding	O
damages	O
these	O
days	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
person	O
's	O
actual	O
injuries	O
and	O
what	O
they	O
do	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
're	O
awarding	O
a	O
second	O
amount	O
as	O
punishment	O
to	O
the	O
company	O
which	O
is	O
usually	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
an	O
amount	O
their	O
designed	O
to	O
sting	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
for	O
their	O
negligence	O
for	O
gross	O
wanton	O
negligence	O
in	O
a	O
claim	O

and	O
unfortunately	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

lately	O
the	O
courts	O
have	O
been	O
deciding	O
that	O
those	O
could	O
be	O

for	O
by	O

too	O

so	O
again	O
i	O
never	O
really	O
penalizes	O
the	O
company	O
doing	O
the	O
wrong	O

they	O
can	O
go	O
right	O
on	O
doing	O
the	O
same	O
old	O
thing	O
they	O
always	O
used	O
to	O

and	O
if	O
they	O
know	O
some	O
practice	O
is	O
wrong	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O

about	O
your	O

more	O
about	O
the	BE_IP
you	C

the	C

that	O
they	O

they	O

something	O

they	O

it	O
even	O
after	O
they	O

then	O
i	O

like	O
you	O

we	O

do	O
you	O

um-hum	O

well	O
we	O
're	O

i	BE

i	C

my	O

working	O

she	O
is	O
taking	O

also	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
have	O

had	O
to	O
look	O
for	O

either	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
nice	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
have	O
like	O
you	O
mentioned	O
a	BE
lot	IE

a	C
lot	C
of	C

there	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
child	O

some	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
critical	O
about	O
is	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
kids	O
that	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
child	O

what	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
guidance	O

to	O
student	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
to	O
child	O
relationship	O
how	O
many	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
thirty	O
or	O
forty	O
kids	O
and	O
only	O
one	O

and	O
something	O

i	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
accommodate	O
or	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
kids	O
very	O
well	O

and	O
they	O
also	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
the	O
kids	O
are	O
being	O
taught	O
not	O
just	O
playing	O
around	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
depends	O
also	O
upon	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
the	O
child	O

yeah	O
we	O
take	O
a	O
very	O
close	O
look	O
at	O
finding	O
a	O
preschool	O
good	O
preschool	O
for	O

kind	O
of	O
relate	O
that	O
to	O
that	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
making	O
sure	O
that	O
the	O

are	O
very	O
well	O
educated	O
themselves	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
good	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
're	O

to	O
teach	O
the	O

and	O
have	O
a	O
fun	O
time	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
important	O
i	O
feel	O
that	O
the	O
kids	O
interact	O
with	O
other	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	O
develop	O
yeah	O

with	O
other	O
kids	O
their	O
age	O
and	O
get	O
to	O

and	O
work	O
with	O
kids	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
guess	O
we	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
in	O
the	O

boat	O

we	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
to	O
look	O
very	O
carefully	O
for	O
child	O

i	O
think	O
is	O
imports	O

you	BE
mentioned	IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
good	O
idea	O
on	O
the	O
parent	O
co-op	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
very	O
concerned	O
about	O
the	O

of	O
my	O
kids	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
just	O
take	O
them	O
to	O
somebody	O
i	O
pick	O
out	O

the	O
yellow	O
pages	O
or	O
out	O
of	O
some	O

somewhere	O

trust	O
the	O
people	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
hear	O
in	O
the	O
newspaper	O
you	O
hear	O
on	O
the	O
t	O
v	O
and	O
you	O
read	O
the	O
newspaper	O
quite	O
often	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
people	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
do	O
n't	O
treat	O
or	O
take	O

of	O
your	O

the	O
way	O
you	O
think	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O

and	O
i	O
hope	O
to	O
never	O
get	O
into	O
that	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
find	O
somebody	O
and	O
hit	O
the	O

someone	O
with	O
the	O

hope	O
that	O
we	O
can	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

well	O
steve	O
it	O
's	O
been	O

well	O
ourselves	O
we	O
have	O
i	O
guess	O
never	O
had	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
child	O
care	O

our	O
kids	O
are	O
no	O
fourteen	O
and	O
eighteen	O

but	BE_IP
and	C
so	C
you	O
know	O
you	O
go	O
back	O
those	O
many	O
years	O

and	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
very	O
much	O

yeah	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
looking	O
at	O
two	O
family	O
income	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
our	O
kids	O
were	O
older	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
you	O
know	O
friends	O
of	O
ours	O
that	O
of	O
use	O
child	O
care	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

so	O
my	O
involvement	O
has	O
n't	O
been	O
direct	O

but	O
still	O
have	O
been	O
you	O
know	O
certainly	O
exposed	O
to	O
criteria	O
people	O
are	O
using	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

right	O

yeah	O

i	O
kind	O
of	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
some	BE
of	IE
our	IE
friends	IP
or	C
even	C
our	C
own	C
children	C
will	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
they	O
may	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
child	O
care	O

even	O
you	O
know	O
here	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
have	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
two	O
forms	O
of	O
child	O
care	O

where	O
individuals	O
will	O
in	O
once	O
it	O
primarily	O
babysit	O
children	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
home	O

and	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
groups	O
of	O
anywhere	O
from	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
to	O
maybe	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
children	O

and	O
then	O
otherwise	O
there	O
will	O
be	O

the	O
majority	O
are	O
cooperative	O
day	O
cares	O

people	O
form	O
a	O
co-op	O
and	O
parents	O
will	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
co-op	O
and	O
put	O
a	O
fair	O
number	O
of	O
hours	O

frequently	O
they	O
will	O
hire	O
staff	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
day	O
care	O

and	O
the	O
emphasis	O
is	O
primarily	O
someplace	O
for	O
the	O
children	O
to	O
be	O

but	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
there	O
's	O
some	O
fairly	O
good	O
training	O
programs	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
formal	O
two	O
year	O
programs	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
some	O
definite	O
creative	O
play	O
good	O
social	O
interaction	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
've	O
even	O
had	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
kinds	O
of	O
situations	O
publicized	O
here	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
typically	O

where	O
there	O
's	O
been	O
child	O
care	O
in	O
a	O
home	O
or	O
in	O
a	O
larger	O
situation	O
where	O
actually	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
of	O
an	O
institution	O

and	O
you	O
've	O
actually	O
got	O
children	O
that	O
most	O
people	O
would	O
consider	O
problem	O
children	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IE
not	IP
it	C
's	C
more	C
of	O
a	O
group	O
home	O
rather	O
than	O
actually	O
day	O
care	O
type	O
of	O
facility	O

so	O

before	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago	O
i	O
had	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
very	O
narrow	O
view	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
nursing	O
homes	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
a	O
funeral	O
home	O

i	O
always	O
joked	O
around	O
about	O
it	O
being	O
a	O
funeral	O
home	O
not	O
really	O
nursing	O
home	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
volunteer	O
work	O
here	O
in	O
tyler	O
texas	O

and	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
one	O

and	O
it	O
just	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
activities	O
director	O

everyone	O
was	O
cheerful	O

and	O
now	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
such	O
a	O
bad	O
view	O
of	O
nursing	O
homes	O
anymore	O

i	O
certainly	O
would	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
send	O
my	O
parent	O
unless	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
absolute	O
last	O

i	O

a	O

you	O

you	O

oh	O

oh	O
okay	O

well	O
i	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O

as	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
they	O

i	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

yeah	O

um-hum	O

i	O

that	O

well	O
i	O

since	O
i	O

you	O

a	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O

anymore	O
either	O

so	O

i	O
've	O
just	O
been	O
real	O
busy	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
lots	O
of	O
other	O
things	O

twenty	O
eight	O

i	O
went	O
to	O

and	O
got	O
a	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
worked	O
for	O
awhile	O

then	O
i	O
just	O

yeah	O

how	O

you	O

okay	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
did	O

my	O

's	O
always	O

you	O

he	O
's	O
probably	O
about	O
fifty	O
three	O
years	O

so	O
he	O

up	O
like	O
in	O
the	O
late	O

you	O
know	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
elvis	O
presley	O

like	O
that	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O

so	O
he	O

that	O

my	O

my	O

though	O

well	O
you	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
grew	O
up	O
listening	O
to	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
can	O
see	O
why	O
you	BE
would	IE
n't	IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
can	C
see	O
why	O
you	O
were	O
kind	O
of	O
shelter	O
i	O
guess	O
from	BE_IP
from	C
music	O

oh	O
okay	O

okay	O

yeah	O

so	O
do	O
i	O

do	O
you	O
like	O
like	O
a	O
van	O
halen	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

how	O
about	O
bryan	O
adams	O

love	O
cuts	O
like	O
a	O
nice	O
summer	O
of	O
69	O

yeah	O

he	O
's	O
from	O
canada	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
watch	O
music	O
television	O
m	O
t	O
v	O
at	O
all	O
or	O
vh1	O

okay	O

yeah	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
get	O
cable	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
cable	O
to	O
get	O
those	O
stations	O
anyhow	O

but	O

i	O
like	O
to	O
watch	O
rock	O
and	O
roll	O
videos	O
and	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O

and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

yeah	O

okay	O

oh	O

so	O
do	O
you	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
firm	O

work	O
for	O
a	O
fairly	O
large	O
company	O

it	O
's	O
got	O
eight	O
thousand	O
people	O

and	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
health	O
insurance	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
four	BE
o	IP
one	C
k	C
plan	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

we	O
do	O
have	O
like	O
retirement	O

they	O
kind	O
of	O
match	O
up	O
to	O
you	O

if	O
you	O
put	O
six	O
percent	O
they	O
match	O
up	O
to	O
six	O
percent	O

and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
his	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
put	O
more	O
than	O
that	O
or	O
something	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
bad	O

god	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
to	O
like	O
twenty	O
five	O
years	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
phone	O
call	O
flex	O
benefits	O
plan	O
where	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
get	O
like	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
dollars	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
spend	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
cafeteria	O
of	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
to	O

otherwise	O
you	O
can	O
because	O
you	O
can	O
put	BE_IP
also	C
put	C
money	O
hold	O
money	O
back	O
and	O
then	O
either	O
use	O
it	O
or	O
lose	O
it	O
and	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
taxed	O
or	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
have	O
that	O
money	O
you	O
know	O
putting	O
your	O
paycheck	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
depends	O
on	O
which	O
company	O
you	O
work	O

i	O
know	O
that	O
like	O
though	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
one	O
plant	O
everyone	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
my	O
place	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
you	BE_IP
they	C
call	O
it	O
plan	O
d	O

the	O
deductibles	O
are	O
really	O
hot	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
fifteen	O
hundred	O
dollars	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
ones	O
are	O
paying	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
for	O
them	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
unlikely	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
relatively	O
hopefully	O
than	O
it	O
is	O
really	O
unlikely	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
that	O
money	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O

so	O
that	O
you	O
when	O
someone	O
did	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
cost	O
benefit	O
analysis	O

ends	O
up	O
the	O
best	O
i	O
take	O
the	O
high	O
deductible	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
take	O
a	O
loss	O
whatever	O
happens	O
to	O
be	O
if	O
you	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
healthy	O
individual	O

i	O
mean	O
not	O
even	O
your	BE_IP
your	C_IP
your	C
car	O
insurance	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
other	O
than	O
the	O
health	O
insurance	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
an	O
extra	O
week	O
of	O
time	O
off	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O

only	O
get	O
two	O
weeks	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
nice	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
them	O
until	O
till	O
your	O
seventh	O
year	O
of	O
service	O
till	O
you	O
get	O
an	O
extra	O
week	O

yeah	O

oh	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
telecommunications	O
type	O
of	O
company	O
supposedly	O
we	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
stable	O

so	O
less	O
stable	O
than	O
usual	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
have	O
job	O

but	O
now	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O

yeah	O

bellcore	O
which	O
is	O

yeah	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
no	O
longer	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
still	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
old	O
model	O

and	O
now	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

but	O
no	BE_IP
no	C
longer	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
so	O

hearing	O
a	O
lot	O

oh	O
they	O
're	O
always	O
laying	O
people	O
off	O
which	O
is	O
another	O

that	O
you	O
can	O

other	O
than	O
salary	O
is	O
trade	O
that	O
off	O
for	O

oh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

we	BE
do	IE
n't	IP
we	C
have	C
n't	C
been	O

we	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
for	O
those	O
people	O

some	O
of	O
it	O

yeah	O

there	O
's	O
too	O
many	O
managed	O
to	O
many	O

and	O
not	O
enough	O
indians	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
about	O
three	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
people	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
large	O
compared	O
to	O
some	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
big	O
enough	O

and	O
they	BE

they	C

any	O

where	O

i	O
wish	O
they	O

you	O

they	O

they	O

at	O
anything	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
deal	O

how	O
long	O
does	O
it	O
take	O
for	O
your	O

to	O
vest	O

yeah	O

place	O
i	O
work	O
as	O
health	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
expensive	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
a	O
hundred	O
bucks	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
something	O
for	O
a	O
family	O

we	O
have	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
use	O
it	O
or	O

it	O

where	O
they	O
'll	O
basically	O
pay	O
for	O
you	O

i	O
can	O

for	O
the	O

i	O

on	O
the	O

the	O
way	O
my	O

julie	O

i	O
'm	O
from	O

i	O
just	O

that	O
everybody	O

it	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O

that	O
you	O

oh	O

they	O
have	O

what	BE
i	IP
what	C
i	C
used	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
grocery	O

which	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
neat	O

but	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
just	O
save	O
up	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
i	O
got	O
one	O

them	O

them	O
the	O

use	O
them	O
over	O
and	O
over	O

but	O
also	O
most	O

i	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
kroger	O
does	O
or	O
not	O

yeah	O

and	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
have	O
like	O
little	BE_IP

that	O
you	O

put	O
your	O

really	O
is	O
a	O
small	O

did	O
you	O

did	O
you	O

that	O

something	O

fifty	O

well	O
it	BE

it	C

it	O

well	O
they	O

yellow	O

you	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O

no	O

uh-huh	O

so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O

about	O
the	O

in	O
atlanta	O

there	O
's	O
big	O

i	O
do	O

if	O
they	O
ever	O

i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
details	O

there	O
should	O

someplace	O
where	O
you	O

out	O

as	O
a	O

i	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
you	O
can	O
call	O
them	O
now	O
the	O
closest	O
you	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
curbside	O
service	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
i	O
could	O
really	O

uh-huh	O

during	O
the	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
them	O
around	O
where	O
i	O
live	O
the	O

i	O

they	O
'll	O
have	O

and	O
i	O
'll	O
go	O
around	O
and	O
collect	O
cans	O
and	O
aluminum	O
stuff	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
used	O
to	O
just	O
save	O
them	O
up	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
'd	O
come	O
around	O

give	O
them	O
to	O
them	O

but	O

during	O
the	O
winter	O
time	O
i	O
think	O
then	O
they	O
move	O
south	O
or	O
something	O
so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
that	O
anymore	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
recycling	O
at	O
georgia	O

outside	O
the	O

they	O
never	O

those	O

they	O
just	O

yeah	O
i	O

yeah	O
that	O
's	O

that	O

that	O

i	O

when	O

listen	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
hear	O
the	O

report	O
or	O
something	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
about	O
the	O
same	O

you	O
know	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
certainly	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
similar	O
charter	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O

and	O
what	BE_IP
what	C_IE
kind	IE
of	IP
what	C
kind	C
of	C
news	O
normally	O
interests	O

what	BE
do	IE
you	IP
what	C_IP
what	C
do	C
you	C
find	O
interesting	O
versus	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
find	O
boring	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
will	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
keep	O
claiming	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
big	O
influence	O

but	O
we	O
've	O
yet	O
to	O
see	O
it	O

it	O
's	O
real	O
short	O
term	O
yet	O
though	O

that	O
's	O
only	O
been	O
three	O
months	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
since	O
that	O
happened	O

but	O
they	O
like	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
important	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
too	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
possibility	O

it	BE_IP
we	C
might	O
also	O
be	O
helped	O
though	O
because	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
easier	O
to	O
do	O
business	O
over	O
there	O
too	O

for	O
the	O
companies	O
that	O
already	O
have	O
a	O
presence	O
over	O
there	O

and	O
i	O
know	O
of	O
at	O
least	O
one	O
company	O
that	O
specifically	O
went	O
over	O
there	O
and	O
established	O
a	O
presence	O
before	O
nineteen	O
ninety	O
two	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
it	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
time	O

yeah	O

because	O
once	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
there	O
then	O
you	O
can	O
easily	O
expand	O

but	O
getting	O
in	O
after	O
nineteen	O
ninety	O
two	O
is	O
more	O
difficult	O

yes	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
already	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
evidence	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
being	O
very	O
protectionist	O

even	O
amongst	O
themselves	O
are	O
being	O
somewhat	O
protectionist	O
you	O
know	O

like	O
england	O
does	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
one	O
thing	O

in	O
sweden	O
does	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
another	O
thing	O

they	BE
're	IP
they	C
've	C
all	O
got	O
their	O
own	O
reasons	O
but	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
resolved	O
yet	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
i	O
mean	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
within	O
those	O
people	O
's	O
minds	O
it	O
's	O
quite	O
justified	O

um-hum	O

before	O
they	O
open	O
up	O
their	O

to	O
everyone	O

what	O
is	O
the	O

do	O
you	O
watch	O
anything	O
like	O
with	O
sports	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

against	O
your	O
will	O

yeah	O

and	O
these	O
guys	O
have	O
a	O
remote	O

it	O
's	O
sometimes	O
better	O
to	O
not	O

one	O
of	O
those	O

you	O
can	O
always	O
mislocate	O
it	O
or	O
misplace	O
it	O
i	O

not	O
mislocate	O
it	O
but	O
misplace	O
it	O

actually	O
no	O

because	BE_IP
because	C
i	O
'm	O
in	O
school	O

i	O
kind	O
of	O
miss	O
out	O
on	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
current	O
events	O

they	O
just	O
catch	O
the	O
major	O
ones	O
off	O
the	O
news	O
or	O
if	O
someone	O
starts	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
watch	O
a	O

it	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
my	O
only	O
major	O

what	O
about	O
you	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
in	O
depth	O

yeah	O

well	O
they	O
're	O
just	O
trying	O
to	O
fill	O
in	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	BE
do	IP
i	C
do	C
too	O

you	O
may	O
find	O
one	O
little	O
news	O
item	O
interesting	O

so	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
hear	O
about	O
it	O

yeah	O
you	O
mention	O
newsweek	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
like	O
u	BE_IP
s	C
news	O
and	O
world	O
report	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
to	O
read	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
i	O
like	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
magazine	O

oh	O
well	O
right	O
now	O
i	O
'm	O
trying	O
to	O
keep	O
abreast	O
of	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
europe	O
you	O
know	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
u	O
s	O
s	O
r	O
satellites	O
breaking	O
off	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
become	O
independent	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
european	O
community	O
coming	O
together	O

that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
affect	O
our	O
economy	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

yeah	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
pretty	O
sure	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
it	BE_IP
once	C_IP
once	C
europe	O
becomes	O
unified	O
and	O
the	O
economy	O
becomes	O
one	O
big	O
economy	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
kind	O
of	O
hurt	O

definitely	O

oh	O
yes	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
toehold	O

because	O
when	O
they	O
first	O
start	O
off	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
highly	O
protectionist	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
can	O
understand	O
that	O

they	BE
just	IP
they	C
're	C
starting	O
off	O

and	O
our	O
economy	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
weak	O

so	O
do	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
established	O
before	O
they	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

actually	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
into	O
sports	O

my	O
roommates	O
are	O

unfortunately	O
forced	O
to	O
watch	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
sports	O

yeah	O

fight	O
over	O
the	O
remote	O
control	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
anybody	O
pays	O
too	O

you	O
got	O
to	O
hit	O
up	O
for	O
local	O
taxes	O
there	O

you	O
get	O
the	O
whole	O
smorgasbord	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
actually	O
live	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
tax	O
free	O
or	O
die	O

actually	O
no	O
sales	O
tax	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O

but	O
there	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
very	O
high	O
property	O
taxes	O
because	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
they	O
fund	O
schools	O
and	O
everything	O

the	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
i	O
work	O
in	O
massachusetts	O

they	O
hit	O
me	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
five	O
percent	O
there	O

well	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
only	O
a	O
state	O
taxes	O
no	O
local	O

it	O
's	O
got	O
a	O
five	O
percent	O
sales	O
tax	O

but	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
so	O
i	O
'm	O
paying	O
state	O
tax	O
even	O
though	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
live	O
here	O

but	O
at	O

and	O
things	O
like	O
stock	O
options	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
tax	O
me	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
too	O
bad	O

yeah	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
mean	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'd	C
consider	O
twenty	O
percent	O
lucky	O
because	O
just	O
on	O
i	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
figure	O
out	O
just	O
on	O
feds	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
actually	O
hit	O
the	O
thirty	O
one	O
bracket	O
this	O
which	O
was	O
no	O
fun	O

and	O
also	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
figure	O
out	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
percent	O
for	O
which	O
is	O
taxes	O

most	O
people	O
forget	O
about	O
them	O
because	O
you	BE
've	IE

you	C
know	C
you	C
ca	C
n't	C
like	O
it	O
you	O
pick	O
a	O
back	O

so	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
and	C
then	C
you	O
know	O
like	O
a	O
five	O
cent	O
state	O
that	O
i	O
'm	O
paying	O
forty	O
percent	O
tax	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
people	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
finally	O
are	O
some	O
things	O
where	O
you	O
need	O
infrastructure	O

and	O
you	O
need	O

things	O
government	O
does	O
better	O

the	O
government	O
does	O
a	O
better	O
space	O
program	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
private	O
individuals	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
things	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
tax	O
subsidies	O
tobacco	O
farmers	O
because	O
jesse	O
helms	O
wants	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

you	O
know	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
just	O
tremendous	O
amounts	O
of	O

so	O
much	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
service	O
debt	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
going	O
into	BE_IP
into	C
programs	O
but	O

they	BE
are	IP
they	C
are	C

you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
military	O
is	O
really	O
sad	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
h	O
e	O
w	O
services	O
although	O
they	O
're	O
providing	O
necessary	O
services	O
have	O
too	O
much	O
fat	O
in	O
them	O

i	O
mean	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
spend	O
a	O
fortune	O
for	O
things	O
like	O
v	O
a	O
hospitals	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
how	O
well	O
they	O
're	O
managed	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
we	O
're	O
getting	O
our	O
money	O
's	O
worth	O
it	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
going	O
into	BE_IP
into	C
bureaucrats	O

but	O
between	BE_IP
between	C
him	O
and	O
reagan	O

great	O
communicator	O

yeah	O

oh	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
go	O
until	O
you	O
on	O
that	O

congress	O
they	O
're	O
the	O
fault	O

you	O
know	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
is	O
it	O
's	O
tricky	O
though	O

because	O
like	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
they	O
say	O
oh	O
all	O
right	O
what	O
's	O
cut	O
the	O
military	O
budget	O

then	O
you	O
lose	O
half	O
of	O
your	O
jobs	O
new	O
hampshire	O

grotten	BE_IP
connecticut	C
goes	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IE
like	IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
's	C
very	O
tricky	O
to	O
balance	O
that	O
stuff	O
because	O
then	O
you	O
heard	O
you	O
know	O

if	BE
there	IE
's	IP
if	C
people	C
lose	O
their	O
jobs	O
and	O
they	O
become	O
a	O
load	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

taxes	O

you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
say	O
you	O

this	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
cut	O

who	O
are	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

what	O
's	O
really	O
funny	O
is	O

you	O
really	O
ca	O

get	O
a	O

yeah	O

it	O

a	O

a	O

they	O

there	O
by	O

they	O

once	O
you	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
good	O
to	BE_IP

i	C

just	O

right	O
now	O

he	O
picked	O
up	O
a	O

lately	O

yeah	O

but	O
any	BE_IP
any	C_IP
any	C

it	O
can	O
be	O
bad	O
if	O
you	O

it	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
way	O

in	O
my	O

they	O
just	O

no	O
it	O
's	O

that	BE

i	O

a	O

we	O

her	O
it	O

a	O

you	O

they	BE

they	C
just	C
