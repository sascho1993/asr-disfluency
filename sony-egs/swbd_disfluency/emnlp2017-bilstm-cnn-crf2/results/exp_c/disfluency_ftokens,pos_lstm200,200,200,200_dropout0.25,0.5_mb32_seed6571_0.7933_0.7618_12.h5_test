uh	O
the	O
question	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
trying	O
to	O
put	O
together	O
a	O
uh	O
long	O
term	O
financial	O
plan	O
and	O
monthly	O
budget	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
do	O
now	O
is	O
uh	O
put	O
the	O
data	O
into	O
quicken	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
familiar	O
with	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

um	O
i	O
've	O
found	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
reliable	O
way	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
check	O
book	O
balanced	O
actually	O
because	O
what	O
will	O
happen	O
is	O
my	O
wife	O
will	O
write	O
a	O
few	O
checks	O
and	O
then	O
well	O
uh	O
uh	O
not	O
bother	O
to	O
total	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
it	O
comes	O
in	O
to	O
doing	O
all	O
the	O
arithmetic	O

so	O
it	O
really	O
helps	O
with	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
actually	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
to	O
uh	O
until	O
just	O
recently	O

i	O
guess	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
daughter	O
who	O
is	O
eighteen	O
months	O
and	O
another	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
way	O

so	O
we	O
needed	O
to	O
start	O
doing	O
more	O
of	O
that	O
just	O
for	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
saving	O
for	O
college	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

we	O
tried	O
a	O
way	O
try	O
to	O
put	O
away	O
two	O
and	O
four	O
thousand	O
a	O
year	O
just	O
for	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

um	O
sounds	O
good	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
just	O
at	O
the	O
point	O
uh	O

my	O
wife	O
worked	O
until	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
family	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
now	O
we	O
're	O
just	O
going	O
on	O
the	O
one	O
income	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
interesting	O
trying	O
to	O
uh	O

find	O
some	O
extra	O
payroll	O
deductions	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
we	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
uh	O
do	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
kind	O
of	O
enforce	O
the	O
savings	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O

um	O

um	O

that	O
sounds	O
good	O

but	O
uh	O
uh	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
curious	O
what	O
uh	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

oh	O
okay	O

uh	O
cincinnati	O
actually	O

i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
wondering	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
collecting	O
people	O
with	O
uh	O
the	O
western	O
accents	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
many	O
people	O
are	O
uh	O
getting	O
involved	O
in	O
this	O

but	O
uh	O
well	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

i	BE
'm	IP
uh	C
uh	C
actually	C
uh	C
i	C
was	C
kind	O
of	O
interested	O
if	O
you	O
found	O
out	O
about	O
the	O
study	O
by	O
uh	O
reading	O
telecom	O
digest	O

or	O
was	O
there	O
another	O

oh	O
okay	O

yeah	O

that	O
is	O
how	O
i	O
got	O
it	O
as	O
well	O

but	O
uh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
data	O
base	O

so	O
well	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
talking	O
about	O
the	O
experiment	O

uh	O
probably	O
need	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
topic	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
talk	O
about	BE
finances	IP
without	C_IP
without	C
getting	O
to	O
uh	O
dollar	O
figures	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
know	O

we	O
could	O
talk	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
range	O
goals	O

and	O

uh	O
well	O
i	O
think	O
either	O
my	O
wife	O
or	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
pursue	O
advanced	O
degrees	O
at	O
some	O
point	O

uh	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
factor	O
that	O
in	O
if	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
working	O
for	O
employers	O
that	O
happen	O
to	O
fund	O
that	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O
every	O
year	O
my	O
employer	O
just	O
gives	O
back	O
you	O
know	O
a	BE
little	IE
bit	IP
your	C
tuition	C
reimbursement	C

i	O
mean	O
they	O
use	O
to	O
reimburse	O
one	O
hundred	O
percent	O

and	O
now	O
it	BE
's	IP
uh	C
now	C
it	C
's	C
reimbursement	O
depending	O
on	O
the	O
grade	O
you	O
get	O
in	O
class	O

and	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
real	O
shame	O
from	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
uh	O
because	O
we	O
're	O

yeah	O

i	O
have	O
some	O
friends	O
of	O
mine	O
who	O
use	O
quicken	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
've	O
considered	O
using	O
it	O
once	O
myself	O

but	O
i	O
decided	O
that	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
information	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
keeping	O
that	O
up	O
to	O
date	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
gave	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
using	O
quicken	O
at	O
least	O
for	O
now	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
similar	O
problems	O

but	O
uh	O
we	O
just	O
have	O
the	O
one	O
check	O
book	O

and	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
date	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O

and	O
occasionally	O
we	O
will	O
get	O
behind	O
like	O
you	O
say	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
too	BE_IP
too	C
tight	O
if	O
we	O
just	O
remember	O
to	O
keep	O
everything	O
up	BE_IP
up	C
to	O
date	O
and	O
balanced	O

well	O
how	O
to	O
you	O
handle	O
that	O
the	O
long	O
range	O
or	O
medium	O
range	O
planning	O
on	O
finances	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
know	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
daughter	O
who	O
's	O
ten	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
really	O
put	O
much	O
away	O
for	O
her	O
college	O
up	O
to	O
this	O
point	O

but	O
uh	O
we	O
're	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
now	O
where	O
our	O
financial	O
income	O
is	O
enough	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
consider	O
putting	O
some	O
away	O
for	O
college	O

so	O
we	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
starting	O
a	O
regular	O
payroll	O
deduction	O
in	O
the	O
fall	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
i	O
will	O
be	O
making	O
this	O
summer	O
we	O
'll	O
be	O
putting	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
college	O
fund	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
our	O
situation	O
is	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
opposite	O
of	O
that	O
cause	O
my	O
wife	O
was	O
not	O
working	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
and	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
school	O
and	O
just	O
recently	O
uh	O
took	O
on	O
a	O
full	O
time	O
job	O
well	O
almost	O
full	O
time	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
only	O
recently	O
that	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
the	O
money	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
start	O
putting	O
away	O
large	O
sums	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
uh	O
long	O
range	O
goals	O
like	O
college	O
and	O
sickness	O
and	O
travel	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

oh	O
stockton	O

how	O
about	O
you	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
a	O
colleague	O
of	O
mine	O
at	O
uh	O
work	O
got	O
some	O
information	O
over	O
uh	O
the	O
computer	O
network	O
called	O
internet	O

and	O
he	O
just	O
forwarded	O
that	O
on	O
to	O
me	O

and	O
uh	O
it	O
sounded	O
like	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
interesting	O
project	O
to	O
participate	O
in	O

so	O
i	O
sent	O
back	O
mail	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
what	O
other	O
long	O
range	O
goals	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
besides	O
college	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
uh	O
about	O
putting	O
the	O
elderly	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

huh	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

huh	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

i	O
never	O
thought	O
of	O
that	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

until	O
they	O
get	O
over	O
that	O
hump	O
of	O
whatever	O
it	O
is	O
they	O
're	O
dealing	O
with	O

yes	O

they	O
really	O
are	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
longer	O
than	O
a	O
week	O

yeah	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
mean	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
depends	O
on	O
how	BE_IP
how	C
sick	O
the	O
person	O
is	O
too	O
what	O
you	O
're	O
capable	O
of	O
like	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
family	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
of	C
your	O
own	O

yeah	O

uh	O
i	O
would	O
personally	O
like	O
it	O

if	O
my	O
parents	O
were	O
to	O
get	O
ill	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
home	O
and	O
if	O
i	O
had	O
the	O
money	O
with	O
some	O
help	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
always	O
possible	O

but	O
uh	O
to	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
my	O
ability	O
i	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
until	O
it	O
gets	O
impossible	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
nursing	O
homes	O
can	O
be	O
good	O

it	O
just	O
depends	O
on	O
what	O
kind	O
they	O
are	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
check	O
them	O
out	O
ahead	O
of	O
time	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
they	O
're	O

yeah	O

right	O

who	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
doing	O
with	O
that	O

yeah	O

well	O
my	O
uh	O
grandmother	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
but	O
a	O
retirement	O
home	O
that	O
also	O
has	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O
sort	O
of	O
attached	O
to	O
it	O

and	O
she	O
really	O
liked	O
the	O
idea	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
moving	O
there	O

she	O
's	O
not	O
ill	O
yet	O

but	O
uh	O
she	O
worked	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
volunteer	O
for	O
about	O
ten	O
years	O

and	O
then	O
she	O
decided	O
that	O
uh	O
she	O
's	O
eighty	O
five	O
years	O
old	O
that	O
eventually	O
you	O
know	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
does	O
n't	O
want	O
her	O
family	O
taking	O
care	O
of	O
her	O
and	O
being	O
a	O
burden	O

she	O
's	O
very	O
independent	O

so	O
she	O
's	O
in	O
this	O
nursing	O
home	O

it	O
's	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
country	O

and	O
uh	O
she	O
really	O
enjoys	O
it	O
right	O
now	O
because	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
wash	O
dishes	O
or	O
cook	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

some	O
support	O

and	O
then	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
uh	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
wing	O
for	O
those	O
people	O
that	O
do	O
get	O
sick	O

and	O
what	O
i	O
like	O
about	O
it	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
she	O
likes	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
she	O
knows	O
everybody	O
there	O
now	O

and	BE
then	IP
so	C
if	O
she	O
ever	O
does	O
become	O
ill	O
uh	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
like	O
family	O
around	O
her	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

sh-	O

uh-huh	O

no	O

she	O
loves	O
it	O

she	O
has	O
a	O
great	O
social	O
life	O

and	O
she	O
travels	O

and	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
in	BE_IP
in	C_IE
the	C_IP
very	C
in	C
the	C
mountains	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
beautiful	O

and	O
uh	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
hope	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
when	O
i	O
get	O
older	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
definitely	O
it	O
's	O

right	O

okay	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
varies	O
on	BE_IP
on	C
the	O
individual	O
basis	O

uh	O
sometimes	O
it	BE
is	IP
there	C
is	C
no	O
alternative	O

uh	O
you	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
uh	O
uh	O
family	O
available	O
or	O
family	O
that	O
's	O
uh	O

you	O
may	O
not	O
even	O
have	O
family	O
that	O
is	O
uh	O
uh	O
in	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
who	C
are	C
around	O

so	O
sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
an	O
alternative	O

and	BE
i	IE
think	IP
uh	C
but	C
i	C
think	C
also	O
sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
uh	O
a	O
benefit	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
time	O

sometimes	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

uh	O
especially	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
it	O
's	O
after	O
an	O
acute	O
illness	O

to	O
get	O
over	O
a	O

or	O
to	O
rehab	O
after	O
uh	O
an	O
illness	O

sometimes	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
sometimes	C
the	O
nursing	O
homes	O
are	O
good	O
for	O
uh	O
just	O
short	O
periods	O
of	O
time	O

uh-huh	O

because	O
too	O
often	O
the	O
acute	O
hospitals	O
will	BE_IP
are	C
sending	O
them	O
out	O
much	O
faster	O
than	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
really	O
able	O
to	O

so	BE_IP
so	C
there	O
is	O
some	O
good	O
to	O
it	O

uh	O
sometimes	O
too	O
it	O
's	O
used	O
as	O
a	O
dumb	O
job	O

you	O
know	O
the	BE
fam-	IP
well	C
the	C
families	C
do	O
not	O
necessarily	O
uh	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
responsibility	O

so	O
they	O
will	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
you	O
see	O
uh	O

there	O
's	O
both	O
sides	O
to	O
it	O
too	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
also	O
where	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
going	O
to	O

it	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
not	O
a	O
choice	O
it	O
's	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
economically	O
feasible	O
even	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

so	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
option	O
sometimes	O
is	O
not	O
available	O
if	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
uh	O
either	O
medicare	O
or	O
insurance	O
to	O
cover	O
it	O

so	O

yeah	O

and	O
then	O
there	O
's	O
also	O
some	O
that	O
are	O
set	O
up	O
for	O
specialties	O

uh	O
i	O
know	O
some	O

unfortunately	O
some	O
elderly	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
or	O
have	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
alzheimer	O
's	O
or	O
where	O
they	O
wonder	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
uh	O
confused	O
or	O
have	O
some	O
mental	O
problem	O

and	O
you	O
need	O
a	O
special	O
nursing	O
home	O
for	O
that	O

you	O
need	O
one	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
unit	O
that	O
's	O
locked	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
and	O
roam	O
around	O

and	O
you	O
need	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
trained	O
for	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
problem	O

yeah	O

so	BE_IP
so	C
there	O
's	O
different	O
types	O
of	O
nursing	O
homes	O
i	O
think	O

uh-huh	O

gives	O
her	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
her	O
own	O
independence	O

but	O
she	O
still	O
has	O
uh	O
a	O
security	O
there	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
seen	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
like	O
that	O
too	O

and	O
also	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
uh	O
activities	O
going	O
on	O
for	O
the	O
ones	O
who	O
are	O
more	O
active	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
sort	O
of	O
like	O
uh	O
uh	O
a	O
sick	O
place	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
think	C_IE
i	C_IE
think	C_IE
the	C_IP
uh	C
i	C
think	C
that	C
the	C
decision	O
that	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
though	O
on	O
nursing	O
home	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
joint	O
one	O
between	O
the	O
uh	O
elderly	O
uh	O
person	O
who	O
's	O
going	O
in	O
and	O
the	O
family	O
that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
uh	O
effec-	O
effected	O
by	O
it	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
those	BE
choi-	IP
those	C
choices	C
can	O
be	O
made	O
in	O
advance	O

and	O
sometimes	O
the	O
choices	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
illness	O
when	O
they	O
're	O

so	O
uh	O
do	O
you	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
firm	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
fairly	O
large	O
company	O

it	O
's	O
got	O
eight	O
thousand	O
people	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
health	O
insurance	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
four	O
o	O
k-	O
one	O
k	O
plan	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
like	O
retirement	O

they	O
kind	O
of	O
match	O
up	O
to	O
you	O

if	O
you	O
put	O
six	O
percent	O
they	O
match	O
up	O
to	O
six	O
percent	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
rest	O
is	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
if	O
you	O
put	O
more	O
than	O
that	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
bad	O

god	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
probably	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
till	O
like	O
twenty-five	O
years	O
thirty	O
years	O

yeah	O

huh	O
well	O
i	O
guess	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
is	O
like	BE
a	IE
f-	IP
what	C
they	C
call	C
a	C
flex	C
benefits	O
plan	O
where	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
get	O
like	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
dollars	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
spend	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
cafeteria	O
of	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
or	O
need	O

otherwise	O
you	BE
can	IP
uh	C
guess	C
you	C
can	C
put	BE_IP
also	C
put	C
money	O
hold	O
money	O
back	O
and	O
then	O
either	O
use	O
or	O
lose	O
it	O
and	O
that	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
taxed	O
or	O
can	O
just	O
have	O
that	O
money	O
you	O
know	O
put	O
in	O
your	O
paycheck	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
depends	O
on	O
which	O
company	O
you	O
work	O
for	O

i	O
know	O
that	O
like	O
the	BE_IP
the	C_IP
the	C
one	O
plan	O
that	O
everyone	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
my	O
place	O
is	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
uh	O
think	O
you	O
call	O
it	O
plan	O
d	O

deductibles	O
are	O
really	O
high	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
fifteen	O
hundred	O
dollars	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
ones	O
you	O
're	O
paying	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
for	O
them	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
unlikely	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
f-	O
relatively	O
uh	O
healthy	O
then	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
unlikely	O
that	O
you	O
'd	O
use	O
that	O
much	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
the-	BE_IP
it	C_IP
you	C
know	C
someone	C
did	O
start	O
a	O
cost	O
benefit	O
analysis	O

and	O
ends	O
up	O
the	O
best	O
is	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
high	O
deductible	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
take	O
a	O
loss	O
what-	O
whatever	O
it	O
happens	O
to	O
be	O
if	O
you	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
healthy	O
individual	O

um	O

really	O

you	O
mean	O
not	O
even	O
your	BE_IP
your	C_IP
your	C
car	O
insurance	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
too	O
bad	O

yeah	O

uh	O
well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
other	O
than	O
health	O
insurance	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
an	O
extra	O
week	O
of	O
uh	O
time	O
off	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O

i	O
only	O
get	O
two	O
weeks	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
nice	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
them	O
till	O
till	O
your	O
seventh	O

of	O

till	O
you	O
get	O
an	O
extra	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
uh	O

uh	O
with	O
the	O
telecommunications	O
type	O
of	O
company	O
supposedly	O
you	O
used	O

it	O
's	O
a	O

less	O

they	O

yeah	O

it	O

the	O

i	O

it	BE

uh	O
no	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
what	O

i	O

it	O
's	O
still	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
old	O

of	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
now	O
they	O

uh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

but	O
they	O
no	BE_IP
no	C

i	O

uh	O
hearing	O
a	O
lo-	O

there	BE

about	O
three	O

that	O

it	O

because	O

you	O

no	BE_IP
no	C
insurance	O

happened	O
to	O
cover	O
it	O
which	O
is	O

well	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
got	O
all	O

up	O
because	O
i	O

the	O

and	O
blew	O
it	O

oh	O
well	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

my	O
place	O
you	O
get	O
two	O
weeks	O
when	O
you	O

and	O
then	O
every	BE_IP
every	C

they	O

you	O
an	O

until	O
you	O
've	O

aye	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
long	O

yeah	O

especially	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
engineering	O
job	O
i	O

in	O
you	O

do	O
n't	O
stay	O

that	O
long	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
they	O

so	O
you	O
work	O
for	O

or	O
something	O

that	O

right	O

right	O

a	O
lifelong	O
job	O

telephone	O
pioneers	O
of	O
america	O

all	O
that	O
stuff	O
huh	O

right	O

is	BE
it	IP
i	C
mean	C
does	C
it	C

they	O
must	O
have	O
pretty	O
good	O
severance	O
though	O
huh	O

mean	O
the	BE_IP
the	C_IP
the	C
management	O
they	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O

um	O

oh	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
put	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
one	O
uh	O
advantage	O
of	O
having	O
uh	O
the	O
unanimous	O
verdict	O
is	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
criminal	O
case	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
uh	O
convict	O
someone	O
who	O
uh	O
really	O
should	O
n't	O
be	O
convicted	O

um	O
and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
unanimous	O
verdict	O
uh	O
helps	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O

i	O
guess	O
maybe	O
one	O
drawback	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
one	O
juror	O
who	O
is	O
very	O
unreasonable	O
in	O
some	O
way	O
that	O
uh	O
you	O
uh	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
n't	O
convict	O
someone	O
who	O
maybe	O
should	O
be	O
convicted	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O
before	O

oh	O
okay	O

uh	O
what	O
sorts	O
of	O
cases	O
were	O
they	O

so	O
were	O
they	O
criminal	O
or	O
civil	O

oh	O
okay	O

what	BE_IP
uh	C
what	C
was	O
the	O
verdict	O

did	BE
the	IP
did	C
the	C
jury	O
have	O
trouble	O
reaching	O
a	O
decision	O

yeah	O

so	O
did	O
it	O
become	O

yeah	O

uh	O

uh	O
but	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
civil	O
case	O
it	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
matter	O
right	O

you	O
just	O
needed	O
a	O
majority	O

what	BE
was	IP
what	C
was	C
the	O
other	O
case	O

that	O
was	O
also	O
civil	O

yeah	O

oh	O
did	O
n't	O
really	O
even	O
count	O

yeah	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	O
college	O
student	O

so	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
jury	O
eligible	O
age	O
for	O
very	O
long	O

um	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
did	O
get	O
one	O
summons	O
actually	O
at	O
one	O
point	O

but	O
i	O
declined	O
it	O
which	O
i	O
'm	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
because	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
student	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
uh	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
time	O

yeah	O
i	O
mean	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
really	C_IP
i	C
would	O
like	O
to	BE_IP
uh	C
to	C
do	O
at	O
some	O

um	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
have	O
n't	O

uh	O
one	BE_IP
one	C
thing	O
that	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
think	C_IE
is	C_IP
um	C
you	C
know	C
maybe	C
is	C
a	O
problem	O
is	O
uh	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
the	O
criminal	O
jury	O
system	O
works	O
pretty	O
well	O
now	O

but	O
i	O
wonder	O
if	O
maybe	O
in	O
some	O
civil	O
cases	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
work	O
as	O
well	O

especially	O
sort	O
of	O

how	O
wha-	O

uh	O
you	O
thought	O
it	O
turned	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O

yeah	O

oh	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
zoo	O

and	O
the	O
jurors	O
just	O
sort	O
of	O

someone	O
had	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O

um	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

did	BE
it	IP
did	C
it	C
work	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O
in	O
the	O
end	O

i	O
mean	O
did	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
people	O
sort	O
of	O
gradually	O
sort	O
of	O
assume	O
uh	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
moderator	O

in	O
the	O

or	O

so	O
it	BE
work-	IP
it	C
did	C
end	O
up	O
working	O
out	O
pretty	O
well	O

the	O
one	O
thing	O
i	O
sometimes	O
wonder	O
about	O
um	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
is	O
uh	O
whether	BE_IP
especially	C_IE
sort	C_IE
of	C_IE
in	C_IP
uh	C
maybe	C
like	C
pro-	O
product	O
liability	O
or	O
medical	O
malpractice	O
where	O
there	O
's	O
um	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
technical	O
decision	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
sometimes	O

you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
just	O
a	O
matter	O
of	BE_IP
um	C_IE
of	C_IP
you	C
know	C
did	C
this	O
guy	O
rip	O
off	O
this	O
guy	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
interpreting	O
a	O
contract	O

it	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
sometimes	O
getting	O
into	O
very	O
technical	O
issues	O

and	O
i	O
wonder	O
if	BE_IP
uh	C_IE
if	C_IP
there	IE
's	IE
really	IP
um	C
if	C
the	C
system	C
works	O
adequately	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
educating	O
the	O
jurors	O
about	O
uh	O
whatever	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
issue	O
is	O
under	O
discussion	O

in	BE_IP
in	C
the	O
case	O
you	BE
were	IE
involved	IE
in	IP
you	C
said	C
it	C
was	C
just	C
sort	O
of	O
a	O
bank	O
matter	O
of	O
some	O
kind	O

so	O

yeah	O

uh	O

oh	O
so	O
the	O
deal	O
was	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
uh	O
borrowed	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
bank	O
to	O
buy	O
it	O

and	O
he	O
had	O
n't	O
made	O
the	O
payments	O

yeah	O

uh	O
so	O
they	O
were	O
suing	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
back	O

uh	O

yeah	O

uh	O

definitely	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
i	O
have	O
twice	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
pretty	O
wild	O
experience	O

they	O
were	O
just	O
you	O
know	O
small	O
time	O
cases	O
where	O
uh	O
trailers	O
and	O
banks	O
were	O
involved	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
were	O
civil	O

they	BE
were	IE
n't	IP
they	C
were	C
n't	C
any	O
criminal	O

uh	O
the	O
jury	O
it	BE
was	IP
uh	C
let	C
me	C
see	C
i	C
think	C
it	C
was	C
ten	O
to	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O
because	O
they	O
only	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
eleven	O
people	O

so	O
it	O
was	O

they	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
one	O
changed	O
his	O
vote	O
at	O
the	O
end	O

so	O
it	O
became	O
unanimous	O
you	O
know	O
after	O
they	O
turned	O
it	O
in	O

and	O
then	O
he	O
changed	O
his	O
mind	O
after	O
they	O
turned	O
it	O
in	O

but	O
it	O
then	O
became	O
unanimous	O

right	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
other	O
case	O
was	O
just	O
traffic	O

the	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
seat	O
belt	O
law	O

and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
did	O
n't	O
even	O
hardly	O
go	O
through	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
you	O
learn	O
a	O
lot	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
juries	O
like	O
that	O
though	O

i	O
would	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
i	O
mean	O
from	BE_IP
from	C_IP
my	IP
from	C
what	C
i	C
experienced	O
in	O
them	O

it	BE
did	IE
n't	IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
did	C
n't	C
turn	O
out	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
planned	O
it	O
i	O
mean	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
i	O
would	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
go	O

yeah	O

but	O
it	BE
was	IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
was	C

jury	O
was	O
unorganized	O

and	O
it	BE
was	IP
it	C_IE
was	C_IE
just	C_IP
was	C
n't	C
organized	O
enough	O
for	O
me	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
used	O
to	O
it	O
not	O
being	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
assumed	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O

that	O
's	O
about	O
what	O
it	O
was	O

yeah	O

they	BE_IP
well	C
they	C
picked	O
one	O
person	O

and	O
then	O
he	O
finally	O
you	O
know	O
moderated	O
everything	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
turn	O
out	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
should	O
have	O

yeah	O

it	O
ended	O
up	O
working	O
all	O
right	O

yes	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
they	BE_IP
they	C_IP
they	C
educate	O
them	O
enough	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
really	O
know	O
what	O

going	O
on	O

yeah	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
bank	O
was	O
suing	O
them	O
for	BE_IP
uh	O
because	O
they	O
went	O
to	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

that	O
which	O
was	O
uh	O
seemingly	O
their	O
property	O

it	O

right	O

so	O
they	O

and	O
then	O
when	O

they	BE

they	O

yes	O

i	O
actually	O
get	O

about	IP
just	C
about	C
the	O

except	O
the	O
three	O

uh	O
no	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
have	O
a	O

at	O
the	O

uh	O
but	O
i	BE

uh	C
i	C
have	C
a	O
rough	O
feel	O
for	O
how	O
much	O
money	O
i	O
can	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
do	BE
n't	IP
usually	C

that	O
unless	BE

unless	C
the	C

for	O
one	O

or	O
another	O

and	O
then	O
that	O
then	O
it	O

so	O

yeah	O

so	O
uh	O
what	O

yo-	O

so	O
you	O

yeah	O

so	O
what	O

your	O

there	O

with	BE_IP
with	C
what	O

they	BE_IP
uh	C
they	C

an	O

uh	O
in	BE_IP
in	C

there	BE_IP
there	C_IE

uh	C
you	C

there	C
was	C
a	O
fairly	O
large	O
building	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IP

well	C
that	C

so	O
uh	O
are	BE
you	IP
uh	C
are	C
you	C
uh	O
active	O
in	O
translation	O

uh-huh	O

true	O

uh	O
what	BE_IP
what	C_IP
uh	C
what	C
languages	O
do	O
you	O
speak	O
besides	O
english	O
of	O

uh-huh	O

in	O
france	O

uh	O

must	O
have	O
been	O
terrible	O

the	O
uh	O

was	O
it	O
henry	O
macon	O
said	O
that	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
uh	O
language	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
man	O
slowly	O
bleeding	O
to	O
death	O

so	O
they	O
hemorrhaged	O
him	O
to	O
death	O
without	O
new	O
infusions	O
that	O
will	O
eventually	O
die	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
it	C
just	O
amazes	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
french	O
do	O
n't	O
recognize	O
that	O

free	O
style	O
english	O
is	O
just	O

takes	O
on	O

how	O
about	O
you	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
with	O
your	O
budget	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O

we	BE
're	IE
trying	IP
we	C
're	C
trying	C
to	O
uh	O

so	O
far	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
clear	O
credit	O
wise	O

but	O
uh	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
is	O

so	O
not	O
much	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
add	O
to	O
it	O

we	O
're	O
trying	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
put	O
away	O
some	O
savings	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

but	O

yeah	O

we	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
some	O
day	O

we	O
have	O
this	O
dream	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
long	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
dream	O

we	BE_IP
we	C_IE
're	C_IE
kind	C_IE
of	C_IE
real	C_IP
we	C
're	C
real	C
happy	C
that	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
debt	O

but	O
we	BE
're	IP
at	C
the	C
same	C
time	C
we	C
're	C
real	O
scared	O
about	O
incurring	O
it	O
in	O
this	O
uh	O
economy	O
right	O
now	O

so	O
we	O
're	O
stepping	O
real	O
careful	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
's	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
save	O
what	O
the	O
little	O
bit	O
that	O
we	O
do	O
get	O
you	O
know	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
expenses	O
every	O
month	O

we	O
're	O
missionaries	O
actually	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
uh	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
easier	O
once	O
we	O
get	O
overseas	O
cause	O
we	O
have	O
uh	O
like	O
uh	O
uh	O
support	O
quota	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
cheaper	O
to	O
live	O
overseas	O
than	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
live	O
here	O

and	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
switched	O
very	O
easily	O
once	O
you	O
come	O
home	O

so	O

africa	O

nigeria	O

yeah	O

about	O
four	O
years	O

we	O
're	O
career	O

so	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
go	O
over	O
seas	O
for	O
four	O
years	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
come	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
year	O

we	O
go	O
over	O
four	O

we	O
come	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
year	O

uh	O
we	O
're	O
with	O
wycliff	O
bible	O
translators	O

so	O

yeah	O

they	O
could	O
very	O
well	O

and	O

uh	O
we	O
will	O
be	O

i	O
was	O
over	BE_IP
over	C
four	O
years	O
doing	O
language	O
surveying	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
step	O

you	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
the	O
scout	O
that	O
goes	O
ahead	O
of	O
the	O
team	O
and	O
assesses	O
the	O
need	O

and	O
uh	O
came	O
home	O
and	O
got	O
married	O

and	O
we	O
will	O
go	O
ba-	O
back	O
as	O
translators	O
cause	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
raise	O
a	O
family	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
easier	O
to	O
raise	O
a	O
family	O
as	O
translators	O

well	O
i	O
always	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
translation	O

but	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
i	O
was	O
single	O
and	O
foot	O
loose	O
so	O
to	O
speak	O
it	O
's	O
easier	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
really	O
need	O
surveyors	O
cause	O
you	BE
could	IP
you	C
're	C
free	O
to	O
travel	O
anywhere	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
kids	O
hanging	O
around	O
you	O
and	O
stuff	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
smattering	O
of	O
about	O
ten	O
different	O
ones	O

but	O
there	O
's	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
bilingual	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
because	O
i	O
kept	O
switching	O
from	O
one	O
area	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
you	O
know	O

since	O
i	O
did	O
you	O
know	O
complete	O
a	O
survey	O
in	O
one	O
area	O
i	O
'd	O
switch	O
to	O
the	O
other	O

so	O
i	O
know	O
the	O
greetings	O
in	O
about	O
ten	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
market	O
stuff	O

but	O
in	O
about	BE_IP
uh	C
about	C
five	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
can	O
do	O
better	O
in	O
it	O

and	O
my	O
french	O
is	O
pretty	O
good	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
french	O

so	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
terrified	O
to	O
speak	O
in	BE_IP
uh	C
in	C
france	O

yeah	O

because	O
they	O
're	O
real	O
snobby	O
about	O
their	O
language	O

and	O
french	O
is	O
street	O
french	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
picked	O
it	O
up	O
off	O
the	O
street	O

and	O
i	BE
knew	IE
what	IE
i	IE
was	IP
i	C
knew	C
what	O
i	O
was	O
communicating	O

but	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
i	O
was	O
saying	O

i	O
never	O
sat	O
there	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
direct	O
translation	O

and	O
said	O
something	O
here	O
when	O
i	O
came	O
home	O
and	O
french	O
to	O
somebody	O

and	O
he	O
paled	O
and	O
said	O
uh	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
what	O
you	O
said	O

so	O
since	O
then	O
i	O
have	O
refrained	O
from	O
speaking	O
any	O
french	O

so	O

in	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

what	O
i	O
said	O
to	O
him	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O

uh	O

i	O
have	O
n't	O
heard	O
her	O

oh	O
okay	O

oh	O
really	O

hello	O
ann	O

uh	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
i	O
attended	O
a	O
conference	O
here	O
at	O
utah	O
state	O
university	O
on	O
recycling	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
interested	O
to	O
hear	O
cause	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
people	O
from	O
the	O
e	O
p	O
a	O
and	O
lots	O
of	O
different	O
places	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O
had	O
basically	O
decided	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
real	O
problem	O
here	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
on	O
solid	O
waste	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
too	O
new	O

oh	O
they	O
really	O
did	O
n't	O
propose	O
any	O
solutions	O

actually	O
they	BE
were	IP
the	C
guy	C
was	C
pretty	O
negative	O
about	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
was	O
doing	O
even	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
from	O
the	O
e	O
p	O
a	O

but	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
uh	O
facts	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
give	O
and	O
uh	O
things	O
like	O
how	O
many	O
solid	O
waste	O
plants	O
were	O
being	O
shut	O
down	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
uh	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
things	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
was	O
recycling	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
news	O
print	O

he	O
was	O
talking	O
about	O
uh	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
new	O
york	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
went	O
and	O
collected	O
all	O
this	O
news	O
print	O

and	O
they	O
could	O
sell	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
while	O

they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
sell	O
it	O
for	O
some	O
amount	O
per	O
ton	O

and	O
now	O
at	O
this	O
stage	O
of	O
the	O
game	O
where	O
they	O
have	O
gotten	O
into	O
recycling	O
they	O
've	O
collected	O
so	O
much	O
news	O
print	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
hauled	O
away	O

yeah	O

we	O
're	O
doing	O
some	O
here	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
cash	O
valley	O
the	O
community	O
here	O

there	BE
's	IP
uh	C
we	C
've	C
actually	O
got	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
nice	O
set	O
up	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
plants	O
here	O
that	O
actually	O
take	O
uh	O
recycled	O
paper	O
and	O
shred	O
it	O
and	O
spray	O
it	O
with	O
chemical	O
treatment	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
fire	O
hazard	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
into	O
insulation	O

and	O
they	O
can	O
actually	O
use	O
as	O
much	O
recycled	O
paper	O
as	O
the	O
community	O
can	O
get	O
to	O
them	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
actually	O
buying	O
it	O
and	O
shipping	O
it	O
in	O
from	O
outside	O

so	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
real	O
keys	O
it	O
sounds	O
like	O
to	O
getting	O
recycling	O
for	O
uh	O
paper	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
to	O
go	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
business	O
to	O
actually	O
want	O
it	O
once	O
you	O
have	O
collected	O
it	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
paper	O
presented	O
at	O
this	O
conference	O
from	O
a	O
guy	O
from	O
alabama	O

and	O
he	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
hired	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
study	O
by	O
two	O
departments	O
for	O
the	O
government	O

one	O
was	O
like	O
environmental	O
protection	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
one	O
was	O
oh	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
remember	O
what	O

but	O
the	O
basic	O
idea	O
it	O
was	O
presented	O
to	O
him	O
was	O
how	O
can	O
we	O
maximize	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
energy	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
get	O
back	O
from	O
recycling	O
and	O
minimize	O
the	O
volume	O
of	O
stuff	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
putting	O
into	O
our	O
landfill	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
solution	O
that	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
for	O
plastics	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
quite	O
amazing	O

he	O
says	O
well	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
plastics	O
is	O
to	O
burn	O
them	O

he	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
plastics	O
is	O
actually	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
problems	O
in	O
landfills	O
cause	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
low	O
weight	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
high	O
volume	O
so	O
it	O
takes	O
up	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
space	O

and	O
there	BE
's	IE
almost	IE
no	IE
energy	IP
there	C
's	C
very	C
little	C
energy	O
value	O
in	O
actually	O
doing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
recycling	O

but	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
energy	O
in	O
it	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
burn	O
it	O
and	O
use	O
it	O
produce	O
electricity	O

so	O
his	O
solution	O
was	O
to	O
burn	O
plastic	O
collect	O
it	O
and	O
burn	O
it	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
than	O
even	O
paper	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

there	O
is	O
more	O
energy	O
in	O
it	O
per	O
pound	O
or	O
whatever	O

well	O
that	BE
was	IP
he	C
did	C
n't	C
deal	O
with	O
that	O

he	O
just	O
said	O
burn	O
it	O

he	O
did	O
n't	O
talk	O
about	O
cleaning	O
it	O
up	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
very	O
practical	O

yeah	O

well	O
real	O
interesting	O

uh	O
not	O
too	O
much	O

uh	O
i	O
got	O
a	O
bit	O

actually	O

hello	O
chuck	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
new	O
revelation	O

right	O

so	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
is	O
the	O
e	O
p	O
a	O
recommending	O
now	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

that	BE
's	IE
a	IP
that	C
's	C
a	C
common	O
problem	O
though	O

that	BE_IP
it	C
seems	O
that	O
has	O
happened	O
in	O
dallas	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
new	O
york	O

and	O
i	O
try	O
to	O
recycle	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
newspapers	O
that	O
come	O
to	O
my	O
house	O

and	O
after	O
a	O
while	O
i	O
just	O
quit	O
taking	O
the	O
newspaper	O
because	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
recycle	O
it	O
anymore	O
which	O
is	O
n't	O
good	O
for	O
business	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
either	O
i	O
suppose	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

right	O

there	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
uh	O
a	O
reuse	O
for	O
it	O

i	O
mean	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
they	O
recycle	O

the	O
one	O
i	O
think	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
recycled	O
bottles	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
uh	O
the	O
industry	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
with	O
the	O
recycled	O
polymers	O
uh	O
everything	O
from	O
uh	O
waste	O
baskets	O
to	O
carpet	O
to	O
the	O
no	O
stick	O
i	O
mean	O
the	O
sticky	O
slide	O
rugs	O
under	O
the	O
carpet	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
are	O
even	O
putting	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
roadways	O
these	O
days	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
making	O
clothes	O
now	O
that	O
are	O
recycled	O

like	O
the	O
recycled	O
plastic	O
coke	O
bottles	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
milk	O
cartons	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
really	O

right	O

huh	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
carbon	O

so	O
that	O
makes	O
sense	O

like	O
a	O
carbon	O
fuel	O
of	O
some	O
sort	O

but	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
about	O
emissions	O

oh	O

okay	O

no	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
interesting	O

i	O
bet	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
day	O
at	O
the	O
yeah	O
conference	O
then	O

did	O
it	O
change	O
anything	O
for	O
you	O

so	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
my	O
feeling	O
is	O
that	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
really	O
being	O
used	O
today	O

it	BE_IP
it	C_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
it	C_IP
it	C
really	O
is	O
n't	O
doing	O
any	O
real	O
good	O
purpose	O
for	O
anything	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
cost	O
effective	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O
the	O
people	O
end	O
up	O
waiting	O
on	O
appeal	O

right	O

because	O
y-	BE_IP
you	C_IP
you	C
've	C
got	O
all	BE_IP
all	C
the	O
prison	O
expenses	O
plus	O
all	O
the	O
legal	O
expenses	O

uh	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
certainly	O
does	O
n't	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
deterrent	O
uh	O
for	O
one	O
thing	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
used	O
so	O
infrequently	O
and	O
for	O
another	O
thing	O
because	O
i	O
honestly	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
committing	O
the	O
c-	BE_IP
crimes	C
that	O
would	O
be	O
eligible	O
you	O
know	O
really	O
care	O

right	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
the	O
aids	O
phenomenon	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
'm	O
invulnerable	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
care	O
about	O
this	O

you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
'm	C
never	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
caught	O

yeah	O

one	BE_IP
one	C
way	O
or	O
another	O

yeah	O

but	BE_IP
but	C
the	O
other	O
side	O
to	O
that	O
is	O
if	O
you	O
put	O
him	O
in	O
prison	O
for	O
life	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
chance	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
do	O
things	O
in	O
prison	O
or	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
and	C
somehow	O
redeem	O
himself	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
question	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
other	O
qu-	O
problem	O
with	O
capital	O
punishment	O
you	O
run	O
into	O
is	O
what	O
are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
about	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
later	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
found	O
innocent	O
you	O
know	O

there	O
are	O
cases	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
twenty	O
thirty	O
years	O
after	O
the	O
fact	O
of	O
getting	O
evidence	O
especially	O
as	O
new	O
technology	O
comes	O
along	O
that	O
might	O
prove	O
their	O
innocence	O
then	O
oops	O

i	O
'm	O
sorry	O

guess	O
we	O
killed	O
the	O
wrong	O
guy	O

right	O

you	BE_IP
you	C
can	O
apologize	O
nicely	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
price	O
you	O
know	O

it	BE_IP
i	C_IE
've	C_IE
heard	C_IE
quotes	C_IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
's	C
better	C
that	O
a	O
thousand	O
people	O
go	O
free	O
than	O
one	O
person	O
be	O
unjustly	O
imprisoned	O
i	O
think	O
i-	BE_IP
is	C
really	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
philosophy	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
our	O
legal	O
system	O
works	O

yeah	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
the	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
's	O
being	O
used	O
now	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
you	O
listen	O
to	O
bush	O
is	O
you	O
know	O

well	O
where	O
are	O
we	O
going	O
to	O
impose	O
d-	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
for	O
drug	O
dealers	O
is	O
the	O
new	BE_IP
big	C
thing	O
like	O
in	O

tsongas	O
is	O
also	O
saying	O
you	O
know	O
capital	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
capital	O
crime	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
major	O
drug	O
dealer	O

and	O
again	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
thing	O
these	O
people	O
care	O

they	O
risk	O
their	O
lives	O
every	O
day	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
you	O
know	O
uh	O
especially	O
now	O
i	O
live	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
massachusetts	O
you	O
know	O

w-	BE_IP
w-	C_IP
we	C
're	C
going	O
to	O
get	O
capital	O
punishment	O
here	O
probably	O
after	O
the	O
second	O
coming	O
or	O
something	O

so	O
you	O
know	O

but	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
our	BE_IP
our	C
crime	O
rates	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
you	O
compare	O
them	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
like	O
texas	O
or	O
someplace	O
that	BE
does	IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
it	C_IP
it	C_IP
it	C
's	C
impossible	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
case	O
that	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
affecting	O
it	O
in	O
any	O
way	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
mainly	O
people	O
like	O
they	O
get	O
the	O
vengeance	O
of	O
it	O

because	O
you	O
know	O

oh	O
yeah	O

it	O
's	O
mainl-	O
lot	O
of	O
blacks	O

also	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
young	O
people	O

you	O
know	O
a	BE_IP
a	C_IP
a	C
sixty-two	O
year	O
old	O

is	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O

on	O

row	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
when	O
you	O
listen	O
to	O
like	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C_IE
the	C_IP
the	C
victims'	O
families	O
and	O
things	O
they	O
're	O
always	O
talking	O
about	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O
feeling	O

or	O
feeling	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
they	O
've	O
gotten	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

i	O

my	O
thought	O
has	O
been	O
once	O
the	O
guy	O
has	O
been	O
imprisoned	O
if	O
he	O
goes	O
to	O
jail	O
forever	O
or	O
whatever	O
if	O
he	O

it	O
should	O
n't	O
make	O
any	O
difference	O
to	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C
victim	O
's	O
family	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
should	O
really	O
i	O
mean	O

obviously	O
if	O
someone	O
of	O
mine	O
who	O
has	O
close	O
died	O
i	O
'd	O
probably	O
feel	O
differently	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
th-	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
what	C
the	C
important	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
be	O
caught	O
and	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
danger	O
to	O
society	O

right	O

i	O
mean	O
the	O

right	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
other	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
was	O
reading	O
through	O
a	O
book	O
on	O
uh	O
geneo	O
human	O
geneo	O

and	O
there	O
more	O

so	O
if	O
someday	O
we	O
can	O
go	O
to	O
jeff	O

and	O
say	O
well	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
've	C
got	O
an	O
endorphin	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O

this	O
regularly	O
you	O
'll	O
be	O
a	O
sane	O
and	O
productive	O
member	O
of	O
society	O
you	O
know	O

you	O
really	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
someone	O
responsible	O
for	O
their	O
actions	O

society	O
made	O
me	O
do	O
it	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
've	O
seen	O
some	O
statistics	O
that	O
say	O
that	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
expensive	O
to	O
kill	O
somebody	O
than	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
prison	O
for	O
life	O

right	O

well	O
that	O
's	O

committing	O
them	O
mostly	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
either	O
crimes	O
of	O
passion	O
or	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O

or	O
they	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
caught	O

or	O

yeah	O

b-	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
also	O
have	O
to	O
think	O
whether	O
it	O
's	O
worthwhile	O
on	O
the	O
individual	O
basis	O
for	O
example	O
someone	O
like	O
uh	O
jeffrey	O
dahlmer	O

do	O
you	O
want	O

by	O
putting	O
him	O
in	O
prison	O
for	O
life	O
there	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
possibility	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
get	O
out	O
again	O

whereas	O
if	O
you	O
kill	O
him	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
that	O
possibility	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
he	O
could	O
ever	O
redeem	O
himself	O

but	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
yes	O

yeah	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C

yeah	O

once	O
you	O
've	O
made	O
a	O
decision	O
that	O
way	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
difficult	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
on	O
it	O

oh	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
a-	O

the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

the	O
uh	O

right	O

yeah	O

and	O
there	BE_IP
there	C
they	O
seem	O
that	O
the	O

uh	O

the	O

that	O
yeah	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

is	O
almost	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
also	O

i	O

you	O

the	C

we	O

if	O

that	O

and	O
you	O

also	O
by	O

you	O

there	O

oh	O
i	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
like	O

or	O

huh	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O

what	O
type	O
of	BE
field	IP
of	C
work	C
are	O
you	O
in	O

oh	O
in	O
the	O
oil	O

okay	O

and	O
you	O

yeah	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
'm	O
all	O
for	O
it	O
because	O
the	BE_IP
well	C
the	C
type	O
of	O
environment	O
i	O
work	O
in	O
you	O
know	O
they	O

well	O
they	O
have	O
safety	O

with	O

but	O
still	O
it	O

yeah	O

now	O
do	O
they	O

them	O
or	O
do	O
they	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
wow	O

that	O

all	O
right	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
the	O

thing	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O

what	O
the	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
they	O
do	O
have	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
give	O
you	O
a	O
second	O

but	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	BE_IP
if	C_IE
it	C_IE
's	C_IP
if	C
you	C
get	O

or	O
if	O
you	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
works	O
very	O
good	O
with	O
that	O
random	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
limits	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

you	O
could	O
time	O
it	O
just	O
right	O

i	O
know	O
one	O
employee	O

i	O
know	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
working	O
with	O
he	O
had	O

on	O
his	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
our	O

covers	O
that	O
or	O
not	O

that	O
'd	O
be	O
just	O
as	O

huh	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

uh-huh	O

do	O
they	O

or	O

it	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

pretty	O

we	O
have	O

it	O
's	O
mostly	O
for	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
field	O
people	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
drive	O
trucks	O
and	O
heavy	O
machinery	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O

but	O
uh	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
have	O
done	O
some	O

around	O
our	O

mostly	O
after	O

uh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	O

uh	O
straight	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IP

when	O
you	O

uh	O
uh	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
you	O

you	O

if	O
it	O
's	O

as	O

uh	O
you	O

you	O

i	O

well	O
see	O
this	O
is	O
it	O

this	O
is	O
where	O
i	O
start	O
having	O
my	O
problems	O
with	O
my	O
company	O

i	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
private	O
company	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O
policy	O
is	O
something	O
like	O
see	O
if	O
i	O
can	O
re-	BE_IP
state	C
this	O
correctly	O
now	O
if	O
you	O
turn	O
yourself	O
in	O
as	O
having	O
a	O

then	O
you	O
're	O

if	BE
they	IE

you	IP
if	C
you	C

a	C

one	O
of	O
these	O

twenty-twos	O

yeah	O

really	O

it	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
those	O

then	O
if	BE
you	IP
if	C

it	O
you	O
just	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

our	O
company	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
tougher	O
on	O
the	O

i	O

they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
the	O

you	O

go	O
out	O

i	O
think	O
a	O
little	O

more	O
to	BE_IP
uh	C
to	C

you	O

you	C

uh	O
when	BE

when	C
you	C

the	O

well	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
hard	O
for	O
me	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
evaluate	O
it	O
because	O
everybody	O

and	O
you	O

it	O

so	O
uh	O
i	O
'd	O
rather	O
have	O
that	O
than	O
you	O
know	O
say	O
well	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

yeah	O

well	O
especially	O
around	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
equipment	O
machinery	O
and	O
stuff	O

you	O
know	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
gone	O
out	O
and	O
had	BE
a	IP
had	C
a	C
beer	O
at	O
lunch	O
time	O
but	O
not	O
to	O
excess	O
in	O
any	O
case	O

uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
remember	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
truth	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
they	O
do	O

um	O
well	O
they	O
must	O

i	O
mean	O
gee	O
whiz	O

that	O
just	O
shows	O
you	O
how	O
much	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
paying	O
attention	O

because	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
'll	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
work	O
tomorrow	O
and	O
ask	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
can	O
take	O
some	O
of	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
testing	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
too	O
far	O

uh	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
company	O
in	O
houston	O
that	O

they	O
did	O
uh	O
an	O
unannounced	O
drug	O
sweep	O
of	BE
the	IP
of	C
their	C
company	O

oh	O
it	BE
was	IP
it	C_IE
was	C_IP
it	C
was	C
an	O
unannounced	O
sweep	O
of	BE_IP
of	C

it	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
drugs	O

okay	O
karen	O

you-	O
you	O
're	O
first	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
differences	O
i	O
see	O
is	O
uh	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
university	O
uh	O
there	O
is	O
room	O
for	O
advancement	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
so	O
our	BE
in	IP
uh	C
quite	C
a	C
highly	O
unionized	O
environment	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
in	O
the	O
administrative	O
association	O

so	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
progressive	O
path	O

but	O
not	O
being	O
in	O
the	BE_IP
say	C
the	C
commercial	O
sector	O
the	O
motivation	O
is	O
n't	O
there	O
for	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
uh	O
like	O
really	O

yeah	O

somewhat	O
that	O

but	O
then	O
also	O
there	O
just	O
is	O
n't	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
have	O
uh	O
a	O
broader	O
scope	O
for	O
rewarding	O
people	O
for	O
their	O
performances	O

uh	O
so	O
that	O
's	O
in	O
our	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
are	O
dealing	O
with	O
an	O
institution	O

uh	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
difficult	O
to	O
recognize	O
an	O
individual	O
's	O
performance	O

and	O
i	O
suppose	O
that	O
's	O
maybe	O
a	O
disadvantage	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
larger	O
institution	O
perhaps	O
somewhat	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
business	O
uh	O

but	O
i	O
agree	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
uh	O
medical	O
benefits	O
and	O
those	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O
are	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
big	O
pluses	O
of	O
working	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
organization	O
and	O
also	O
the	O
uh	O
security	O
aspect	O
for	O
long	O
term	O
employment	O
uh	O

job	O
security	O

yes	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

we	O
are	O
seeing	O
that	O
here	O
as	O
well	O

like	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
oil	O
companies	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
massive	O
lay	O
offs	O

uh	O
so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
there	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
probably	O
a	O
major	O
distinction	O
between	O
institutions	O
and	O
the	O
corporate	O
world	O
in	O
uh	O
institutions	O
are	O
slower	O
to	O
react	O
both	O
on	O
the	O
growth	O
side	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
on	O
the	O
reduction	O
side	O
where	O
the	O
businesses	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
cut	O
back	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
we	O
do	O

but	O

yeah	O

and	O
institutionally	O
like	O
here	O
at	O
the	O
university	O
oh	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
cut	O
back	O
well	O
gee	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
where	O
it	O
necessarily	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
needed	O

it	BE
's	IP
where	C
it	C
's	C
most	O
expedient	O
which	BE_IP
well	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
for	O
us	O
it	BE
's	IP
where	C
it	C
makes	O
the	O
least	O
noise	O
which	O
means	O
it	O
's	O
often	O
the	O
lowest	O
support	O
type	O
roles	O

so	O
we	O

it	O
's	O
very	O
easy	O

yeah	O

right	O

because	O
it	O
's	O
support	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
providing	O
the	O
speed	O
for	O
it	O

well	O
the	O
uh	O

that	O
's	O
maybe	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
importance	O
i	O
guess	O

yeah	O

because	O
my	O
perspective	O
is	O
from	O
an	O
institution	O

uh	O
the	BE_IP
there	C
is	O
not	O
much	O
incentive	O
for	O
innovativeness	O
because	O
the	O
limitation	O
for	O
reward	O
is	O
very	O
severe	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
the	O
corporate	O
world	O
i	O
think	O
there	O
is	O
considerable	O
motivation	O
for	O
i	O
guess	O
in-	BE_IP
innovation	C

although	O
he	BE_IP
you	O
know	O
the	O
more	O
complex	O
your	O
structure	O
the	O
uh	O
less	O
difficult	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
carry	O
some	O
things	O
through	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
there	BE
is	IP
uh	C
it	C
's	C
a	O
long	O
term	O
type	O
of	O
process	O
where	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
organization	O
it	BE
's	IP
uh	O
things	O
can	O
happen	O
much	O
more	O
quickly	O

and	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
the	O
reward	O
of	O
the	O
efforts	O

right	O

yeah	O

you	O
end	O
up	O
being	O
your	O
own	O
person	O

and	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
job	O
fine	O
and	O
if	O
somebody	O
else	O
is	O
messing	O
it	O
up	O
well	O
then	O
that	O
's	O
their	O
problem	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
really	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
becomes	O
the	O
organization	O
instead	O
of	O
person	O
being	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
individual	O
themselves	O

okay	O

i	O
was	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
say	O
i	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
thing	O
for	O
me	O
is	O
room	O
for	O
advancement	O
you	O
know	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
in	BE_IP
like	C
in	C
a	O
dead	O
end	O
job	O

and	BE_IP
plus	C
for	O
me	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
i	O
mean	O
like	O
medical	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O
benefits	O
and	O
dental	O

they	O
're	O
also	O
important	O

um	O

um	O

are	O
they	O
like	O
pretty	O
much	O
train	O
for	O
a	O
specific	O
job	O

and	O
that	BE_IP
what	O
i	O
hired	O
for	O
and	O
then	O
i	O
just	O
very	O
little	O
variation	O
from	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
interesting	O
though	O

because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
's	O
necessarily	O
the	O
case	O
anymore	O

i	O
use	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
after	O
you	O
work	O

you	O
mean	O
security	O
job	O
security	O

uh	O
that	O
use	O
to	O
be	O
i	O
think	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
anymore	O

in	O
fact	O
they	BE_IP
we	C
just	O
had	O
a	O
lay	O
off	O
in	O
what	O
november	O
i	O
guess	O

but	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
necessarily	O

i	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
some	O
people	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

no	O
doubt	O

yeah	O

expedient	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
exactly	O
it	O

yeah	O

where	O
the	O
most	O
dollar	O
where	BE_IP
where	C
you	O
know	O
it	O
cuts	O
back	O
the	O
most	O

oh	O

oh	O

see	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
too	O

you	O
get	O
too	O
many	O
management	O
people	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
easy	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
say	O
oh	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
when	O
they	O
really	O
are	O
n't	O
aware	O
of	O
what	O
all	O
it	O
took	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
work	O
done	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
wonder	O
why	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O

well	O
those	O
people	O
are	O
n't	O
there	O
anymore	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

but	O

so	O
what	O
else	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
is	O
important	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
think	O
probably	O
in	O
a	O
small	O

yeah	O

i	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
say	O
more	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
personal	O
for	O
one	O
thing	O

you	O
probably	O
have	O
a	O
better	O
team	O
uh	O
cooperation	O
or	O
team	O
playing	O
atmosphere	O

probably	O
where	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
bigger	O
corporation	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
just	O
a	O
number	O
you	O
know	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

whereas	O
yeah	O
in	O
a	O
smaller	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
willing	O
to	O
either	O
help	O
that	O
person	O
or	O
help	O
it	O
get	O
accomplished	O
you	O
know	O

uh-huh	O

okay	O

so	O
uh	O
with	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
uh	O
i	O
actually	O
found	O
the	O
whole	O
question	O
about	O
whether	O
you	O
need	O
a	BE_IP
a	C_IE
unan-	C_IP
a	C
unanimous	C
verdict	C
in	O
a	O
criminal	O
case	O
to	O
be	O
somewhat	O
interesting	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
even	O
true	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
always	O
unanimous	O
because	O
i	O
thought	O
there	O
were	O
cases	O
where	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
felonies	O
and	O
misdemeanors	O
but	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
okay	O
for	O
a	O
state	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
like	O
eleven	O
out	O
of	O
twelve	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
'd	O
be	O
curious	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
uh	O
requirement	O
for	O
a	BE_IP
an	C
acquittal	O
is	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
wrong	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
eleven	O
out	O
of	O
twelve	O
can	O
convict	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
something	O
corresponding	O
saying	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
voted	O
not	O
guilty	O
then	O
instead	O
of	O
it	O
being	O
a	O
hung	O
jury	O
that	O
was	O
an	O
acquittal	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
whether	O
you	O
need	O
an	O
a	O
unanimous	O
uh	O
vote	O
of	O
not	O
guilty	O
to	O
acquit	O

yeah	O

i	O
'd	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
had	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
opportunity	O
to	O
serve	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O
although	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
out	O
here	O
and	O
registered	O
for	O
i	O
guess	O
about	O
five	O
years	O

but	O

oh	O

well	O
the	O
people	O
i	O
know	O
who	O
have	O
served	O
have	O
said	O
that	O
usually	O
what	O
ends	O
up	O
happening	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
after	O
initially	O
finding	O
out	O
where	O
people	O
stand	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
deliberation	O
usually	O
results	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
a	BE_IP
you	O
know	O
something	O
like	O
a	O
nine	O
three	O
or	BE_IP
or	C
more	O
severe	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
majority	O
trying	O
to	O
convince	O
the	O
minority	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
right	O

and	O
in	O
fact	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
any	O
more	O
uh	O
liable	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
reasonable	O
doubt	O
than	BE_IP
than	C
anything	O
else	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
'd	O
read	O
one	O
book	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
calls	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
of	O
all	O
things	O
that	O
uh	O
went	O
through	O
and	O
interviewed	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
jurors	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
big	O
cases	O
and	O
in	O
many	O
cases	O
looking	O
at	O
what	O
had	O
at	O
the	O
evidence	O
afterwards	O
as	O
to	O
whether	O
the	O
decision	O
was	O
right	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
jurors	O
uh	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
deliberations	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
did	O
say	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
left	O
opposing	O
the	O
verdict	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
everyone	O
was	O
getting	O
on	O
them	O
so	BE_IP
so	C
heavily	O
that	O
eventually	O
they	O
just	O
gave	O
in	O
knowing	O
that	O
nothing	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
could	O
stop	O
it	O
from	O
either	O
being	O
the	O
verdict	O
everyone	O
else	O
was	O
trying	O
for	O
or	O
a	O
hung	O
jury	O
because	O
the	O
one	O
vote	O
does	O
n't	O
mean	O
anything	O
except	O
the	O
ability	O
to	O
not	O
have	O
a	O
verdict	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

once	O

hi	O

yeah	O

actually	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
agree	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
interesting	O
thing	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
believe	C_IE
that	C_IE
's	C_IE
a	C_IP
for	C_IP
for	C
civil	O
suits	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
unanimous	O
right	O

but	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
criminal	O
suits	O
it	O
's	O
unanimous	O
by	O
federal	O
law	O

yeah	O

i	O
actually	O
thought	O
i	O
'd	O
read	O
that	O
too	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
i	O
phrased	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

i	O
wonder	O

the	BE
difference	IP
yeah	C
the	C
difference	C
could	O
be	O
that	O
for	O
uh	O
state	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
such	O
a	O

felonies	O
that	O
federal	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
under	O
federal	O
jurisdiction	O
require	O
the	O

and	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
under	O
state	O
jurisdiction	O
even	O
criminal	O
do	O
n't	O
require	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
laws	O

do	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
unreasonable	O
uh	O
requirement	O
that	O
they	O
be	O
unanimous	O

yeah	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
would	O
be	O
an	O
interesting	O
change	O

it	O
was	O
also	O
allow	O
the	O
uh	O
idea	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
had	O
one	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
uh	O
very	O
disagreeable	O
that	O
i	O
mean	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
fundamentally	O
changes	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
processing	O
occurs	O
because	O
uh	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	BE
's	IE
w-	IP
the	C_IP
the	C
principle	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
unanimous	O
insures	O
the	O
beyond	O
a	O
reasonable	O
doubt	O
uh	O
criterion	O
that	O
it	O
uh	O
increases	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
likelihood	O
of	O
getting	O
the	O
proper	O
judgment	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
if	O
anything	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
close	O
to	O
unanimous	O
decision	O

yeah	O

actually	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
thought	O
that	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
interesting	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
out	O
here	O
twenty	O
some	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
called	O
uh	O
three	O
different	O
times	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
actually	O
even	O
made	O
it	O
into	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
jury	O
box	O
and	BE_IP
because	C
there	O
have	O
always	O
been	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
people	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
've	O
never	O
gotten	O
up	O
there	O
to	O
answer	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
questions	O

uh	O
i	O

yeah	O

i	O
also	O
think	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
really	O
good	O

i	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
one	O
thing	O
that	O
i	O
know	O
does	O
seem	O
to	O
happen	O
from	O
people	O
i	O
've	O
talked	O
to	O
on	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
situation	O
you	O
just	O
said	O
where	O
it	O
's	O
nine	O
to	O
three	O
or	O
some	O
such	O
number	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
an	O
effect	O
starts	O
being	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
starts	O
being	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
peer	O
pressure	O
going	O
on	O

and	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
uh	O
peer	O
pressure	O

and	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
long	O
trial	O
the	O
desire	O
of	O
people	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
there	O
and	O
not	O
be	O
stuck	O
in	O
there	O
for	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
time	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
changing	O
their	O
minds	O
for	O
the	O
wrong	O
reasons	O

uh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
understand	O

you	BE_IP
you	C
would	O
hope	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
were	O
in	O
that	O
situation	O
that	O
you	O
'd	O
have	O
the	O
moral	O

uh	O
to	O
hold	O
out	O
if	O
you	O
believed	O
that	O
that	O
was	O
really	O
the	O
proper	O
response	O

i	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
movie	O
uh	O
twelve	O
angry	O
men	O

you	O
ever	O
seen	O
that	O
movie	O

uh	O
yeah	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C_IE

it	C

exactly	O
that	O

where	O
uh	O

um	O

well	O
i	O
read	O
uh	O

i	O

a	O
bunch	O
of	O
different	O
things	O

i	O
get	O
a	O

every	O

and	O
i	O
try	O

a	O

that	O

and	O
i	O
look	O
through	O
uh	O

i	O
get	O
a	O
newsweek	O
every	O

which	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
pretty	O
much	O
read	O
that	O
cover	O
to	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
as	O
far	O
as	O
you	O
know	O

that	O
satisfies	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
short	O

news	O
i	O
get	O

uh	O
do	O
n't	O
watch	O

much	O
especially	O
the	O

or	O
anything	O

happened	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
all	O
i	O
ever	O

of	O
it	O

uh	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
news	O
probably	O
comes	O
from	O
newsweek	O

and	O
for	O
the	O
longer	O
term	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
read	O
uh	O
like	O
scientific	O
american	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
uh	O
readers'	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
those	O

that	O

they	O

the	O

what	O
you	O

yeah	O

it	BE

it	C

well	O
actually	O
it	O

it	O
's	O
just	O

uh	O
it	BE

information	O
you	O

down	O
on	O
the	O

you	O

yes	O

or	O
they	O
're	O
making	O
making	O
time	O
because	O
they	BE_IP
to	O
fill	O
in	O
an	O
hour	O
's	O
worth	O
of	O
news	O

uh	O
i	O
get	O
kind	O
of	O
bored	O
watching	O
t	O
v	O
actually	O
when	O
i	O
watch	O
the	O
news	O
on	O
t	O
v	O
because	O
it	O
goes	O
so	O
slow	O

and	O
then	O
there	O
's	O
nothing	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
really	O
is	O
like	O
oh	O
so	O
exciting	O

yeah	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
about	O
what	O
it	O
ends	O
up	O
being	O

listen	O
to	O
the	O
news	O
to	O
hear	O
the	O
traffic	O
report	O
or	O
something	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
about	O
the	O
same	O

i	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
they	C_IP
they	C
certainly	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
similar	O
uh	O
charter	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O

and	O
uh	O
uh	O
what	BE_IP
what	C_IE
kind	C_IE
of	C_IP
uh	C
what	C
kind	C
of	C
news	O
normally	O
interests	O
you	O

i	O
mean	O
what	BE
do	IE
you	IP
what	C_IP
what	C
do	C
you	C
find	O
interesting	O
versus	BE_IP
what	C
do	O
you	O
find	O
boring	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
will	O

uh	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
keep	O
claiming	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
big	O
influence	O

but	O
we	O
've	O
yet	O
to	O
see	O
it	O

and	O
th-	O

it	O
's	O
real	O
short	O
term	O
yet	O
though	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
only	O
been	O
three	O
months	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
since	O
that	O
happened	O

so	O

but	O
they	O
like	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
important	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
too	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
possibility	O

uh	O
it	BE_IP
we	C
might	O
also	O
be	O
helped	O
though	O
because	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
will	O
be	O
easier	O
to	O
do	O
business	O
over	O
there	O
too	O

for	O
the	O
companies	O
that	O
already	O
have	O
a	O
presence	O
over	O
there	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
know	O
of	O
at	O
least	O
one	O
company	O
that	O
specifically	O
went	O
over	O
there	O
and	O
established	O
a	O
presence	O
before	O
nineteen	O
ninety-two	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
it	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
time	O

yep	O

because	O
once	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
there	O
then	O
you	O
can	O
easily	O
expand	O

but	O
getting	O
in	O
after	O
nineteen	O
ninety-two	O
is	O
more	O
difficult	O

yes	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
already	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
evidence	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
being	O
very	O
protectionist	O

even	O
amongst	O
themselves	O
they	O
're	O
being	O
somewhat	O
protectionist	O
you	O
know	O

like	O
england	O
does	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
one	O
thing	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
sweden	O
does	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
other	O
thing	O

and	O
they	BE
're	IP
they	C
've	C
all	O
got	O
their	O
own	O
reasons	O
which	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
resolved	O
yet	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
i	O
mean	O
is	O

i	O
'm	O
sure	O
within	O
those	O
people	O
's	O
minds	O
it	O
's	O
quite	O
justified	O

uh-huh	O

before	O
they	O
open	O
up	O
their	O
borders	O
to	O
everyone	O

uh	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
uh	O

do	O
you	O
watch	O
anything	O
like	O
with	O
sports	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O

against	O
your	O
will	O

yeah	O

at	O
least	O
you	O
guys	O
have	O
a	O
remote	O
control	O

it	O
's	O
sometimes	O
better	O
to	O
not	O
have	O
one	O
of	O
those	O

course	O
you	O
can	O
always	O
mislocate	O
it	O
or	O
misplace	O
it	O
i	O
mean	O
not	O
mislocate	O
it	O
but	O
misplace	O
it	O

and	O

uh	O
actually	O
no	O

because	BE_IP
because	C
i	O
'm	O
in	O
school	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
miss	O
out	O
on	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
current	O
events	O

i	O
just	O
catch	O
the	O
major	O
ones	O
off	O
the	O
news	O
or	O
if	O
someone	O
starts	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
it	O

uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
watch	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
on-	O

basically	O
that	O
's	O
my	O
only	O
major	O
source	O
of	O
information	O

what	BE
about	IP
what	C
about	C
you	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
in	O
depth	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O

where	O
they	O
're	O
just	O
trying	O
to	O
fill	O
in	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O

i	BE
do	IP
i	C
do	C
too	O

yeah	O

you	O
may	O
find	O
one	O
little	O
uh	O
news	O
item	O
interesting	O

so	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
hear	O
about	O
it	O

yeah	O

actually	O
y-	BE_IP
you	C
mention	O
newsweek	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C
do	O
like	O
uh	O
u	O
s	O
news	O
and	O
world	O
report	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
to	O
read	O
it	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
i	O
like	O

but	O
that	BE
's	IP
i	C
think	C
that	C
's	C
a	O
good	O
magazine	O

well	O
right	O
now	O
trying	O
to	O
keep	O
abreast	O
of	O
uh	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
europe	O
you	O
know	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
u	O
s	O
s	O
r	O
's	O
satellites	O
breaking	O
off	O
trying	O
to	O
become	O
independent	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
european	O
community	O
coming	O
together	O

that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
affect	O
our	O
uh	O
economy	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

oh	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
pretty	O
sure	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
uh	O
once	BE_IP
once	C
europe	O
becomes	O
unified	O
and	O
uh	O
their	O
economy	O
becomes	O
one	O
big	O
economy	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
uh	O
kind	O
of	O
hurting	O

yeah	O

definitely	O

oh	O
yeah	O

so	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
toe	O
hold	O

i	O
good	O
toe	O
hold	O

yeah	O

because	O
when	O
they	O
first	O
start	O
off	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
highly	O
protectionist	O

so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
can	O
understand	O
their	O
viewpoint	O

they	BE
're	IE
just	IP
they	C
're	C
starting	O
off	O

their	O
economy	O
's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
weak	O

so	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
established	O
before	O
they	O
com-	O

yeah	O

totally	O

actually	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
into	O
sports	O

my	O
roommates	O
are	O

so	O
unfortunately	O
i	O
forced	O
to	O
watch	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
sports	O

yeah	O

we	O
have	O
to	O
fight	O
over	O
the	O
remote	O
control	O

okay	O

um	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
talk	O
describe	O
uh	O
job	O
benefits	O

and	O
so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
next	O
to	O
salary	O
do	O
you	O
rank	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
job	O
benefits	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
um	O
does	O
your	O
company	O
have	O
good	O
benefits	O
in	BE
that	IP
in	C
that	C
regard	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
see	O

uh	O
well	O
i	O
'm	O

my	O
medical	O
coverage	O
is	O
with	O
an	O
h	O
m	O
o	O

um	O
so	O
that	BE
's	IE
in	IP
my	C_IE
opinion	C_IE
that	C_IE
's	C_IE
get-	C_IP
that	C
's	C
bordering	C
on	O
a	O
health	O
clinic	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	O
maintain	O
costs	O
and	O
still	O
provide	O
a	O
good	O
amount	O
of	O

uh	O
georgia	O
tech	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
another	O
one	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
i	O
rank	O
up	O
there	O
high	O
is	O
the	O
uh	O
kind	O
of	O
job	O
flexibility	O
and	O
time	O
off	O
um	O
i	O
enjoy	O
as	O
a	O
benefit	O

right	O

yeah	O

getting	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
breaks	O
between	O
quarters	O
and	O
that	O
and	O
having	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
vacation	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

well	O
um	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
actually	O
on	O
the	O
teaching	O
faculty	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
large	O
research	O
organization	O
associated	O
with	O
the	O
university	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
who	O
i	O
work	O
with	O

um	O
and	O
we	O
're	O
given	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
good	O
bit	O
of	O
flexibility	O
in	O
what	O
we	O
do	O

we	O
can	O
kind	O
of	O
pursue	O
our	O
own	O
interests	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	O
research	O
areas	O
that	O
we	O
study	O

right	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

uh-huh	O

are	BE
there	IP
are	C
there	C
any	O
things	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
you	O
'd	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
changed	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
benefits	O

uh	O
i	O
would	O
say	O
the	O
medical	O
uh	O
group	O
insurance	O
area	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
uh	O
covering	O
medical	O
costs	O
for	O
yourself	O
or	O
family	O
members	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O

i	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
public	O
school	O
system	O
district	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
so	C
it	O
's	O
different	O
than	O
a	O
company	O
where	O
most	O
companies	O
fund	O
almost	O
the	O
entire	O
thing	O

where	O
the	O
school	O
district	O
does	O
um	O
the	O
employee	O
must	O
pick	O
up	O
a	O
greater	O
figure	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
uh	O
costs	O

but	O
overall	O
um	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
pleased	O
with	O
it	O
over	O
the	O
years	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
biggest	O
frustration	O
is	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
insurance	O
going	O
up	O
every	O
year	O
our	O
district	O
has	O
had	O
to	O
alter	BE_IP
uh	C
you	C
know	C
change	C
companies	O

or	O
now	O
we	O
're	O
on	O
a	O
managed	O
care	O
thing	O
which	O
has	O
stressed	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
out	O
although	O
it	O
has	O
not	O
disturbed	O
me	O
any	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

yeah	O

our	O
district	O
did	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
ninety-one	O
and	O
the	O
ninety	O
school	O
year	O
or	O
calendar	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
h	O
m	O
o	O

and	O
um	O
i	O
was	O
because	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
same	O
doctor	O
you	O
know	O
agreed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
it	O
for	O
uh	O

they	O
usually	O
sign	O
a	O
contract	O
or	O
something	O

and	O
um	O
uh	O
i	O
did	O
have	O
surgery	O
last	O
summer	O

and	O
i	O
paid	O
ten	O
dollars	O
when	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
that	O
first	O
day	O

and	O
i	O
've	O
never	O
seen	O
another	O
bill	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
have	O
to	O
say	O
it	O
really	O
works	O

but	O
again	O
i	O
was	O
fortunate	O
because	O
my	O
doctor	O
agreed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
it	O

uh	O
if	O
you	O
've	O
been	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
doctor	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
ten	O
years	O
or	O
something	O
and	O
he	O
elects	O
not	O
to	O
join	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
stressful	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
those	O
people	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
you	O
know	O
have	O
a	O
family	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
um	O
everybody	O
's	O
gone	O
to	O
different	O
doctors	O
uh	O
it	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
give	O
up	O
somebody	O
who	O
you	O
feel	O
knows	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
body	O
and	O
your	O
just	O
has	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
the	O
medical	O
history	O

and	O
you	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
with	O
it	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
sure	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
stressful	O

and	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
i	O
have	O
just	O
elected	O
that	O
if	O
that	O
happens	O
i	O
will	O
go	O
and	O
just	O
pay	O

you	O
can	O
continue	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
your	O
own	O
doctor	O

but	O
your	O
benefits	O
are	O
not	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
good	O

so	O
uh	O

oh	O
all	O
right	O

i	O
do	O
too	O

are	O
you	O
talking	O
about	O
like	O
spring	O
break	O

and	O

right	O

right	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
really	O
um	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
teachers	O

now	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
a	O
teacher	O

i	O
am	O
a	O
secretarial	O
executive	O
assistant	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
the	O
teachers	O
could	O
stand	O
the	O
stress	O
all	BE_IP
all	C
year	O
long	O
frankly	O

it	O
is	O
just	O
texas	O
has	O
really	O
um	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
want	O
everybody	O
educated	O
no	O
matter	O
what	O
it	O
costs	O

uh	O
and	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
would	O
be	O
just	O

we	O
all	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O

like	O
in	O
two	O
weeks	O
we	O
have	O
spring	O
break	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
who	O
looks	O
forward	O
to	O
it	O
more	O
the	O
students	O
or	O
the	O
teachers	O
and	O
the	O
staff	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
there	O

okay	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

yeah	O

i	O
would	O
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
type	O
of	O
employment	O
you	BE
're	IP
you	C_IE
're	C_IE
one	C_IE
day	C_IP
you	C
might	C
be	C
really	C
tuned	O
in	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
oh	O
a	O
little	O
luke	O
warm	O
or	O
something	O

and	O
um	O
it	O
's	O
good	O
that	O
they	O
allow	O
you	O
that	O

it	O
um	O

as	O
i	O
say	O
the	O
schools	O

now	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
day	O

but	O
we	O
do	O
get	O
many	O
days	O
off	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
all	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
i	O
work	O
there	O
is	O
that	O
my	O
children	O
now	O
have	O
graduated	O
and	O
graduated	O
from	O
college	O

but	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
i	O
worked	O
there	O
because	O
my	O
hours	O
and	O
days	O
were	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
theirs	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
've	O
just	O
continued	O
to	O
uh	O
stay	O
there	O

okay	O

i	O
guess	O
it	O
took	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
the	O
recording	O
has	O
started	O
now	O

uh	O

i	O
served	O

i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
force	O
and	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
court	O
martial	O
uh	O
board	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
similar	O
to	O
a	O
jury	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
rules	O
apply	O

have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
one	O

uh-huh	O

was	O
it	O
civil	O
or	O
criminal	O

a	O
grand	O
jury	O
or	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
see	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
did	BE_IP
did	C
the	O
judge	O
uh	O
hand	O
down	O
sentences	O

or	O
did	O
you	O
folks	O
do	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

no	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
science	O
in	O
itself	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
see	O

because	O
you	O
'd	O
probably	O
be	O
uh	O
too	O
puritanical	O

and	O

uh-huh	O

so	O
uh	O
were	BE_IP
were	C
the	O
uh	O
sentences	O
that	O
the	O

out	O
what	O
you	O

or	O

if	O

you	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O

huh	O

um	O

wow	O

i	O
bet	O
that	O
made	O
him	O
happy	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

oh	O
how	O
many	O
members	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O

was	O
it	O
a	O
six	O
or	O
twelve	O
member	O
jury	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
curious	O
to	O
me	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
realize	O
until	O
the	O
uh	O
wayne	O
kennedy	O
smith	O
trial	O
uh	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
ago	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
six	O

i	O
thought	O
that	O
they	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
was	O
always	O
twelve	BE_IP
twelve	C
men	O
tried	O
and	O
true	O
so	O
to	O

but	O
uh	O
apparently	O
for	O
some	BE_IP
some	C
crimes	O
it	O
's	O
permissible	O
to	O
have	O
six	O
people	O
sit	O
in	O

on	O
a	O

getting	O
to	O
this	O

whether	O
you	O

a	O

should	O
be	O
unanimous	O
or	BE
not	IP
or	C
not	C
in	O
a	O
court	O
martial	O
case	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
require	O
the	O
jury	O
to	O
be	O

it	O
's	O
a	O
simple	O
majority	O
you	O
know	O
rules	O

probably	O
on	O
capital	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

we	BE

n't	IP
we	C_IP
we	C

the	O
two	O
that	O
i	O
were	O

with	O

and	O
uh	O
we	BE

uh	C

is	C

the	O
person	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
in	BE
our	IP
in	C
our	C
uh	O
gut	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O

were	O
both	O
guilty	O
just	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
friends	O
because	O
of	O
various	O
things	O

the	O
government	O
really	O
failed	O
to	O
prove	O
its	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
being	O

to	O
the	O
person	O
if	O
the	O

does	O
n't	O
prove	O

no	O

how	O
you	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
by	O
what	O
's	O

as	O
proof	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
acquit	O
him	O
in	O
both	O
cases	O

uh	O
yeah	O

it	O
was	O
yeah	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
critical	O
things	O
like	O
the	O
off-	O
special	O
investigations	O
at	O
one	O
time	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
cases	O
had	O
videotaped	O
this	O

but	O
something	O
happened	O
to	O
the	O
camera	O
and	O
the	O
tape	O
and	O

all	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
was	O
testify	O

yeah	O

so	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
served	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O

yeah	O

i	O
finally	O
served	O
on	O
one	O
last	O
year	O

i	O
've	O
um	O
been	O
voting	O
for	O
years	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
figure	O
out	O
why	O
i	O
had	O
n't	O
been	O
called	O
yet	O

and	O
i	O
finally	O
was	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
interesting	O
experience	O

i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
boring	O

uh	O
it	BE
was	IP
uh	C_IE
uh	C_IE
it	C_IE
was	C_IP
uh	C
well	C
let	C
's	C
see	C
it	C
was	C
municipal	O
court	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
uh	O

and	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
pool	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
criminal	O
and	O
civil	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
uh	O

well	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
spent	O
sitting	O
around	O
in	O
the	O
jury	O
room	O
and	O
getting	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
other	O
potential	O
jurors	O

and	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
always	O
exciting	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
called	O
to	BE_IP
to	C_IP
to	C
go	O
because	O
then	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
else	O
besides	O
uh	O
just	O
sit	O
in	O
the	O
jury	O
room	O

uh	O
yeah	O

the	O
judge	O
did	O

uh	O
i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C
had	O
a	O
hard	O
time	O
getting	O
seated	O
on	O
a	O
jury	O

i	O
kept	O
getting	O
uh	O

i	O
'd	O
be	O
questioned	O
uh	O
for	O
empaneling	O
the	O
jury	O

and	O
they	O
kept	O
uh	O
dismissing	O
me	O

course	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
reason	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
whether	O
the	O
prosecutor	O
or	O
the	O
defense	O
attorney	O
feels	O
like	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
best	O
uh	O
mix	O
for	O
their	O
case	O

so	O
they	O
ask	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
wild	O
questions	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
kept	O
getting	O
called	O
up	O
for	O
drunk	O
driving	O
questions	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
they	BE
did	IE
n't	IP
uh	C
they	C
did	C
n't	C
like	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
drink	O
any	O
more	O

so	O

yeah	O

that	O
was	O
probably	O
it	O

although	O
in	O
my	O
case	O
i	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
uh	O
sympathetic	O
with	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
got	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

well	O
i	O
was	O
never	BE
there	IP
never	C
there	C
for	O
any	O
sentencing	O

uh	O
i	O
finally	O
got	O
empaneled	O
on	O
one	O

uh	O
on	O
my	O
next	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
uh	O
jury	O

to	O
uh	O
decide	O
the	O
case	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
one	O
guy	O
on	O
the	O
jury	O
who	O
announced	O
to	O
everybody	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
deliberate	O
because	O
he	O
'd	O
already	O

that	O
the	O
guy	O
was	O
uh	O
not	O
guilty	O

and	O
he	O
would	O
never	O

for	O

so	O
uh	O
they	O
appointed	O
me	O
jury	O
jury	O

and	O
i	O
uh	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
going	O
in	O
without	O
deliberating	O
allowed	O
us	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O

so	O
i	O
told	O
the	O
judge	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
n't	O
were	O
unable	O
to	O
reach	O
a	O

because	O
we	O
could	O
n't	O
get	O
one	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
jury	O
to	O
deliberate	O

so	O
the	O

made	O
on	O

until	O
we	O

what	O
our	O

are	O
they	O

or	BE_IP
or	C
that	BE_IP
that	C
are	O

to	O

so	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
we	O
work	O
well	O
together	O

or	O
are	O
they	O

is	O
it	O
a	O

institution	O

is	BE
it	IP
is	C_IP
is	C
it	C
designed	O
for	O
punishment	O

um	O
the	O
death	O
penalty	O
surely	O
fits	O
in	BE_IP
well	C_IE
with	C_IP
uh	C
in	C
a	O
penal	O
situation	O
where	O
you	O
're	O
trying	O
to	O
punishment	O

uh	O
perhaps	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
that	O
we	O
do	O
it	O

but	BE_IP
but	C
it	BE_IP
in	C_IP
in	C
theory	C
it	C
fits	O
in	O

in	O
reforma-	O
system	O
in	O
a	O

i	O

if	BE
you	IP
if	C
you	C

you	O
obviously	O

um	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O

so	O
i	O
work	O
and	O
go	O

about	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
really	O
do	O

we	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

what	O
about	O
you	O

huh	O

yeah	O

uh	O
they	O
do	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
if	O
you	O

uh	O

then	O
i	O

some	O
of	O

that	O

and	O

um	O
they	O
might	O
you	O
know	O
pay	O
for	O
that	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
classes	O

but	O
i	O
know	O
they	BE
let	IE
you	IP
they	C
'll	C
let	O
you	O
decrease	O
how	O
many	O
hours	O
you	O
work	O
by	O
kind	O
of	O
percentage	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
'll	O
let	O
you	O
work	O

if	BE
you	IE

if	C
you	C

you	O

decrease	O
your	O
number	O

by	O
any	O

just	BE_IP
just	C
about	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
your	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
think	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
get	O
like	O
a	BE_IP
with	O
your	O
extra	O
degrees	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
pay	O
raise	O
due	O

so	O
that	O
will	O
probably	O
help	O
out	O

but	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
health	O

stuff	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	BE
think	IP
i	C
mean	C
that	BE
's	IE
pretty	IP
that	C
's	C
a	C
pretty	C
important	O
uh	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
there	O
because	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
can	O
be	O
really	O
expensive	O
if	O
you	O
ever	O
have	O
any	O
health	O

my	BE

i	C

's	O
uh	O

something	O

i	O

uh-huh	O

they	O

well	O
the	BE

i	C_IE

the	C_IP
i	C
guess	C
the	C

real	O
um	O

i	O
guess	O
you	O
could	O
say	O
working	O
for	O
me	O
working	O
here	O
besides	O
i	O

i	O
'm	O

because	O
i	O
'm	O
at	O
you	O

there	BE

there	C

some	O
weird	O

where	O
uh	O
uh	O
student	O

working	O
for	O
the	O

do	O
n't	O

though	O
that	O
's	O
about	O

so	O

that	O
's	O
about	O
the	O

i	BE

i	O

right	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O

now	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
big	O
win	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O

for	O

and	O
they	O

what	O

the	O

yet	O
i	BE_IP

uh	O

do	O
n't	O
even	O
use	O
a	O

for	O
the	O

uh-huh	O

that	O

uh-huh	O

yes	O

it	O
's	O
pretty	O

it	O
's	O
almo-	O

i	O

you	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

actually	O
i	O

i	O
like	O
using	O

for	O
everything	O
but	O
just	O
paying	O

because	O
that	O

it	O
's	O
a	O

and	O
i	O

to	O

about	O

uh	O

i	O

if	BE
that	IE

a	O

you	O

or	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
to	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O

understand	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O

somebody	O
to	BE_IP
to	C

it	O

it	O
seems	O

it	O
's	O
absurd	O
the	O

the	O

yeah	O

and	O
a	O

them	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP

with	O

a	O

y-	BE_IP
too	O

what	O

many	O
people	O
who	O

if	O
they	O

a	O

they	O

out	O
two	O

because	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
paying	O
attention	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
it	O
seem	O

yeah	O

we	O
have	O
the	O

yeah	O

sure	O

okay	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

do	O
you	O
use	O
a	O
computer	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

mine	O
is	O
really	O
simple	O
because	O
i	O
got	O
all	O
our	O

when	O
uh	O

a	O

i	BE_IP

out	O
a	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
you	O

it	O
's	O

easier	O
you	O

if	O

so	BE_IP
uh	C

the	O

you	O

yeah	O

that	O
was	O
my	O

it	O

i	O

i	O
did	O

you	O

that	O

just	BE_IP
i	C
just	C

that	BE_IP
that	C

uh	O
i	O

no	O

it	O

you	O

you	O

r-	O

all	O
you	O

they	O

you	O

i	O

it	O

that	O

some	O

just	O

someone	O

it	O
's	O

if	O

some	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
mess	O
with	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
use	O
a	O

either	O
you	O

i	BE
do	IE

that	O
mu-	O
that	O
many	O
you	O

so	O

oh	O
yeah	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
a	O

i	O

at	O
n	O
c	O
n	O
b	O
here	O

and	O
they	O
have	O
a	O

that	O
you	O
can	O
call	O

and	O
i	O
always	O
call	O
in	O
and	O
like	O
once	O
every	O
other	O

or	O
so	O

and	O
i	O
will	O
uh	O
check	O

what	O

and	O

do	O
you	O

that	O

you	O

and	O
i	O

and	O
you	O

check	O
my	O

and	O
my	O
book	O
and	BE_IP
you	O

because	O
i	O

exactly	O
what	O
i	O

you	O

i	O
do	O
that	O
real	O
often	O

i	O

that	O

so	O
anyway	O

okay	O

so	O
what	BE
are	IP
what	C
are	C
your	O
views	O
on	O
capital	O

yes	O

so	O
are	O
they	O
currently	BE_IP

capital	O

in	O
your	O

yes	O

that	O
's	O
similar	O
to	O
georgia	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
true	O
considering	O

yes	O

yes	O

uh	O
i	O
guess	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
kind	O
of	O
defeats	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O

capital	O

if	O

yes	O

right	O

that	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
intent	O
of	O
it	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
successful	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
applied	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
expedient	O
manner	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
n't	O
so	O
many	O
appeals	O

yeah	O

if	BE_IP
if	C
the	O
person	O
who	O
's	O

to	O

the	O

that	O
they	O

uh	O
i	O

a	O

i	O

uh	O
f-	O
with	O
georgia	O

um	O

yes	O

um	O

uh-huh	O

um	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
true	O

but	O
i	O
guess	O
there	O
's	O
other	O
factors	O
that	O

but	O
p-	O
p-	O
pumping	O
more	O

is	O
a	O
good	O

it	O
's	O
not	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
difficult	O

um	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
probably	O
true	O

w-	O

um	O
yeah	O

i	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
an	O
easy	O

there	BE

there	C
's	C
no	O
easy	O

for	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
'm	O

it	O

yeah	O

um	O
yeah	O

i	BE

n't	C

certainly	O
capital	O
punishment	O

n't	O

a	O

uh	O

i	O

i	O
am	O
for	O
certain	O
cri-	O

yeah	O

in	O
certain	O
crimes	O

uh	O
premeditated	O
murder	O

of	O
that	O

definitely	O

any	O

um	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
you	O

have	O

yes	O

i	O

about	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
have	O

because	O
i	O

it	O
serves	O
as	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O

we	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
think	O
it	O
is	O

but	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
very	O
expensive	O
to	O

you	O
know	O
texas	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O

uh	O

the	O

a	O

then	O
i	O

this	O

it	O
's	O

i	C

that	C
i	C

this	C

down	O
that	O
it	O

more	O

it	O

the	O

the	O

and	O
all	O
that	O
you	O

well	O
i	O

capital	O

is	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
primarily	O
a	O

to	O
other	O
people	O
you	O

who	O

it	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

what	BE_IP
what	C
kind	O
of	O
work	O
do	O
you	O
do	O

um	O
well	O
see	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
school	O
principal	O

elementary	O

and	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
poor	O
section	O
of	O

with	O
p-	O
predominantly	O
anglo	O

i	O

already	O
that	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
criminals	O
in	O

of	O
everything	O
we	O
can	O
do	O

and	O
see	O
i	O
'm	O
afraid	O
i	O
think	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
take	O
the	O
equivalent	O
amount	O
of	O

and	O
invest	O
it	O
in	O

that	O

i	O

you	O
could	O
n't	O
do	O
that	O
because	O
you	O

to	O
do	O
something	O
with	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
are	O

i	O

we	O

in	O

we	O

about	O

in	BE_IP
in	C

uh	O
i	BE
'm	IE

i	C

a	O

in	BE_IP

in	C
all	O
the	O

it	BE

i	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

and	O
this	O

a	O
very	O

here	O
in	O
tyler	O
who	O

um	O

all	O
over	O
you	O

the	O

they	O

another	O

when	O
the	O

so	O
um	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
do	O
day	O
care	O
centers	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
should	O
make	O
frequent	O

and	O
um	O
to	O
check	O
in	O
on	O
them	O
when	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

it	O

because	O
they	O
do	O
do	O
things	O
differently	O
when	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
around	O

so	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
this	O
one	O
was	O
set	O
up	O
good	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
had	O
two	O
teachers	O
to	O
every	O
room	O
um	O
sometimes	O
three	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
system	O
like	O
so	O
when	O
you	O
walked	O
in	O
everything	O
looks	O
cool	O

the	O
problem	O
i	O
had	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
show	O
affection	O
to	O
the	O
children	O
enough	O

they	O
did	O
not	O
show	O
them	O
care	O
to	O
these	O
small	O
children	O
who	O
are	O
being	O
left	O

um	O
they	O

one	O
time	O
i	O
picked	O
up	O
this	O
little	O
boy	O
who	O
was	O
crying	O

and	O
the	O
owner	O
came	O
and	O
just	O
chewed	O
me	O
up	O
one	O
side	O
down	O
the	O
other	O
you	O
know	O

he	O
said	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
every	O
child	O
in	O
here	O
wanting	O
you	O
to	O
pick	O
them	O
up	O

and	O
i	O
said	O
no	O

this	O
child	O
was	O
crying	O
and	O
needed	O
some	O
comfort	O
you	O
know	O

what	O
is	O
your	O
problem	O

so	O
um	O

yes	O

right	O

they	BE

they	C

um	O
the	BE_IP
the	C_IE

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C

if	O

an-	O

the	BE
other	IP
the	C

but	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O

interesting	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
kind	O

the	O

and	O
i	O

you	O

she	BE

she	C

you	O

but	O
he	O
was	O

the	BE
more	IP
um	C
the	C

uh	O
what	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i-	BE_IP
it	C

that	BE_IP
that	C
it	O

that	BE_IP
that	C

actually	O
i	O

we	O

um	O
like	BE_IP
like	C
europe	O
um	O
england	O
i	O
know	O
the	O
taxes	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
higher	O

but	O
they	O
do	O
have	O
socialized	O
medicine	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
um	O
i	O
know	O
i	O
was	O
reading	O
in	O
the	O

i	O
believe	O
yesterday	O
that	O
um	O
they	O
're	O
talking	O

or	O
maybe	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
radi-	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
anybody	O
pays	O
too	O
little	O

do	O
you	O
get	O
hit	O
up	O
for	O
local	O
taxes	O
there	O

oh	O
so	O
y-	BE_IP
y-	C_IP
you	C
get	O
the	O
whole	O
smorgasbord	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
actually	O
live	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
tax	O
free	O
or	O
die	O
uh-huh	O

no	O

actually	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
sales	O
tax	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
either	O

no	O

what	O
there	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
very	O
high	O
property	O
taxes	O
because	O
that	O
's	O
how	O
they	O
fund	O
schools	O
and	O
everything	O

the	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
i	O
work	O
in	O
massachusetts	O

so	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
hit	O
me	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
five	O
percent	O
there	O

yep	O

but	O
it	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
we	O

it	O
's	O
only	O
a	O
state	O
tax	O
here	O
no	O
local	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
a	O
five	O
percent	O
sales	O
tax	O

but	O
uh	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
so	O
i	O
'm	O
paying	O
state	O
tax	O
even	O
if	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
live	O
here	O

but	O
at	O
least	O
on	O
things	O
like	O
stock	O
options	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
tax	O
me	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
too	O
bad	O

oh	O
i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
mean	C_IE
i	C_IP
i	C
'd	C
consider	O
twenty	O
percent	O
lucky	O
because	O
just	O
on	O
i	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
figure	O
out	O
just	O
on	O
feds	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
actually	O
hit	O
the	O
thirty-one	O
bracket	O
this	O
year	O
which	O
was	O
no	O
fun	O

right	O

and	O
also	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
figure	O
out	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
percent	O
for	O
f	O
i	O
c	O
a	O
which	O
is	O
taxes	O
where	O
you	O

most	O
people	O
forget	O
about	O
them	O
because	O
you	BE

you	C

you	C

your	O
f	O
i	O
c	O
a	O
back	O
at	O
the	O

but	BE_IP
so	C_IP
you	C
know	C
and	C
then	C
you	O
know	O
like	O
a	O
five	O
percent	O
surtax	O
i	O
'm	O
paying	O
forty	O
percent	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
mean	C
i	C
think	O
there	O
's	O
some	O
people	O
there	O
y-	BE_IP
certainly	C
are	O
some	O
things	O
where	O
you	O
need	O
infrastructure	O

and	O
you	BE
need	IP
you	C
n-	C
you	O
know	O

there	O
are	O
things	O
government	O
does	O
better	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
government	O
does	O
a	O
better	O
space	O
program	O
than	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
private	O
individuals	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
things	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
tax	O
subsidies	O
to	O
tobacco	O
farmers	O
because	O
jesse	O
helms	O
wants	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

or	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
and	C_IP
and	C
just	O
tremendous	O
amounts	O
of	O
you	O
know	O

so	O
much	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
service	O
debt	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
going	O
in	BE_IP
into	C_IP
into	C
programs	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

they	BE
are	IP
they	C
are	C
a	O
fat	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
military	O
is	O
really	O
fat	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
h	O
e	O
w	O
services	O
although	O
they	O
're	O
providing	O
necessary	O

have	O
too	O
much	O
fat	O
in	O
them	O

you	O
know	O
like	O
we	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
spend	O
a	O
fortune	O
for	O
things	O
like	O
v	O
a	O
hospitals	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
how	O
well	O
they	O
're	O
managed	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
we	O
're	O
getting	O
our	O
money	O
's	O
work	O
out	O
worth	O
out	O
of	O
there	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
all	O
going	O
into	BE_IP
into	C
bureaucrats	O

well	O
be-	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
reagan	O

yeah	O

the	O
great	O
communicator	O

oh	O
oh	O
yeah	O

they	O
think	O

oh	O
yeah	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
go	O
and	O
say	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
c-	O

congress	O
they	O
're	O
the	O
fault	O
for	O
it	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
other	O
thing	O
is	O
it	O
's	O
tricky	O
though	O

because	O
like	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
they	O
say	O
oh	O
all	O
right	O
let	O
's	O
cut	O
the	O
military	O
budget	O

well	O
yeah	O

then	O
you	O
lose	O
half	O
your	O
jobs	O
in	O
new	O
hampshire	O

you	O
lose	O

grotten	BE_IP
connecticut	C
goes	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
like	C
you	C
know	C
it	C
's	C
very	O
tricky	O
to	O
balance	O
that	O
stuff	O
off	O
because	O
then	O
you	O
hurt	O
you	O
know	O

if	BE
the	IP
if	C_IE
the	C_IP
if	C
people	C
lose	O
their	O
jobs	O
then	O
they	O
become	O
a	O
load	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
contributing	O
taxes	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
very	O
hard	O
to	O
say	O
you	O
know	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
cut	O

who	O
are	O
n't	O
contributing	O

right	O

yeah	O

and	O
uh	O
in	O
our	O

right	O

but	O
what	O
's	O
very	O
funny	O
is	O
in	O
our	O
town	O
meeting	O
they	O
were	O
v-	O

th-	BE_IP
this	C_IP
this	C
guy	O
had	O
both	O
for	O
our	O
school	O
district	O
meeting	O
and	O
our	O
town	O
meeting	O
had	O
this	O
proposal	O
which	O
unfortunately	O
violates	O
new	O
hampshire	O
constitution	O
d-	BE_IP
for	O
our	O
local	O

to	O
do	O
it	O
to	O
uh	O
have	O
you	O

their	O

they	O
say	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
this	O
and	BE
this	IP
and	C_IE
this	C_IP
and	C_IE
this	C_IP
and	C
this	C

course	O
the	O
only	O
problem	O
with	O
that	O
is	O
then	O
nobody	O
paying	O
for	O
the	O
necessary	O

they	O
do	O
n't	O
use	O

yeah	O

no	O

i	O
would	O
tend	O
to	O
agree	O
very	O
highly	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
all	O
paying	O
a	O
little	O

too	O
much	O

and	O
not	O

much	O
good	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

yeah	O

we	O
sure	O
do	O

here	O
in	O

we	BE

uh	C
we	C
pay	C
county	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

we	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

which	O
is	O
probably	O
pretty	O
nice	O

but	O
i	O
'll	O
bet	O
that	O
means	O
your	O
state	O
sales	O
tax	O
is	O
pretty	O
high	O

there	O

i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C
really	O

that	O
here	O

we	O
pay	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
whole	O
uh	O
just	O

uh	O

i	O

right	O

did	O
you	O

c	O
n	O
n	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

uh	O

i	O

uh	IE
uh	IE
a	IE
wesmin-	IP
they	C
call	C
it	O
the	O
westminster	O

uh	O

i	O

it	O
's	O
in	O
new	O

city	O
at	BE
the	IP
at	C
the	C

there	O
once	O
a	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
that	O
on	O
last	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
really	O
kind	O
of	O
something	O
to	O
watch	O
uh	O

it	O
's	O
on	O
i	O
think	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
nights	O
for	O
maybe	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
two	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
weirdest	O

you	O

want	O
to	O
see	O
in	O
there	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
really	O
beautiful	O
too	O

so	O

so	O
you	O
live	O
in	O
utah	O
do	O
you	O

goodness	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
all	O
work	O
for	O
t	O
i	O
or	O
for	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
very	O
first	O
one	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
talked	O
to	O

uh-huh	O

so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
your	O
current	O
event	O
information	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
would	O
imagine	O
going	O
to	O
college	O
though	O
your	O
professors	O
and	O
different	O
things	O

you	O
keep	O
up	O
on	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

yeah	O

right	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
a	O
housewife	O

i	O
have	O
three	O
kids	O

and	O
so	O
um	O
i	O
get	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
information	O
probably	O
through	O
just	O
the	O
news	O
at	O
six	O
o'clock	O
and	O
then	O
um	O
talking	O
with	O
people	O
and	O
just	O
hearing	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

just	O
the	O
regular	O
channel	O
just	O
channel	O
eight	O

that	O
's	O
our	O
channel	O
here	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
um	O
eyewitness	O
news	O

so	O

oh	O
uh-huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
elections	O
they	O
choose	O
who	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
follow	O
and	O
who	O
they	O
're	O
not	O

and	O
basically	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
a	O
candidate	O
can	O
get	O
them	O
to	O
follow	O
then	O
the	O
news	O
will	O
you	O
know	O
kind	O
of	O
publicize	O
his	O
name	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
way	O
i	O
get	O
the	O
news	O
is	O
the	O
right	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
it	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
very	O
lopsided	O
picture	O
of	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

right	O

right	O

and	O
the	O
news	O
too	O
it	O
just	O
does	O
n't	O
um	O
cover	O
that	O
many	O
stories	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
just	O
covers	O
your	O
basic	O
you	O
know	O
violent	O
crimes	O
and	BE_IP
you	C_IE
know	C_IE
and	C_IP
and	C
your	O
ca-	O
catastrophes	O
with	O
weather	O
and	O
stuff	O

but	O
other	O
than	O
that	O
you	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
on	O

um	O
i	O
will	O
read	O
our	O
current	O
letters	O
that	O
come	O
out	O
on	O
elections	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
read	O
that	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
study	O
who	O
's	O
running	O
in	O
our	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
study	O
what	O
's	O
going	O

in	O
the	O

it	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
read	O
other	O
magazines	O
um	O
too	O
to	O
get	O
my	O

right	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
read	O
every	O
month	O
a	O
reader	O
's	O

but	O
um	O
now	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
just	O
have	O
friends	O
that	O
clip	O

or	O
if	O
i	O
you	O

during	BE
the	IP
w-	C_IP
when	C

i	O

just	O
a	O
little	O
in	O

to	O
find	O

a	O

wow	O

did	O
he	O
raise	O
him	O
or	O
something	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
interesting	O

huh	O
we	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
mutt	O

well	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
named	O
it	O
hooper	O
because	O
that	O
's	O
where	O
we	O

it	O
from	O

uh	O
some	O
lady	O
she	O
uh	O

a	O

uh	O
uh	O

at	O
her	O
house	O

and	O
she	O
use	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
veter-	O
veterinarian	O

so	O
she	O
would	O
spay-	BE_IP
uh	C_IE
neuter	C_IE
them	C_IP
give	C
them	C
all	O
their	O

and	O
we	O
saw	O
an	O
ad	O
saying	O
it	O
was	O
free	O

so	O
we	O
went	O
down	O
there	O
and	O
picked	O
it	O
up	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
been	O
an	O
excellent	O

it	O
's	O
my	O

my	O

here	O
at	O
home	O
alone	O
while	O
i	O
go	O
to	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
mostly	O
why	O
we	O

they	O

uh	O

i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
animal	O

but	O
he	O
just	O

a	O
few	O
the	O
animals	O
in	O

and	O
some	O
he	O
destroys	O

and	O
some	O
he	O

so	O
we	O
took	O
him	O
up	O
there	O

and	O
he	O
ended	O
up	O
keeping	O
him	O

uh	O
cause	O
he	O

him	O
for	O
six	O

we	BE_IP
we	C

him	O
just	O
about	O
a	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
thought	O
boy	O
that	O
sure	O
looks	O
like	O
that	O
pup	O
we	O
gave	O
away	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
asked	O
him	O
about	O
it	O
one	O

and	O
he	O
said	O
yeah	O

he	O
's	O
been	O
the	O

i	O

just	O

i	BE_IP
he	C

a	O
great	O
great	O
dog	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
here	O
in	O
saskatoon	O
uh	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
curb	O
pick	O
up	O
of	O
uh	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
recycled	O

uh	O
we	O
're	O
in	O
a	O
community	O
of	O
about	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
eighty	O
thousand	O
people	O

uh	O
there	O
are	O
areas	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
uh	O

actually	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
the	O
uh	O
handicapped	O
societies	O
types	O
of	O
places	O
where	O
the	O
uh	O
one	O
they	O
do	O
as	O
just	O
a	O
recycling	O
operation	O
and	O
then	O
others	O
they	O
collect	O
the	O
paper	O
and	O
ship	O
it	O
to	O
other	O
retailers	O

so	O
uh	O
we	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
uh	O
have	O
drop	O
off	O
bins	O
for	O
news	O
papers	O
and	O
cardboard	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

and	O
then	O
there	BE
are	IP
there	C
's	C
a	O
uh	O
deposit	O
program	O
on	O
plastic	O
and	O
glass	O
containers	O
well	O
primarily	O
soft	O
drink	O
bottles	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
are	O
able	O
uh	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
uh	O
rehabilitation	O
centers	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
recycle	O
the	O
containers	O

they	O
refund	O
the	O
deposit	O
which	O
is	O
anywhere	O
from	O
five	O
to	O
fifteen	O
cents	O
a	O
container	O

and	O
then	O

right	O

on	BE
the	IP
on	C_IE
primarily	C_IP
on	C
soft	C
drink	O
pops	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
so	C
they	O
induce	O
recycling	O
of	O
plastic	O
and	O
glass	O
soft	O
drink	O
containers	O

uh	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
scrape	O
metal	O
dealers	O
that	O
will	O
accept	O
tin	O
and	O
aluminum	O
cans	O
as	O
well	O

and	O
actually	O
the	O
recycler	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
deposit	O
on	O
aluminum	O
pop	O
cans	O
and	O
beer	O
cans	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
recycler	O
uh	O
with	O
the	O
handicapped	O
group	O
will	O
also	O
accept	O
those	O

so	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
fairly	BE_IP
fairly	C
extensive	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
it	BE
's	IP
uh	C
it	C
's	C
the	O
initiative	O
of	O
the	O
individual	O
person	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
coordinated	O
pick	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
city	O

well	O
actually	O
there	BE
's	IP
there	C
's	C
the	O
opportunity	O
for	O
both	O

generally	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C
handicapped	O
group	O
takes	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O

actually	O
the	O

has	O
placed	O
the	O
deposit	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
inducement	O
to	O
re-	BE_IP
recycle	C
the	O
bottle	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
your	O

back	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
recycler	O
run	O
by	O
the	O

society	O
pays	O
back	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
that	O

and	BE
then	IE
i	IP
and	C
then	C
they	C
in	O
turn	O
will	O
get	O
some	O
money	O
from	O
the	O
bottlers	O
and	O
from	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
people	O
that	O
do	O
the	O
canning	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
beer	O
as	BE_IP
as	C
well	O

oh	O
yeah	O

uh	O
i	O
guess	O
partly	O
because	O
of	O
our	O
climate	O

here	O
in	O
saskatoon	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
central	O
uh	O

well	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
central	O
canada	O

but	O
central	O
canada	O
tends	O
to	O
referred	O
more	O
to	O
ontario	O
and	O
quebec	O

but	O
uh	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
call	O
them	O
homeless	O
people	O

we	O
certainly	O
have	O
a	O
fair	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
on	O
welfa-	O
welfare	O
and	O
unemployment	O
insurance	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

uh	O
there	O
's	O
psychological	O
pressure	O
against	O
employing	O
people	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
although	O
uh	O
scouts	O
and	O

and	O

teams	O
those	O
kinds	O
uh	O
regularly	O
do	O

where	O
they	O

around	O
in	O

and	O
collect	O
the	O

at	O
individual	O

they	O
have	O
done	O
it	BE_IP
some	C
uh	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
actually	O
quite	O
an	O
extensive	O
network	O
of	O

they	O
are	O
actually	O
at	O
virtually	O
all	O

there	O
are	O
several	O

where	O
the	O

uh	O
some	O

the	O

hey	O
steve	O

uh	O
they	BE
just	IP
uh	C
they	C
just	C
started	O
a	O

here	O
i	O
think	O

actually	O
this	O
is	O
my	O
first	O
experience	O
with	O
recycling	O
program	O

but	O
uh	O
instead	O
of	O
just	O
like	O
tossing	O
everything	O
away	O
which	O
i	O
always	O
felt	O
bad	O
about	O
uh	O
i	O
am	O
starting	O
to	O
split	BE_IP
stu-	C_IP
split	C
stuff	O
up	O

the	O
only	O
disadvantage	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
curb	O

they	O
make	O
me	O

it	O
like	O
a	O

down	O
the	O

and	O
spit	O
it	O
out	O
down	O
there	O

what	O
are	O
they	O
doing	O
up	O
there	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

only	O
on	O

okay	O

okay	O

oh	O
okay	O

so	O
did	O
they	O

you	BE
're	IE

you	C

these	O

the	O

and	O
the	O

is	O
getting	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C

or	BE_IP
or	C_IP

they	C
some	O

the	O

back	O
to	O
you	O

oh	O
okay	O

that	O
's	O
very	O
cool	O

you	O
know	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
i	O
heard	O
about	O
a	O
similar	O
program	O
in	O
new	O

city	O
where	O
uh	O
a	O
thing	O
called	O
like	O
homeless	O

or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
is	O
employ	O
uh	O
homeless	O
i	O
think	O
mostly	O
men	O
but	O
homeless	O
people	O
to	O
uh	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
collect	O
all	O
the	O
recyclable	O
cans	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
cans	O

there	O
may	O
be	O
bottles	O
as	O
well	O
but	O
like	O
beer	O
cans	O
soda	O
cans	O
and	O
what	O
not	O

and	O
they	O
uh	O
bring	O
them	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
one	O
lo-	O
one	O

and	O
uh	O
are	O

from	O
the	O

uh	C
and	C
get	O
more	O

yeah	O

do	O
they	O

i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C

a-	BE_IP
actually	C
a	O

of	O

because	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
my	O
fiance	O

well	O
she	O
was	O
unemployed	O
for	O
a	O

so	O
she	O
you	O

really	O
needed	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
want-	O

and	O
so	O
often	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
tr-	O
the	O

a	O

uh	C
and	C
when	O
you	O

a	O

of	O
this	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

definitely	O
gone	O
down	O
in	O
the	O

uh	O
i	O

they	BE_IP
they	C

it	O
's	O

the	O

it	O

at	O

sometimes	O

but	O
i	O

no	BE

i	O

we	O

otherwise	O
that	O

i	O

all	O

to	BE_IP

the	O

again	O
i	O

it	O

a	O

i	O
really	O

sometimes	O
they	O
very	O
early	O
on	O
are	O
around	O
lots	O
of	O
other	O
children	O

and	O
they	BE_IP

you	O

i	O

i	O

we	O

everybody	BE_IP
everybody	C

i	BE_IP
i	C

the	O

you	O

there	O
should	O
be	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
curbside	O

that	O
's	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
i	O

really	O

uh-huh	O

during	O
the	O

the	O
around	O
where	O
i	O
live	O
the	O
uh	O
homeless	O
people	O
see-	O

i	O
mean	O
they	O
all	O
have	O
like	O

and	O
stuff	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
go	O
around	O
and	O
collect	O
cans	O
and	O
aluminum	O
and	O
stuff	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
used	O
to	O
just	O
save	O
them	O
up	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
'd	O
come	O
around	O

and	O
we	O
'd	O
give	O
them	O
to	O
them	O

but	O
when	O

during	O
the	O
winter	O
time	O
i	O
think	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
move	O
south	O
or	O
something	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
do	O
that	O
anymore	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
recycling	O
at	O
georgia	O

that	O
uh	O
outside	O
the	O
uh	O
student	O

they	O
never	O
empty	O
those	O

they	O
just	O

so	O
what	O
's	O
a	O

you	O

i	O
asked	O

really	O

that	O

the	C

the	O

you	O

so	O

tablets	O

i	O
think	O
we	O
should	O
just	O
abandon	O
the	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
the	C
written	O
word	O
altogether	O
you	O
know	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O

kind	O
of	O
radical	O
i	O

but	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

everyone	O
had	O
a	O
two	O
way	O
wrist	O
watch	O
t	O
v	O
-s	O
on	O
their	O

like	O
uh	O
dick	O
tracy	O

okay	O
eric	O

uh	O
are	O
you	O
married	O

and	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
family	O

okay	O

and	BE
do	IE
you	IP
and	C
your	C
wife	C
have	O
a	O
budget	O
plan	O
for	O
your	O
finances	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
see	O
uh	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
basically	O
what	O
we	O
do	O

uh	O
about	O
every	BE_IP
every	C
three	O
months	O
or	O
so	O
we	O
re-evaluate	O
our	O
budget	O

and	O
we	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
just	O
write	O
from	O
the	O
largest	O
bills	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
smallest	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
divvy	O
them	O
up	O
between	O
our	O
four	O
pay	O
checks	O

i	O
work	O
part	O
time	O
at	O
night	O

and	BE
he	IE
works	IP
and	C
my	C
husband	C
works	O
full	O
times	O
days	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
have	O
four	O
checks	O

but	O
that	O
works	O
out	O
nice	O
because	O
we	O
get	O
paid	O
every	O
week	O

and	O
so	O
that	O
does	O
help	O

that	O
helps	O
a	O
lot	O

and	O
then	O
uh	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
ex-	O
extra	O
for	O
extra	O
spending	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
well	O
ear	O
marked	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

every	O
penny	O
is	O
ear	O
marked	O

but	O
uh	O
it	BE_IP
we	C
have	O
found	O
that	O
works	O
the	O
best	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
so	C
if	O
we	O
can	O
just	O
divide	O
them	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
major	O
bills	O
up	O

in	O
fact	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
easier	O
to	O
divide	O
the	O
major	O
bills	O
up	O
you	O
know	O
cut	O
the	O
house	O
payment	O
in	O
half	O
and	O
cut	O
the	O
loan	O
payment	O
in	O
half	O

but	BE_IP
and	C
divide	O
those	O
up	O
between	O
all	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
taking	O
a	O
huge	O
sum	O
out	O
out	O
of	O
one	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
next	O
pay	O
check	O
we	O
're	O
real	O
short	O

or	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
helps	O
you	O
to	O
focus	O
where	O
your	O
money	O
goes	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
i	O
am	O
sure	O
you	O
felt	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
same	O
frustration	O
before	O
you	O
got	O
on	O
a	O
budget	O

but	O
you	O
're	O
wondering	O
my	O
when	O
you	O
put	O
down	O
all	O
the	O
money	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
bring	O
in	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
saying	O
my	O
word	O
where	O
did	O
all	O
that	O
money	O
go	O

where	O
does	O
it	O
go	O

uh	O

and	O
also	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
write	O
down	O

and	O
we	O
did	O
this	O

we	O
are	O
not	O
real	O
consistent	O
with	O
this	O

but	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
month	O

and	O
we	O
wrote	O
down	O
everything	O
that	O
we	O
bought	O
when	O
you	O
know	O
every	O
pay	O
check	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
where	O
every	O
penny	O
went	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
interesting	O
to	O
see	O
just	O
what	O
you	O
do	O
spend	O

and	O
like	O
i	O
say	O
we	O
have	O
n't	O
been	O
real	O
consistent	O
with	O
it	O

it	O
's	O

we	O
should	O
cause	O
it	O
does	O
help	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

wel-	BE_IP
just	C
stick	O
to	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
is	O

yeah	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
sounds	O
like	O
a	O
really	O
good	O
idea	O

and	O
it	O
really	O
helpful	O

uh	O
have	O
you	O
developed	O
a	O
savings	O
plan	O
or	O
i	O
r	O
a	O
s	O
or	O
anything	O

that	O
yet	O

oh	O
uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
good	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
feeling	O

my	O
husband	O
just	O
graduated	O
from	O
the	O
university	O
uh	O
a	O
year	O
ago	O

so	O
finally	O
finally	O
we	O
are	O
getting	O
to	O
that	O
point	O
too	O

so	O
are	O
you	O
still	O
going	O
to	O

or	O

uh	O
yes	O
i	O
am	O
to	O
uh	O
both	O
questions	O

uh	O
yeah	O

we	O
do	O

we	O
uh	O
uh	O

basically	O
there	O
's	O
the	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
the	C
expenses	O
that	O
are	O
fixed	O
during	O
the	BE
month	IP
you	C
know	C
the	C
ones	C
that	O
come	O
every	BE_IP
every	C

and	O
we	O
uh	O
enter	O
those	O
into	BE_IP
uh	C
into	C
a	O
spread	O
sheet	O

and	O
uh	O
whatever	O
is	O
left	O
uh	O
after	O
that	O
we	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
we	C
sit	O
down	O
and	O
agree	O
on	O
kind	O
of	O
what	BE_IP
what	C
sort	O
of	O
range	O
we	O
are	O
going	BE
to	IP
generally	C
going	C
to	C
shoot	O
for	O

so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
do	O

uh-huh	O

wow	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

all	O
allocated	O
out	O

yeah	O

all	O
the	O
checks	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

we	O
found	O
that	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
definitely	O
helped	O
uh	O
get	O
a	O
handle	O
on	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
unnecessary	O
expenses	O

we	BE
were	IP
before	C
we	C
started	C
doing	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
thing	O
we	O
were	O
uh	O
spending	O
uh	O
money	O
for	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

we	O
kind	O
of	O
tended	O
to	O
eat	O
out	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
than	O
we	O
should	O
have	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
uh	O
let	O
things	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
hand	O

we	O
thought	BE
it	IP
uh	C
thought	C
it	C
to	O
be	O
really	O
helpful	O

we	O
have	O
gotten	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
loans	O
paid	O
off	O
really	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

so	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O

but	O

yeah	O

but	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

the	BE
other	IP
the	C
other	C
thing	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
we	O
've	O
found	O
that	O
helps	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
tend	O
to	O
fudge	O
on	O
the	O
budget	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
to	O
uh	O
uh	O
get	O
up	O
the	O
money	O
in	O

and	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
uh	O
uh	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
you	O

unreasonably	O
high	O

or	O
whatever	O
just	O
put	O
it	O
in	BE_IP
uh	C
in	C
an	O

or	O
whatever	O

and	O
that	O
way	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
forced	O
us	O

no	O

i	O
only	O

it	O
probably	O
two	O
or	O
three	O

and	O
then	O

and	O
that	O

of	O
the	O

i	O

very	O

my	O

th-	BE_IP

and	O

some	C
people	C
from	O

i	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

a	O

i	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
problem	O
because	O
i	O
exercise	O
you	O
know	O

i	O

are	O
always	O
saying	O
to	O
me	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
stay	O
thin	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
because	O
i	O
exercise	O

but	O
i	O
also	O
watch	O
what	O
i	O
eat	O
you	O

but	O
you	O
'll	O
come	O

being	O

you	O

really	O
have	O
to	O

about	O
your	O

and	O
that	O
yet	O

but	O
as	O
you	O
get	O

you	O
will	O

well	O
it	O
might	O
not	O

mine	O

because	O
everybody	O
's	O
been	O
telling	O
me	O
that	O
too	O

and	O
so	O
far	O
it	O
has	O
n't	O
happened	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
just	O
feel	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
constantly	O
weigh	O
yourself	O
and	O
just	O
keep	O
an	O
eye	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
cut	O
back	O
if	O
it	O
starts	O
to	O
get	O
you	O
know	O
too	O
high	O

yeah	O

but	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
play	O
any	O
other	O
sports	O
but	O
basketball	O

but	O
do	O
you	O
ski	O

being	O
in	O
utah	O
i	O
was	O
wondering	O
if	O
you	O
ski	O

oh	O
did	O
it	O
really	O

cause	O
i	O
know	O
that	O
skiing	O
in	O
utah	O
is	BE_IP
is	C
suppose	O
to	O
be	O
great	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
never	O
skied	O
before	O

but	O
i	O
have	O
friends	O
that	O
go	O
to	O
utah	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
they	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
really	O

and	O
they	O
ski	O

i	O
guess	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
ski	O

well	O
is	O
it	O
tahoe	O
where	O
you	O
ski	O
from	O

no	O

that	O
's	O
nevada	O
to	O
california	O
i	O
guess	O

yeah	O

i	O
am	O
thinking	O
about	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
ski	O
over	O
the	O
state	O
line	O

but	O
there	BE
's	IE
a	IE
fun-	IP
there	C
is	C
a	C
place	C
in	O
utah	O
called	O
a	O
funny	O
name	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
oh	O
heavenly	O

is	O
that	O
it	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
called	O
heavenly	O

you	O
've	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
that	O

well	O
maybe	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
in	O
utah	O

but	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
've	O
skied	O
heavenly	O

and	O
it	O
sounded	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
skied	O
really	O
well	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
actually	O
talking	O
about	O
a	O
place	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
funny	O

oh	O
yeah	O

you	O
can	O
get	O
really	O
sore	O

i	O
know	O
you	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
've	O
talked	O
to	O
people	O

but	O
most	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
ski	O
enough	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
sore	O

and	O
then	O
is	O
it	O
your	O
quadriceps	O
that	O
are	O
the	O
worst	O

in	O
your	O
legs	O
and	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
strange	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
like	O
i	O
did	O
aerobics	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
then	O
i	O
went	O
horseback	O
riding	O

and	O
still	O
i	O
was	O
so	O
sore	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
n't	O
get	O
over	O

okay	O

so	O
frank	BE_IP
what	C
uh	O
type	O
of	O
uh	O
budget	O
do	O
you	O
or	O
your	O
family	O
have	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
uh	O
sounds	O
like	O
probably	O
a	O
tighter	O
controlled	O
budget	O
than	O
what	O
i	O
have	O

i	O
am	O
single	O

so	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
's	O
an	O
excuse	O
for	O
not	O
having	O
a	O
tight	O
budget	O

but	O
i	O
basically	O

right	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O

i	O
am	O
the	O
only	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
track	O
of	O

so	O
it	O
makes	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
easier	O

uh	O
and	O
also	O
i	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
i	C
try	O
to	O
save	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
each	O
month	O
as	O
well	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
try	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
what	O
my	O
expenses	O
are	O

and	O
i	O
am	O
pretty	O
consistent	O
from	O
month	O
to	O
month	O

and	O
uh	O
whenever	O
uh	O
i	O
need	O
to	O
uh	O
whenever	O
that	O
changes	O
i	O
am	O
pretty	O
well	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O
without	O
actually	O
having	O
to	O
maintain	O
a	O
budget	O
for	O
it	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
do	O
a	O
similar	O
thing	O
more	O
uh	O
medium	O
or	O
longer	O
range	O

i	O
just	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
maybe	C
a	C
targeted	O
amount	O
that	O
i	O
will	O
save	O
for	O

like	O
i	O
am	O

probably	O
within	O
a	O
year	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
new	O
car	O

so	O
i	O
kind	O
of	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
an	C
amount	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O

and	O
i	O
am	O
making	O
every	O
effort	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
sal-	BE_IP
put	C
a	O
little	O
bit	O
away	O
and	O
increase	O
the	O
amount	O
that	O
i	O
need	O
for	O
a	O
down	O
payment	O
or	O
whatever	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

huh	O
right	O

right	O

have	O
you	O
thought	O
about	O
uh	O
leasing	O

i	O
see	O

right	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
rolling	O
it	O
over	O
every	O
three	O
years	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
advantageous	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
typically	BE
you	IP
if	C
you	C
purchase	O
your	O
own	O
car	O
you	O
tend	O
to	O
make	O
uh	O
the	O
best	O
returns	O
after	O
you	O
pay	O
it	O
off	O

of	O
course	O
the	O
longer	O
you	O
keep	O
it	O
beyond	O
that	O
point	O
the	O
more	O
profitable	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
own	O
it	O
yourself	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

yeah	O

mine	O
's	O
uh	O
seven	O
years	O
old	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
last	O
year	O
was	BE_IP
that	C
was	C
a	O
rough	O
year	O
for	O
it	O

i	O
had	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
expenses	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
am	O
hoping	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
the	O

as	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
number	O
of	O
miles	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
get	O
everything	O
replaced	O
brakes	O
shocks	O
and	O
all	O
that	O

so	O
i	O
just	O
went	O
through	O
that	O
whole	O
set	O
last	O
year	O

i	O
hope	O
that	O
i	O
only	O
have	O
a	O
slow	O
period	O
before	O
i	O
do	O
that	O
again	O

right	O

right	O

what	O
line	O
of	O
work	O
are	O
you	O
in	O

well	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
we	O

a	O

i	O
am	O
in	O
my	O

before	O
we	O

to	O

a	O
very	O
strict	O

i	O
had	O
four	O

and	O
uh	O
you	O

we	O

kind	O
of	O
anticipate	O
how	O

things	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
be	O

uh	O
i	O
guess	O
one	O
interesting	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O

i	O
do	O
now	O
is	O
that	O
i	BE

uh	C

uh	O
every	O
six	O

i	O

i	O

what	O

an	O

a	O

i	O

two	O

i	O

then	O
when	O
the	O

comes	O
in	O
i	O
've	O

that	O
much	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
budgeting	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh	O
cars	O
are	O
definitely	O
something	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
figure	O
into	O
your	O
budget	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
buying	O
them	O
but	O
for	O
keeping	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
too	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
've	O
got	O
two	O
cars	O

my	O
wife	O
has	O
a	O
car	O

and	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
drive	O
pick	O
up	O
truck	O

so	O
we	O
are	O
on	O
a	O
schedule	O
where	O
i	O
try	O
every	O
uh	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
years	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
buy	O
a	O
new	O
one	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
am	O
constantly	O
making	O
car	O
payments	O

but	O
i	O
figure	O
that	O
's	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
anyway	O
is	O
making	O
car	O
payments	O

so	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
get	O
one	O
paid	O
for	O

and	O
uh	O
actually	O
i	O
am	O

up	O
for	O
another	O
one	O

so	O
it	BE

you	C
know	C
it	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
a	O
never	O
ending	O
thing	O

but	O
you	BE
try	IE
to	IP
you	C
try	C
to	C
schedule	O
those	O
things	O
so	O
that	O
uh	O
you	BE
only	IP
you	C
're	C
not	O
paying	O
for	O
two	O
of	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
i	O
guess	O
is	O
what	O
i	O
am	O
saying	O

well	O
uh	O
i	O
have	O
thought	O
about	O
it	O

but	O
leasing	O
would	O
n't	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
my	O
business	O

my	O
wife	O
uses	O
hers	O
just	O
for	O
pleasure	O

and	O
i	O
use	O
mine	O
just	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
and	O
forth	O
to	O
work	O
which	O
is	O
only	O
ten	O
miles	O
away	O

so	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O

uh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

yeah	O

you	O
're	O
right	O

uh	O
i	O
have	O
uh	O
been	O
know	O
to	O
keep	O
trucks	O
or	O
cars	O
for	O
oh	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
years	O

but	O
i	O
find	O
that	O
after	O
about	O
four	O
years	O
they	O
kind	O
of	O
start	O
going	O
down	O
hill	O

and	O
you	O
got	O
to	O
put	BE_IP
put	C
stuff	O
in	O
them	O
you	O
know	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

those	O
things	O
can	O
really	O
upset	O
your	O
budget	O
when	BE
they	IP
when	C
they	C
come	O
in	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
nice	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
set	O
aside	O
for	BE
the	IP
for	C
the	C
unexpected	O
shall	O
we	O
say	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
uh	O
kill	O
you	O
all	O
in	O
one	O
month	O

how	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
the	O
viet	O
nam	O
war	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
saw	O
that	O
as	O
well	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
were	O
you	O
ever	O
in	O
viet	O
nam	O

or	O

um	O
i	O
was	O
much	O
too	O
young	O

i	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
sixty-seven	O

so	O

um	O
you	O
know	O
both	BE
my	IP
well	C
both	C
my	C
brothers	O
were	O
um	O
draft	O
age	O

but	O
neither	O
of	O
them	O
wound	O
up	O
going	O
over	O
which	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
happy	O
for	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
um	O
so	O
well	O
do	BE
you	IP
do	C
you	C
feel	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
over	O
there	O

okay	O

um	O
do	BE
you	IE
think	IP
i	C
mean	C
do	C
you	C
think	C
our	O
invest-	O
the	O
investment	O
in	O
lives	O
and	O
money	O
was	O
worth	O
it	O

i	O
totally	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O
um	O

what	BE_IP
what	C
effects	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
had	O
on	O
our	O
country	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
typical	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
entire	O
entire	O
involvement	O
over	O
that	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
that	C
nothing	O
was	O
really	O
addressed	O

it	BE
was-	IP
it	C_IE
was	C_IE
n't	C_IP
you	C
know	C
it	C
was	C
never	C

we	BE_IP
we	C
announced	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
war	O

it	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
gradual	O
and	O
subtle	O
you	O
know	O
thi-	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
increasement	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
force	O
that	O

i	O
vaguely	O
remember	O
we	BE_IP
um	C_IE
we	C_IP
had	IE
a	IP
we	C
had	C
a	C
um	O
spy	O
ship	O
torpedoed	O
or	O
something	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O
um	O

so	O
um	O
do	BE_IP
do	C_IP
do	C
you	O
think	O
that	O
like	O
uh	O
um	O
for	O
example	O
like	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
this	O
past	O
war	O
in	O
the	O
persian	O
gulf	O
war	O
that	BE_IP
uh	C
that	C
you	O
see	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
bush	O
was	O
going	BE_IP
going	C
to	O
extraordinary	O
lengths	O
to	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
prepare	O
the	O
country	O
for	O
war	O

yeah	O

okay	O

uh	O
i	O
was	O
n't	O
really	O
keeping	O
count	O

but	O
i	O
guess	O

good-bye	O

bye	O

huh	O
well	O
um	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
deep	O
feelings	O
uh	O

i	O
just	O
uh	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
rented	O
uh	O
the	O
movie	O
what	O
is	O
it	O
good	O
morning	O
viet	O
nam	O

and	O
uh	O

got	O
that	O
uh	O
uh	O
some	O
insight	O
there	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
kind	O
of	O
help	O
me	O
put	O
together	O
the	O
feelings	O

i	O
really	O
appreciated	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
whole	O
uh	O
english	O
class	O
where	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C
uh	O
fellow	O
just	O
would	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
guy	O
's	O
gouging	O
gouging	O
your	O
eyes	O
out	O

what	O
are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
do	O

you	O
know	O
what	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
finish	O
me	O
off	O

and	O
uh	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
was	O
uh	O
good	O
to	O
remember	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C_IE
that	C_IP
that	C
kind	O
of	O
asian	O
philosophy	O
that	O
uh	O

no	O

no	O

i	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
in-between	O
uh	O
finally	O
drew	O
a	O
high	O
draft	O
number	O

and	O
you	O

oh	O

well	O
i	BE_IP
personally	C
uh	C
you	C
know	C
uh	C
i	C
just	O
went	O
in	O
limbo	O

i	O
had	O
a	O
passport	O
and	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
or	O
um	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
or	O
join	O
special	O
forces	O
either	O
one	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
just	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O

so	O
uh	O

um	O
yeah	O

just	O
a	O
second	O

okay	O

sure	O

now	O
well	O
mark	O
um	O
what	O
was	O
that	O
again	O

no	O

not	BE_IP
not	C
really	O

um	O

downside	O
um	O
uh	O
well	O

the	O
says	O
we	O
should	O
uh	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
grief	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
's	C
there	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
presidents	O
have	O
always	O
avoided	O
that	O
as	O
a	O
country	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
serious	O
really	O
you	O
know	O

lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
n't	O
being	O
addressed	O

yeah	O

gulf	O
of	O
tonkin	O
uh	O
resolution	O

and	O
was	O
it	O
a	O
dolphin	O
or	O
a	O
torpedo	O

you	O
remember	O
that	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

only	BE_IP
only	C
it	O
was	O
foggy	O

and	O
finally	O
president	O
johnson	O
said	O
well	O
they	O
're	O
were	O
n't	O
really	O
sure	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
dolphin	O
or	O
a	O
torpedo	O

is	O
n't	O
that	O
something	O

uh-huh	O

hey	O
mark	O
i	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
go	O
um	O

we	O
'll	O
see	O
you	O

i	O
guess	O
our	O
five	O
minutes	O
are	O
up	O
according	O
to	O
me	O

are	O
they	O
to	O
you	O

yeah	O

okay	O

bye-bye	O

okay	O

so	O
uh	O
mike	O
what	O
are	O
your	O
opinions	O
on	O
uh	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
seems	O
to	O
make	O
sense	O

but	O
leave	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
more	O
experienced	O
person	O
who	O
knows	O
how	O
it	O
fits	O
into	O
the	O
uh	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
rate	O
for	O
different	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

right	O

th-	BE_IP
they	C
ha-	O

right	O

well	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
setting	O
like	O
well	O
for	O
example	O
a	O
car	O
type	O
accident	O
where	BE_IP
uh	C
or	C
some	O
incident	O
where	O
someone	O
loses	O
a	O
limb	O

do	O
you	O
think	O
the	O
jury	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
dollar	O
figure	O
for	O
losing	O
an	O
arm	O
a	O
dollar	O
figure	O
for	O
losing	O
different	O
body	O
parts	O

uh-huh	O

huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

right	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

huh	O

oh	O
out	O
of	O
thei-	O
r-	O

as	O
opposed	O
to	O
the	O
corporat-	O
insurance	O
paying	O
the	O
bills	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
we	O
're	O

wh-	BE_IP
who	C_IP
who	C

do	BE
they	IE
get	IP
they	C_IE
get	C_IE
insured	C_IP
they	C
get	C
insured	C
from	O
other	O
insurance	O
companies	O

or	O
how	O
does	O
that	O
work	O

oh	O
okay	O

your	O
talking	O
about	O
corpor-	O

sure	O

okay	O

well	O

but	O
in	O
some	O
instances	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
put	O
companies	O
out	O
of	O
business	O
by	O
taking	O
that	O
stance	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
retained	O
earnings	O

that	O

for	O
oh	O
th-	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

that	O
will	O

huh	O

sure	O

okay	O

well	O
i	O
work	O
for	O
an	O
insurance	O
company	O

so	O
i	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
uh	O
verdicts	O
that	O
are	O
pretty	O
crazily	O
decided	O
um	O
by	O
juries	O
particularly	O

and	O
i	O
know	O
in	O
england	O
the	O
judges	O
set	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
awards	O

you	O
know	O
juries	O
will	O
decide	O
the	O
guilt	O
or	O
innocence	O

but	O
then	O
they	O
leave	O
the	O
awards	O
up	O
to	O
more	O
learned	O
people	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
maybe	O
that	O
avoids	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
totally	O
ridiculous	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
millions	O
and	O
millions	O
of	O
dollars	O

oh	O
exactly	O

each	O
individual	O
jury	O
really	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
perception	O
of	O
what	O
um	O
the	O
going	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
will	O
the	O
going	O
uh	O
award	O
should	O
be	O
for	O
a	O
certain	O
type	O
of	O
case	O
you	O
know	O
within	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
range	O

when	O
you	O
get	O
one	O
way	O
out	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
then	O
really	O
does	O
n't	O
pen-	O
wind	O
up	O
penalizing	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
after	O

who	O
it	O
really	O
penalizes	O
is	O
their	O
insurance	O
company	O
which	O
then	O
translates	O
into	O
higher	O
rates	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
if	O
they	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
mega	O
awards	O
against	O
them	O

you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
sit	O
there	O
and	O
lose	O
money	O

if	O
they	O
are	O
losing	O
money	O
then	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
raise	O
rates	O

so	O
it	O
all	O
comes	O
filtering	O
down	O
to	O
us	O
all	O
in-	O
individually	O

and	O
uh	O
granted	O
some	O
people	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
compensated	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
really	O
been	O
wronged	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

you	O
know	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
health	O
insurance	O
is	O
written	O
that	O
way	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O
buy	O
an	O
accident	O
and	O
death	O
or	O
dismemberment	O
policy	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
s-	BE_IP
pre	C_IP
specified	C
in	O
the	O
policy	O
so	O
much	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
necessarily	O
put	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
value	O
on	O
somebody	O
's	O
limb	O
uh	O
arbitrarily	O
that	O
is	O
always	O
going	O
to	O
fit	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O

i	O
think	O
maybe	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
uh	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
and	O
their	O
station	O
in	O
life	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
uh	O
how	O
much	O
longer	O
they	O
have	O
of	O
work	O
years	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
up	O
you	O
know	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
that	O

i	O
mean	O
maybe	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
award	O
an	O
eighty-five	O
year	O
old	O
guy	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
award	O
a	O
twenty-one	O
year	O
old	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
common	O
sense	O
applied	O
there	O

and	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
where	O
the	O
judiciary	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
learned	O
about	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
thing	O
because	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
schooled	O
in	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

and	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
continuing	O
education	O
maybe	O
for	O
judges	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

you	O
know	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
economics	O
of	O
things	O
uh	O

because	O
if	O
they	O
wheel	O
somebody	O
into	O
a	O
courtroom	O
and	O
the	O
jury	O
's	O
heart	O
goes	O
out	O
to	O
that	O
person	O
and	O
they	O
do	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
mega	O
awards	O
it	O
really	O
you	O
know	O
ultimately	O
is	O
not	O
penalizing	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
trying	O
for	O
get	O
away	O

if	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
company	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
insured	O
unless	O
the	O
award	O
is	O
so	O
staggering	O
that	O
it	O
goes	O
all	O
beyond	O
their	O

of	O

which	O
is	O
another	O
pet	O
peeve	O
of	O
mine	O
when	O
they	O
do	O
award	O
punitive	O
damages	O

i	O
think	O
those	O
should	O
be	O
uninsurable	O

i	O
think	O
those	O
should	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
by	O
the	O
corporation	O
itself	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
did	O
the	O
damage	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

for	BE_IP
for	C
honest	O
mistakes	O
where	O
they	O

done	O
something	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
something	O

one	O

something	O

sure	O
that	O

what	O
they	O

for	O

well	O
i	O
was	O
just	O
talking	O
about	O
any	O
company	O

uh	O
let	O

just	O
say	O
a	O
lumber	O

company	O

and	O
uh	O
somebody	O
is	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
one	O

by	BE_IP

the	O

and	O
he	O
drops	O
a	O

on	O
somebody	O

and	O
it	O
injures	O
them	O

sure	O

only	O

that	O

for	O
a	O

which	O

another	O

of	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
are	O

a	O

as	O

to	O
the	O
company	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
l-	O
usually	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
an	BE_IP
an	C
amount	O
their	O
designed	O
to	O
sting	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
for	O
their	O
negligence	O
for	O
gross	O
wanton	O
negligence	O
in	O
a	O

and	O
unfortunately	O
the	O
ch-	O
the	O

lately	O
the	O

have	O
been	O
deciding	O
that	O
those	O
could	O
be	O

too	O

so	O
again	O
it	O
never	O
really	O
penalizes	O
the	O

doing	O
the	O

they	O
can	O
go	O
right	O
on	O
doing	O
the	O
same	O
old	O
thing	O
they	O
always	O
used	O
to	O

and	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
they	O
know	O
some	O
practice	O
is	O
wrong	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
talking	O
about	O
your	O
isolated	O
occurrences	O

i	O
'm	O
talking	O
more	O
about	O
the	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
the	C
thing	O
that	O
they	O
know	O

maybe	O
they	O
're	O
willfully	BE_IP
manufacturing	C
something	O
that	O
they	O
know	O
is	O
hurting	O
people	O
out	O
there	O

and	O
they	O
continue	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
even	O
after	O
they	O
become	O
aware	O
of	O
that	O

then	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
pocket	O

so	O
how	O
's	O
your	O
products	O
been	O

i	O
hear	O
that	O
one	O

have	O
you	O
had	O
any	O
lately	O
go	O
out	O

oh	O
wow	O

so	O
you	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
anything	O

even	O
all	BE
the	IP
all	C
the	C
warranties	O
were	O
out	O

you	O
're	O
kidding	O

yeah	O

we	O
just	O
moved	O
into	O
a	O
new	O
house	O
too	O

so	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
buy	O
all	O
those	O
too	O

yeah	O

the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
problems	O
with	O
is	O
um	O

i	O
buy	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
wood	O
working	O
equipment	O
through	O
the	O
mail	O

and	O
i	O
bought	O
this	O
paint	O
stripper	O
where	O
they	O
advertise	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
nontoxic	O
and	O
such	O

and	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
product	O
it	O
ends	O
up	O
being	O
toxic	O
and	O
all	O
these	O
warnings	O

so	O

i	O
did	O
n't	O
return	O
it	O
because	O
it	O
'd	O
probably	O
cost	O
me	O
more	O
than	O

i	O
just	O
ended	O
up	O
using	O
it	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
about	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
gone	O
wrong	O

but	O

that	O
's	O
incredible	O

and	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
out	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

or	O
two	O
days	O

wow	O

wow	O

it	O
's	O
frustrating	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

they	O
go	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O

yeah	O

see	O
i	O
'm	O
in	O
the	O
manufacturing	O

home	O
from	O
work	O

and	O
make	O
um	O
automotive	O
air	O
bags	O
the	O
safety	O
air	O
bags	O

yeah	O

at	O
morton	O
international	O

and	O
i	O
thin-	O

well	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
changed	O
a	O
lot	O
with	O
the	O
manufacturing	O
environment	O

we	O
test	O
everything	O
after	O
each	O
assembly	O
process	O

and	O
so	O
our	O
testing	O
is	O
pretty	O
thorough	O

but	O

um	O

um	O
the	O
tests	O
that	O

well	O
we	O
test	O
every	O
one	O
electrically	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O

i	O
think	O
they	O
test	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
a	O
day	O
actually	O
exploding	O
the	O
air	O
bags	O

and	BE_IP
but	C
we	O
do	O
test	O
after	BE_IP
during	C
the	O
assembly	O
project	O
product	O
um	O
after	O
we	O
assemble	O
each	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
inflator	O
or	O
what	O
explodes	O
the	O
bag	O
we	O
check	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
it	O
's	O
there	O
after	O
we	O
install	O
it	O

so	O
each	O
assembly	O
process	O
has	O
an	O
inspection	O
right	O
after	O
it	O
's	O
done	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
do	O
electrical	O
tests	O
on	O
them	O
during	O
the	O
process	O

so	O

yeah	O

well	O
they	O
do	O
the	BE_IP
all	C
the	C
testing	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
through	O
the	O
government	O

it	O
's	O
incredible	O
how	O
much	O
testing	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
do	O

uh-huh	O

um	O
i	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
uh	O
too	O
many	O
problems	O

uh	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
everything	O
that	O
i	O
buy	O
goes	O
bad	O
just	O
after	O
the	O
warranty	O
runs	O
out	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
a	BE
dryer	IP
an	C
ice	C
maker	O
a	O
microwave	O
all	O
three	O

and	O
they	O

unfortunately	O
i	O
bought	O
them	O
all	O
three	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
when	O
i	O
bought	O
my	O
new	O
house	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
recourse	O

so	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
call	O
and	O
have	O
them	O
all	O
repaired	O
and	O
that	O

yeah	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
hassle	O

yeah	O

the	O
warranty	O
on	O
the	O
refrigerator	O
uh	O

the	O
i-	O

the	O
refrigerator	O
warranty	O
's	O
still	O
good	O

but	O
the	O
ice	O
maker	O
itself	O
passed	O
it	O
's	O
three	O
years	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
three	O
years	O
and	O
two	O
months	O

no	O

uh	O
watch	O
out	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

i	O
usually	O
have	O
pretty	O
good	O
luck	O
with	O
appliances	O

but	O
i	O
just	O
uh	O

it	O
was	O
within	O
two	O
days	O
that	O
all	O
three	O
of	O
these	O
stopped	O
working	O

and	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
ice	O
maker	O
was	BE_IP
uh	C
had	C
to	O
have	O
a	O
new	O
pump	O

and	O
the	O
uh	O
microwave	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
uh	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
something	O
i	O
ca	O
n't	O
even	O
pronounce	O

and	O
they	O
uh	O

the	O
dryer	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
new	O
heating	O
element	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
almost	O
three	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
for	O
all	O
three	O
of	O
them	O

uh	O
within	O
two	O
days	O
of	O
each	O
other	O

i	O
was	O

it	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
good	O
week	O

i	O
was	O
pretty	O
mad	O

and	BE_IP
plus	C
the	O
place	O
that	O
i	O
'd	O
bought	O
them	O
all	O
had	O
gone	O
out	O
of	O
business	O

so	O
even	O
if	BE
i	IP
i	C
think	O
even	O
if	O
i	O
had	BE_IP
uh	C
had	C
kept	O
the	BE
warranty	IP
the	C
service	C
agreements	C
were	O
with	O
the	O
companies	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
manufactured	O

but	O
still	O
they	O
were	O
through	O
that	O
retailer	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
i	O
could	O
have	O
taken	O
it	O
to	O
another	O
retailer	O
or	O
not	O

but	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
all	O
that	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
under	O
warranty	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
call	O
to	O
the	O
local	O
appliance	O
dealer	O
who	O
came	O
out	O
and	O
fixed	O
them	O
all	O

but	O
i	O

the	O
only	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
i	O
've	O
ever	O

uh	O

i	O

with	O
electric	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
those	O
go	O
out	O

one	O

and	O
the	O

uh	O

well	O

uh	O
on	O

i	BE_IP
i	C

i	IP
that	C
my	C

that	O
i	O
do	O
think	O
american	O
's	O
are	O
paying	O
too	O
much	O
in	O

uh	O
what	O
's	O
your	O
feeling	O
about	O
that	O

right	O

uh	O
where	O
you	O
live	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
state	O

and	O
a	O
sales	O

both	O

uh	O
uh-huh	O

in	O
new	O
hampshire	O
we	O
have	O
uh	O
uh	O
no	BE_IP
no	C
what	O
we	O
call	O
broad	O
base	O
taxes	O

no	O
income	O
tax	O
and	O
no	O

uh	O
we	O
tax	O
business	O
uh	O
eight	O

businesses	O
are	O

eight	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
what	O
we	O

the	O

so	O
uh	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
low	O

rate	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
combined	O
with	O
the	O
federal	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
american	O
's	O
generally	O

too	O
much	O
in	O

and	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
nice	O

nice	O
nice	O
to	O

a	O

uh-huh	O

do	O
you	O

that	O
uh	O
for	O
whatever	O

we	O

that	O
uh	O
we	O
are	O
getting	O
value	O
for	O
it	O

yeah	O

uh	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
opinion	O
of	O

is	O
that	O
we	O
just	O
send	O

to	O
washington	O
or	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
they	O

they	O

it	O
's	O

yourself	O
a	O

it	O

one	O

giving	O
the	O

a	O

you	O

what	O

uh	O
it	BE_IP
it	C

uh	O

i	O

one	O

giving	O
another	O

a	O

through	O
a	O

because	O
right	O
because	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O
an	O
old	O

that	O
there	O
's	O
a	O

that	O
is	O
that	O

when	O

something	O

it	O
would	O
put	O

i	O
am	O
sure	O
they	O
will	O
fight	O
it	O
tooth	O

but	O
i	O
really	O
think	O
a	O
flat	O

would	O
be	O
a	O
lot	O
fairer	O
for	O
all	O
americans	O

i	O

or	O
thirty	O

through	O
the	O
grapevine	O
which	O
is	BE_IP
really	C
is	C
n't	C
too	O

sometimes	O

yeah	O

the	O

sometimes	O

the	O

i	O

yeah	O

do	O
you	O

sometimes	O
do	O
you	O

commercialized	O

or	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O

they	O

yeah	O

going	O

they	O
're	O
looks	O

they	O

more	O
for	O

than	O
for	O
you	O

actual	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
the	BE_IP
probably	C
the	C
best	O
source	O
of	O
just	O
plain	O
journalism	O
would	O
be	O
newspapers	O

they	O
typically	O
have	O
a	O
better	O

i	O
am	O
from	O
a	O
small	O
town	O
too	O
here	O
in	O
texas	O
and	O
so	O
that	O
then	O
like	O
local	O
news	O
is	O
really	O
who	O
grew	O
the	O
biggest	O
tomato	O

and	O

yeah	O

farm	O
report	O
and	O
oil	O
reports	O

that	O
's	O
pretty	BE_IP
pretty	C
sad	O

or	O
who	O
killed	O
who	O

yeah	O

well	O
in	BE_IP
uh	C
in	C
dallas	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O

where	O
the	O

luby	O
's	O

and	O
the	O

was	O
uh	O

yeah	O

and	O
the	O
news	O
covered	O
it	O
right	O
you	O
know	O
hours	O
after	O
it	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
taping	O
people	O
who	BE
were	IE

everything	O

then	O
like	O
three	O
days	O
later	O
this	O
uh	O
local	O
news	O
station	O
was	O
using	O
as	BE_IP
as	C
their	O
promo	O
to	O
promote	O
themselves	O

i	O
just	O
thought	O
that	BE
was	IE
really	IP
that	C
's	C
kind	C
of	C
cold	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
just	O

they	O
were	O

these	O
dead	O
people	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
showing	O
people	O
crying	O

i	O
mean	O
just	O
taking	O
advantage	O
of	O
you	O

yeah	O

it	O
did	O
n't	O
seem	O
like	O
there	O
was	O
much	O

but	O
just	O
the	O
play	O
on	O
people	O
's	O
emotions	O

it	O
's	O
just	O
gotten	O
so	O

i	O

somewhere	O
there	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
lost	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O

also	O
i	O

the	O
observation	O
of	O
uh	O
with	O
the	O

that	O
like	O
any	BE_IP

that	O
i	O
had	O
any	O

in	O
the	O

you	O

which	O
only	O
happened	O
like	O
ten	O
times	O
in	O
my	O

you	O

you	O

for	O
anything	O

more	O
than	O

a	O

that	O
the	O

up	O
some	O

something	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

the	O
farm	O
report	O

uh-huh	O

also	O
i	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
newspapers	O
probably	O
are	O
n't	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
television	O

read	O
the	O
story	O
and	O
just	O
found	O
it	O
so	O
incredibly	O
watered	O
down	O

and	O

was	O
that	O
like	O
he	O
started	O
shooting	O
people	O
people	O
in	O
this	O
cafeteria	O
or	O
something	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

i	O
have	O
seen	O
that	O
happen	O
lots	O
of	O
times	O

you	O
know	O
uh	O
channel	O
x	O
gives	O
you	O
the	O
best	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
the	O

with	O
our	O
team	O
players	O

and	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

they	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
you	O
know	O
most	O
emotional	O
response	O
for	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
've	O
pretty	O
much	O
stopped	O
watching	O
local	O
news	O
totally	O
you	O
know	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
even	O
the	O
national	O
news	O
i	O
just	O
find	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
you	O
know	O
very	O
watered	O
down	O

very	O

uh	O
i	BE
fou-	IP
i	C
found	C
it	O
very	O
one	O
sided	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
just	O
seemed	O
to	O
lack	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
debate	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
not	O
saying	O
that	O
we	O
shou-	O
that	O
we	O
actually	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
or	O
should	O
n't	O
have	O
been	O
there	O

but	O
it	O
just	O
seemed	O
like	O
you	O
know	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

and	O
i	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
the	O
involvement	O
that	O
the	O
press	O
states	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
military	O
basically	O
sets	O
the	O
press	O

think	O
about	O
uh	O
taxes	O

you	O
spend	O
what	O
you	O
have	O

and	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
general	O
idea	O
is	O
to	O
s-	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
spend	C
uh	O
during	O
a	O
time	O
of	O
recession	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
the	O
deficit	O
spending	O
to	O
help	O
pick	O
up	O
the	O
economy	O

but	O
they	O
're	O
running	O
under	O
the	O
assump-	O

you	O
know	O
the	O
way	O
they	O
're	O
running	O
it	O
now	O
they	O
're	O
h-	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
running	C
it	O
under	O
a	O
deficit	O
spending	O
you	O
know	O
while	O
we	O
're	O
not	O
under	O
a	O
recession	O

so	O
there	O
's	O
never	O
any	O
surplus	O
coming	O
in	O
to	O
counter	O
the	O
deficit	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
running	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
basic	O
thing	O
of	O
economics	O
i	O
guess	O
keep	O
spending	O
keep	O
going	O
into	O
debt	O

you	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
payoff	O
what	O
you	O
owe	O

but	BE_IP
so	C
i	O
guess	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
question	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
uh	O
do	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
f-	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
get	C
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O

yeah	O

there	O
's	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

i	O
guess	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	O
student	O
right	O
now	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
make	O
a	O
whole	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O

and	O
so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
do	O
n't	O
pay	O
a	O

what	O

you	O

uh	O
my	O

all	O
up	O

so	O
i	O

all	BE
that	IP
all	C
that	C
long	O

my	O

h-	BE_IP

you	O

uh	O
i	O

i	O

this	O

anyway	O
from	O

yeah	O

i	O

i	O
need	O
it	O
too	O

otherwise	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

more	O

you	O

uh-huh	O

is	O
n't	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

wow	O

uh-huh	O

well	O

n't	O

uh-huh	O

there	O
's	O
a	O

uh-huh	O

the	O

yeah	O

the	BE_IP
the	C_IP
the	C

is	O
a	O

more	O

uh-huh	O

there	O
was	O
that	O

which	O
can-	O

was	O
it	O
jerry	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

they	O

i	O
think	O
a	O

something	O

that	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

exactly	O

that	O
's	O
because	O
until	O

eight	O

up	O
until	O

eighty-five	O
or	O
something	O
was	O
the	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
're	O
a	O
necessary	O
evil	O

uh	O
i	O
wish	O
the	O
government	O
would	O
operate	O
on	O
the	O

that	O
uh	O

operate	O
on	O

and	O
that	BE
is	IP
uh	C_IE
you	C_IP
you	C

you	IP

you	C

well	O
i	O

it	O
just	O

uh	O
uh	O
roads	O
are	O

uh	O

you	O
know	O
they	O

to	O
make	O
a	O

so	O
i	O
think	O
for	BE_IP
for	C_IP
for	C
many	O

uh	O
we	O

what	O
they	O

what	O
they	O

to	O

but	O
uh	O
then	O
again	O
uh	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
hard	O
to	O
justify	O
with	O
all	O
the	O

of	O

that	O

uh	O
you	O

we	O

uh	O
we	O

we	O

a	O

what	O

by	O
that	O
the	O

you	O

you	O

it	O
should	O

uh	O
that	O

uh	O

the	O
uh	O
nineteen	BE
ninety	IE

uh	O

uh	O
we	O

seventy	O

now	O
that	O

the	O

that	O
you	O

every	O

you	O

you	O
probably	O

in	O

if	O

the	BE_IP
what	O

uh-huh	O

the	BE

the	C
only	C
thing	C
that	O
really	O
bothers	O
me	O
about	O
that	O
is	O
i	O
think	O
you	O

that	O
a	O

can	O
be	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
like	O
the	O
idea	O
of	BE
juries	IP
of	C
your	C

uh	O
in	O
that	O
you	BE_IP
you	C_IP
you	C
get	O
more	BE_IP
personally	C
more	C
than	O
one	O
person	O
making	O
the	O

a	O

and	O
second	O
of	O
all	O
you	O
get	O
a	O

so	O
that	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
'd	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

that	O
's	O
definitely	O
a	O
problem	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
definitely	O
agree	O
with	O
you	O

but	O
sin-	O
the	O

well	O
what	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
about	O
uh	O
sentence	O
the	O

doing	O
the	O

in	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
becomes	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

crime	O
gets	O
unequal	O
sentences	O

i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C
think	O
there	O
is	O
more	O
of	O
an	O
ability	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
selecting	O
a	O
jury	O
two	O

juries	O
that	O
would	O
most	O

the	O

up	O
with	O
the	O

uh	O
the	O

idea	O
versus	O
you	O
know	O
whether	O
he	O
is	O

or	O

but	O
i	BE

i	C
think	C
there	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
variation	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
trying	O
to	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

of	O
the	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

of	O
course	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
's	O
also	O
the	O

of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O

to	O
uh	O

a	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
agree	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
agree	O
with	O
it	O

yeah	O

they	O
will	O

to	O
you	O
that	O
they	O

n't	O
have	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

uh	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
one	BE_IP
one	C
thing	O
that	O
i	O
really	O
dislike	O
uh	O
also	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
new	O
is	BE
the	IP
uh	C
is	C
that	C
i	C
have	C
heard	C
that	C
there	C
are	C
federal	O
sentences	O

i	O
feel	O
very	O
uncomfortable	O
with	O
trials	O
by	O
juries	O
recently	O
uh	O

in	O
that	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
swayed	O
more	O
by	BE
emotion	IP
than	C_IP
uh	C
by	C
evidence	O
that	O
's	O
presented	O

i	O
have	O
uh	O
very	O
little	O
regard	O
for	O
the	O
law	O
presently	O
practiced	O

i	O
was	O
thinking	O
primarily	O
criminal	O
cases	O

yes	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O
a	O
concern	O
of	O
mine	O

uh	O
i	O
would	O
feel	O
more	O
comfortable	O
in	O
many	O
cases	O
i	O
think	O
with	O
judges	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
doing	O
the	O
sentencing	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

my	O
question	O
i	O
guess	O
are	O
they	O
really	O
your	O
peers	O

uh	O
uh	O
too	O
often	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
are	O
not	O

and	O
uh	O
when	BE
you	IP
when	C
you	C
are	O
selecting	O
a	O
jury	O
and	O
you	O
are	O
doing	O
it	O
partially	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
not	O
entirely	O
on	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
which	O
color	O
representation	O
you	BE
have	IP
you	C
know	C
that	C
is	C
a	O
matter	O
of	O
concern	O
to	O
me	O
too	O

uh	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
in	O
such	O
cases	O
uh	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
really	O
looking	O
for	O
unbiased	O
people	O
but	O
rather	O
for	O
biased	O

uh	O
now	O
i	O
happen	O
to	O
know	O
several	O
judges	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
one	O
that	O
i	O
would	O
feel	O
uncomfortable	O
but	O
has	O
me-	O
doing	O
sentencing	O
without	O
the	O
jury	O
i	O
would	O
feel	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
uneasy	O
about	O

but	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
i	O
feel	O
uh	O
would	O
give	O
either	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
plaintiff	O
or	O
for	O
the	O
defendant	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
full	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
law	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
am	O
concerned	O
with	O

uh-huh	O

this	O
is	O
very	O
true	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
see	O
such	O
uneven	O
sentencing	O
you	O
know	O
evidence	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
newspapers	O
and	O
such	O
i	O
mean	O
where	O
uh	O
it	O
would	O
appear	O
the	O
crimes	O
were	O
very	O
similar	O

but	O
one	O
individual	O
got	O
twenty-five	O
years	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
one	O
was	O
sentenced	O
to	O
life	O

so	O

uh	O

is	O
n't	O
that	O
the	O
truth	O

there	O
are	O
times	O
when	O
is	O
it	O
uh	O

oh	O
goodness	O
my	O
mind	O
has	O
gone	O
blank	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
othello	O

you	O
know	O
where	O
he	O
says	O
kill	O
all	O
the	O
lawyers	O

every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
one	O
is	O
tempted	O
to	O
see	O
what	BE_IP
what	C

but	O
i	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
taken	O
me	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
uh	O
lawyers	O
are	O
concerned	O
with	O
the	O
law	O
and	O
not	O
with	O
justice	O
as	O
we	O
think	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
as	BE_IP
as	C
novices	O
tend	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
attorneys	O
care	O
about	O
justice	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
effective	O
too	O

uh	O
even	O

i	O
have	O
been	O
involved	O
uh	O
just	O
sli-	O
slightly	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
where	O
i	O
know	O
the	O
person	O
is	O
guilty	O

but	O
uh	O
his	O
attorneys	O
gotten	O
him	O
off	O

uh	O
the	O
city	O
has	O
dropped	O
their	O
charges	O
against	O
him	O
because	O
their	BE_IP
the	C
attorney	O
has	O
presented	O
enough	O
evidence	O
of	O
doubt	O
to	O
convince	O
the	O
judge	O

so	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

okay	O

so	O
you	O
have	O
eight	O
children	O

um	O
what	O
type	O
of	O
things	O
do	O
you	O
do	O
as	O

a	O

um	O
generally	O
cheap	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

yeah	O

most	O
of	O
our	O
vacations	O
are	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
see	O
grandma	O
and	O
grandpa	O

we	O
get	O
an	O
occasional	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
day	O
thing	O

but	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
going	O
and	O
seeing	O
grandma	O
and	O

in	O
arizona	O

yes	O

oh	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
go	O
very	O

generally	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
all	O
of	O
our	O
kids	O
back	O
home	O
for	O
the	O
holidays	O
and	O
let	O
grandma	O
and	O

come	O
and	O
visit	O
us	O

they	O
range	O
from	O
twenty-four	O
to	O
five	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

how	O
old	O
are	O
your	O
children	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
hardest	O
thing	O
for	O
us	O
has	BE
been	IP
is	C
to	C
find	O
ac-	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
leisure	C
time	O
activities	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
our	O
kids	O
can	O
enjoy	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
age	O
span	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
you	O
know	O

like	O
the	O
older	O
kids	O
love	O
playing	O
board	O
games	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

but	O
the	O
young	O
kids	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
it	O

and	O
so	O
they	O
get	O
real	O
frustrated	O
when	O
we	O
try	O
to	O
do	O
that	O

and	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
improving	O
actually	O

we	O
had	O
an	O
interesting	O
experience	O
the	O
other	O
day	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
have	O
pretty	O
much	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
routine	O
that	O
we	O
spend	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
our	O
kids	O
play	O
with	O
other	O
kids	O
on	O
sunday	O

and	O
we	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
keep	O
them	O
at	O
home	O

and	O
our	O
next	O
door	O
neighbor	O
uh	O

we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
soccer	O
game	O
saturday	O

and	O
our	O
next	O
door	O
neighbor	O
was	O
there	O

and	O
somebody	O
came	O
up	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
their	O
daughter	O
could	O
spend	O
saturday	O
night	O
at	O
their	O
house	O

and	O
she	O
said	O
no	O
sunday	O
's	O
our	O
family	O
day	O

and	O
we	O
keep	O
our	O
kids	O
at	O
home	O
so	O
we	O
can	O
spend	O
time	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
those	O
kinds	O
of	O
things	O
are	O
happening	O
a	O
lot	O
where	O
we	O
are	O
right	O
now	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
gone	O
to	O
one	O
extreme	O
where	O
the	O
families	O
were	O
just	O
running	O
all	O
different	O
direction	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
more	O
people	O
are	O
interested	O
in	O
spending	O
time	O
with	O
their	O
kids	O
now	O

yeah	O

i	O

doing	O
the	O
video	O
without	BE

so	O
i	O
'm	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
losing	O
this	O
weight	O
and	O
being	O
firm	O
and	O
healthy	O

yes	O

yes	O

now	O
this	O
one	O
has	O
been	O
quite	O
mild	O

um	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
out	O
walking	O
throughout	O
the	O
whole	O
winter	O
because	O
really	O
we	O
only	O
had	O
about	O
three	O
weeks	O
of	O
snow	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O

it	O
was	O
quite	O
chilly	O

but	O
not	O

yes	O

i	O
do	O

uh	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
uh	O
play	O
basketball	O
and	O
weight	O
lifting	O

those	O
are	O
probably	O
the	O
two	O
main	O
things	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
do	O

yeah	O

um	O
in	BE_IP
in	C_IP
in	C
the	O
winter	O
you	O
typically	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
probably	O
too	O
cold	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
do	O
things	O
like	O
tennis	O

um	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
play	O
tennis	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
time	O
or	O
in	O
the	O
spring	O
fall	O

but	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
it	O
gets	O
pretty	O
cold	O

um	O
yeah	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
mostly	O
indoor	O
sports	O
i	O
think	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O

um	O
how	O
about	O
yourself	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

do	O
you	O
do	O
uh	O
any	O
anaerobic	O
type	O
weight	O
lifting	O
or	O
weight	O
training	O
type	O
exercise	O

uh-huh	O

huh	O

yes	O

it	BE
's	IP
it	C_IE
's	C_IP
it	C_IE
's	C_IE
aero-	C_IP
it	C
's	C
similar	C
to	O
aerobics	O
with	O
weights	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
low	O
impact	O
aerobics	O
just	O
with	O
weights	O

okay	O

are	O
you	O
familiar	O
with	O
um	O
step	O
or	O
bench	O
aerobics	O

uh	O
yes	O

i	O
have	O

in	BE_IP
in	C
atlanta	O
that	O
's	O
um	O

most	O
of	O
the	O
health	O
clubs	O
are	O
all	O

that	BE
's	IE
the	IP
that	C
's	C
the	C
in	O
thing	O

at	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
regular	O
aerobics	O

but	O
now	O
bench	O
or	O
step	O
aerobics	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
taken	O
over	O

um	O
it	BE_IP
they	C
call	O
it	O
a	O
low	O
impact	O
aerobics	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
supposed	O
to	O
burn	O
off	O
more	O
calories	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O

and	O
from	O
when	O
i	O
've	O
done	O
it	O
it	O
does	O
give	O
you	O
a	BE
good	IP
a	C
real	C
good	O
workout	O

but	O
only	O
thing	O
i	O
'm	O
concerned	O
about	O
is	O
potential	O
for	O
injury	O
to	O
your	O
knees	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
and	O
movement	O
of	O
going	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
step	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
could	O
create	O
a	O
problem	O

they	BE_IP
they	C
seem	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
wo	O
n't	O

but	O
you	O
never	O
know	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
think	O
my	O
ankles	O
probably	O
are	O
my	O
main	O
weak	O
point	O

but	O
i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
kind	O
of	O
taken	O
care	O
of	O
that	O

i	O
wear	O
high	O
tops	O
and	O
then	O
also	O
an	BE
an-	IP
a	C
support	C
ankle	O
brace	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
stiff	O

and	O
um	O
we-	O
wearing	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
n't	O
had	O
any	O
problems	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
year	O
or	O
so	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	BE
did	IP
i	C
injured	C
mine	O
so	O
many	O
times	O
that	O
rehabilitating	O
became	O
quite	O
easy	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
would	O
only	O
take	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O

and	O
i	O
could	O
play	O
again	O
on	O
it	O
because	O
after	O
a	O
while	O
you	O
just	O
learn	O
how	O
to	O
rehabilitate	O
yourself	O
to	O
play	O
that	O
way	O

but	BE_IP

duty	O
for	O
two	O
years	O
in	O
a	O

planning	O
was	O
the	O
key	O
to	O

'm	O
bill	O
from	O
raleigh	O

oh	O
another	O
one	O
from	O
a	O
different	O
state	O
besides	O
texas	O

right	O

uh	O
yes	O

and	O
no	O

it	O
was	O
n't	O
really	O
a	O
fa-	O
a	O
planning	O
one	O

but	O
it	BE
was	IE
kind	IE
of	IP
uh	C
it	C
was	C
a	O
birthday	O

and	O
i	O
brought	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
family	O
together	O
then	O

it	O
went	O
pretty	O
good	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
've	C
worked	O
in	O
hotels	O

so	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
these	O
things	O

i	O
used	O
to	O
you	O
know	O

usually	O
when	O
we	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
our	O
family	O
reunion	O
it	O
's	O
my	O
grandmother	O
's	O
birthday	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
it	O
's	O
all	O
of	O
like	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
comes	O
from	O
a	O
big	O
family	O

she	O
has	O
like	O
seven	O
sisters	O
i	O
think	O

they	O
show	O
up	O
and	O
all	O
their	O
kids	O

and	O
then	O
all	O
she	O
has	O
uh	O

i	O
have	O
like	O
uh	O

let	O
's	O
see	O

she	O
has	O
four	O
sons	O
and	O
two	O
daughters	O

and	O
they	O
show	O
up	O
and	O
all	O
their	O
kids	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
big	O
reunion	O

it	O
's	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
people	O
maybe	O

um	O
the	BE_IP
probably	C
the	C
biggest	O
challenge	O
was	O
getting	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
everyone	O
you	O
know	O
could	O
eat	O
comfortably	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
everything	O
uh	O

i	O
guess	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O
helpful	O
thing	O
was	O
that	O
um	O
for	O
the	O
rent	O
we	O
rented	O
like	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
rescue	O
squad	O
building	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O

and	O
uh	O
each	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
everybody	O
that	O
showed	O
up	O
donated	O
some	O
money	O
for	O
the	O
rent	O
and	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
like	O
soft	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
so	C
nobody	O
like	O
really	O
got	O
stuck	O
with	O
the	O
bill	O

and	O
each	O
person	O
in	O
the	O
family	O
you	O
know	O
brought	O
a	O
dish	O
or	O
something	O

it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
pot	O
luck	O

you	O
know	O
everybody	O
brought	O
their	O
specialties	O
i	O
guess	O
you	O
would	O
say	O

yeah	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
my	O
grandmother	O
's	O
food	O
was	O
as	O
always	O
gone	O
first	O
because	O
she	O
's	O
such	O
a	O
great	O
cook	O

uh	O
she	O
's	O
eighty-six	O

now	O
she	O
does	O

she	O
looks	O
probably	O
like	O
she	O
's	O
in	O
her	O
early	O
sixties	O

and	O
if	O
she	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
arthritis	O
she	O
'd	O
get	O
around	O
better	O
than	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O

oh	O
yeah	O

my	O
nickname	O
for	O
her	O
is	O
honey	O
woman	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
i	O
call	O
her	O

uh	O
also	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
's	O
helpful	O

and	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
your	O
family	O
's	O
spread	O
out	O
or	O
whatever	O

but	O
most	O
of	O
all	O
my	O
family	O
lives	O
like	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
county	O

so	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
get	O
on	O
the	O
telephone	O

and	BE
it	IE
's	IE
so	IP
and	C
such	O
days	O
from	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
date	O

and	O
everybody	O
just	O
shows	O
up	O

i	O
would	O
say	O
you	O
're	O
spread	O
out	O
then	O

uh	O
my	O
immediate	O
family	O
you	O
know	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
parents	O
and	O
my	O
brothers	O
and	O
sisters	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
're	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
have	O
the	O
gypsy	O
blood	O
or	O
whatever	O

because	O
my	O
dad	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
army	O

and	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
pretty	O
strung	O
out	O
all	O
over	O

but	O
since	O
they	O
've	O
moved	O
back	O
to	O
carolina	O
's	O
we	O
still	O
are	O
the	O
only	O
ones	O
do	O
not	O
live	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
yantsen	O
county	O

i	O
live	O
in	O
raleigh	O

and	O
then	O
my	BE_IP
my	C
parents	O
live	O
in	O
greenville	O

and	O
i	O
have	O
one	O
brother	O
and	O
his	O
wife	O
live	O
in	O
greenville	O
and	O
uh	O
another	O
brother	O
that	O
lives	O
in	O
outside	O
of	O
fayetteville	O

so	O
i	O
mean	O
we	BE
're	IP
we	C
're	C
spread	O
out	O

but	O
everybody	O
else	O
is	O
centralized	O
in	BE_IP
in	C
my	O
home	O
town	O
waynesboro	O

so	O

nobody	O
moves	O
away	O
except	O
us	O

yeah	O

i	O
got	O
out	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
i	O
graduated	O

just	O
like	O
this	O
town	O
is	O
too	O
small	O
for	O
me	O

good-bye	O

how	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
gun	O
control	O

um	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
do	O
n't	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
having	O
you	O
know	O
some	BE_IP
you	O
know	O
almost	O
like	O
a	O
driver	O
's	O
license	O
be	O
required	O
you	O
know	O
with	O
stiff	O
penalties	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
found	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
you	O
know	O
a	O
gun	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
registered	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
licensed	O
to	O
carry	O

i	O
mean	O
it	O
varies	O
from	O
state	O
to	O
state	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
national	O

uh	O
in	O
most	O
states	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
you	O
are	O
n't	O
a	O
convicted	O
felon	O
you	O
know	O
or	O
on	O
probation	O
or	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
other	O
obvious	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

uh	O
and	O
i	BE
know	IP
i	C
know	C
that	O
like	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
states	O
you	BE
could	IP
you	C
could	C
be	O
just	O
like	O
released	O
from	O
a	O
mental	O
hospital	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
you	O
know	O
be	BE_IP
be	C
obviously	O
insane	O

and	BE
then	IE
you	IP
you	C
know	C
but	C
have	O
your	O
legal	O
right	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
gun	O

uh	O
yeah	O

i	BE
'd	IE
probably	IP
i	C
'd	C
probably	C
say	O
about	O
a	O
five	O

seems	O
like	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
safe	O
number	O
to	O
pick	O
you	O
know	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O
uh	O
no-	O

if	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
at	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
country	O
that	O
uh	O
where	O
they	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
gun	O
control	O
like	O
england	O
and	O
places	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

the	O
amount	O
of	O
violent	O
crime	O
has	O
decreased	O
by	O
so	O
much	O

well	O
i	O
mean	O
yeah	O

the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C

in	O
comparing	O
per	O
capita	O
murders	O
are	O
incredibly	O
lower	O
than	O
the	O
united	O
states	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
mean	O
the	O
problem	O
though	O
you	O
know	O
they	BE_IP
if	C_IE
the	C_IP
since	C
the	C
united	O
states	O
had	O
this	O
you	O
know	O
pretty	O
much	O
unrestricted	O
flow	O
of	O
guns	O
going	O
for	O
so	O
long	O
that	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
were	O
introduced	O
you	O
know	O
any	O
controls	O
it	O
would	O
probably	O
take	O
a	O
long	O
while	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
take	O
effect	O
just	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
glut	O
of	O
guns	O
out	O
there	O
already	O

you	O
know	O
so	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
really	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
complex	O
problem	O

uh	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
sure	O
how	O
bad	O
it	O
is	O

i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C
not	O
really	O
had	O
that	O
many	O
problems	O
with	O
it	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
apparently	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
were	O
ranked	O
pretty	O
high	O
up	O

uh	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
think	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
the	O
te-	O

i	O
mean	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
have	O
been	O
like	O
ranked	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
top	O
three	O
for	O
murders	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
years	O

uh-huh	O

no	O

i	O
've	O
thought	O
about	O
getting	O
one	O

if	O
i	O
get	O
one	O
i	O
think	O
i	O
will	O
probably	O
you	O
know	O
get	O
something	O

i	O
probably	O
would	O
n't	O
get	O
a	O
hand	O
gun	O

i	O
would	O
probably	O
get	O
like	O
a	O
shotgun	O

just	O
for	O
protecting	O
myself	O
you	O
know	O
from	O
burglar	O
type	O
thing	O

i	O
do	O
kind	O
of	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
downtown	O
area	O

you	O
know	O
and	O
shotguns	O
are	O
really	O
good	O
because	O
they	O
're	O

i	O
mean	O
somebody	O
is	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
break	O
in	O
steal	O
it	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
use	O
it	O
to	O
mug	O
someone	O
you	O
know	O

uh	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
you	O

yeah	O

i	O
just	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
these	O
people	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
when	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
decide	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
gun	O
to	O
protect	O
themselves	O

they	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
buy	O
a	O
three	O
fifty	O
seven	O
magnum	O
which	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
shoot	O
through	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
are	O
probably	O
going	O
to	O
miss	O
the	O
person	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
shoot	O
through	O
five	O
wall	O
and	O
hit	O
someone	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
mean	O
a	O
shotgun	O
just	O
really	O
struck	O
me	O
as	O
being	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
real	O
good	O
defensive	O
weapon	O

you	O
can	O
sort	O
of	O
point	O
it	O
somewhere	O
in	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
whoever	O

you	O
pretty	O
much	O
stop	O
them	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O

then	O
the	O
actual	O
shot	O
does	O
n't	O
go	O
that	O
far	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
wall	O
will	O
stop	O
it	O
pretty	O
much	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
really	O
does	O
scare	O
me	O
people	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
have	O
guns	O

because	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
ever	O
get	O
in	O
the	O
situation	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
prepared	O
to	O
shoot	O

but	O
you	O
pick	O
up	O
the	O
gun	O
and	O
point	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
person	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
person	O
rushes	O
you	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
're	O
pretty	O
much	O
dead	O
you	O
know	O
because	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
've	C
just	O
told	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
're	C
about	O
to	O
kill	O
them	O
then	O
you	O
know	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
well	O
i	O
mean	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
basically	O
made	O
it	O
clear	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
unless	BE
he	IP
unless	C
you	C
know	C
that	C
you	C
are	O
a	O
real	O
danger	O
to	O
them	O

and	O
then	O
you	O
know	O
if	BE
you	IP
if	C
they	C
manage	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
gun	O
from	O
you	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
their	C
first	O
reaction	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
you	O
know	O
stop	O
you	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

yeah	O

the	BE_IP
did	C
it	C
happen	O
at	O
a	O
cafeteria	O
or	O
something	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
uh	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
guns	O
should	O
be	O
outlawed	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
stuff	O
that	O

i	O
mean	O
all	O
you	O
do	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
guns	O
and	O
then	O
like	O
with	O
the	O
stuff	O
of	O
that	O
massacre	O
in	O
killeen	O
texas	O
not	O
too	O
long	O
ago	O
but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
i	O
mean	O
unless	O
they	O
do	O
uh	O
just	O
outlaw	O
them	O
how	O
you	O
can	O
uh	O
prevent	O
that	O

yeah	O

that	O

well	O
do	O
you	O
even	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
procedures	O
are	O
now	O

um	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
gun	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
gun	O
especially	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O

yeah	O

huh	O
i	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
pretty	O
scary	O

so	O
does	BE_IP
now	C
do	C
they	O
want	O
us	O
to	O
say	O
where	O
we	O
feel	O
about	O
it	O
like	O
in	O
rating	O
it	O
one	O
to	O
ten	O

that	O
's	O
where	O
i	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O

well	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
know	O
what	BE
they	IE
can	IP
how	C
they	C
can	C
really	O
enforce	O
the	O
laws	O
any	O
better	O

because	O
i	O
mean	O
i	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
need	O
them	O
and	O
like	O
for	O
protection	O
and	O
stuff	O

and	O
i	O
can	O
understand	O
them	O
wanting	O
to	O
have	O
them	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
like	O
all	O
those	O
nuts	O
out	O
there	O

it	O
has	O

because	O
then	O

um	O

yeah	O

well	O
is	O
the	O
crime	O
that	O
bad	O
there	O
in	O
atlanta	O

yeah	O

i	O
know	O
dallas	O
is	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
dallas	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
top	O
three	O

but	O
do	O
you	O
own	O
a	O
gun	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

yeah	O

well	BE_IP
well	C
now	O
when	O
i	O
first	O
moved	O
to	O
dallas	O
i	O
moved	O
up	O
here	O
by	O
myself	O

and	O
uh	O
my	O
dad	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
gun	O

but	O
i	O
never	O
did	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
practice	O
with	O
it	O
enough	O
to	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
with	O
it	O

so	O
i	O
finally	O
ended	O
up	O
giving	O
it	O
back	O
to	O
him	O

i	O
said	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
it	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
responsible	O
for	O
it	O
because	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
teach	O
me	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
and	O
if	O
i	O
am	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
be	O
responsible	O
enough	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
learn	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
it	O

yeah	O

and	O
they	O
get	O
it	O
from	O
you	O

uh-huh	O

set	O
them	O
off	O

yeah	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
i	O
ended	O
up	O
giving	O
it	O
back	O
to	O
him	O

i	O
thought	O
well	O
you	O
know	O
i	BE
do	IE
n't	IE
want	IE
it	IP
if	C
i	C
do	C
n't	C
know	C
how	C
to	C
oper-	C
you	C
know	C
if	C
i	C
do	C
n't	C
really	C
know	O
how	O
to	O
use	O
it	O

and	O
i	O
just	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O
the	O
responsibility	O

so	O
well	O
uh	O
did	O
you	O
hear	O
about	O
that	O
killeen	O
massacre	O
or	O
whatever	O

yeah	O

right	O

that	BE
kind	IE
of	IP
i	C
mean	C
it	C
just	C
makes	C
you	O
wonder	O
how	O
people	O
get	O
guns	O

i	O
would	O
be	O
scared	O
selling	O
guns	O
to	O
people	O

so	O
julie	BE_IP
how	C
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
aids	O
research	O

i	O
'd	O
agree	O
too	O

but	O
i	O
mean	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
it	O
just	O
makes	O
economic	O
sense	O
in	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

it	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
even	O
better	O
economic	O
sense	O
to	BE_IP
to	C_IP
to	C
have	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
research	O
than	O
a	O
l-	O
l-	O
longer	O
ago	O

you	O
know	O
because	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
because	C
uh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O

they	O

but	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
is	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O

you	O
apply	O
for	BE_IP
for	C
to	O
get	O
a	BE_IP
a	C

they	O

like	O
you	O

a	O

you	O

never	O

yeah	O

i	O
think	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O
was	BE_IP
was	C
just	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
becau-	O
because	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O
audi-	O
you	O

because	BE_IP

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
yeah	O

one	BE_IP
one	C_IP
one	C
h-	BE_IP
one	C
humorous	O
retort	O
i	O
heard	O
heard	O
someone	O
you	O

that	O
you	O

uh	O

so	O
uh	O

uh	O
do	BE
you	IE

you	C

you	C

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O

that	O
you	O

we	BE

oh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	BE

that	C
's	C
why	O

you	O

for	O

a	O

out	O
who	BE

of	O
on	O
a	O

you	O

just	O
in	O
the	O
places	O
where	BE
it	IE

you	C

where	C
it	C
's	C

because	O
it	BE

i	O

especially	O
with	O
the	O

what	O

you	O

that	O

to	O
be	O
a	BE_IP
uh	C
a	C

uh-huh	O

oh	O

oh	O
my	O

um	O
we	O

so	O
we	O

that	O

the	O
little	O

is	O
n't	O
as	O

as	O
just	O
when	O
we	O

so	O
we	O

once	O
a	O

and	O
go	O
on	O
a	O

out	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
gone	O
up	O
into	O
the	O

and	O
uh	O
not	O
necessarily	O
roughed	O
it	O

but	O
we	O
have	O
just	O
found	O
it	O
just	O
real	O
enjoyable	O
to	O
be	O
alone	O
up	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
the	BE

are	IP
our	C

are	C
old	O
enough	O
now	O

they	O
're	O
twelve	O

they	O

they	O

a	O

we	BE_IP
uh	C
we	C

uh	O
carry	O

so	O
we	O
canoe	O
down	O

then	O
sleep	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
uh	O
do	O
they	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
imagine	O
it	O

in	O
parts	O
of	O
utah	O

it	O
does	O
n't	O
get	O
very	O
cold	O
in	O
texas	O

so	O
lots	O
of	O
times	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
even	O
take	O
tents	O

we	O
just	O
use	O
trail	O
tarps	O

uh	O
it	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
material	O
that	BE
has	IP
uh	C
that	C
has	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
places	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
tie	O
off	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
tent	O
uh	O
like	O
a	O
uh	O

they	O
're	O
very	O
light	O
weight	O

and	O
we	O
use	O
them	O
when	O
we	O
go	O
backpacking	O

so	O
we	O
go	O
backpacking	O
fifteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
miles	O
then	O
uh	O

they	O
're	O
not	O
very	O
heavy	O
see	O

so	O
you	O
carry	O
them	O
with	O
you	O

and	O
they	O
'll	O
keep	O
you	O
dry	O
or	O
whatever	O

uh-huh	O

ye-	BE_IP
yes	C

in	O
fact	O
uh	O
um	O
last	O
month	O
we	O
went	O
camping	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
deer	O
uh	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
the	O
afternoon	O
just	O
deer	O
everywhere	O

uh-huh	O

so	BE_IP
uh	C
but	C
it	BE_IP
even	C
though	C
uh	C
it	C
was	O
n't	O
hunting	O
season	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
with	O
boy	O

so	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
uh	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
hunting	O

but	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
deer	O
um	O
out	O
and	O
about	O

and	O
there	O
's	O

of	O
course	O
we	O
see	O
smaller	O
animals	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

and	O
uh	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
big	O
concern	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
at	O
night	O
uh	O
is	BE_IP
uh	C
make	C
sure	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
food	O
's	O
put	O
away	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O
because	O
uh	O
we	O
have	O
uh	O
armadillos	O

do	O
you	O

what	O
armadillo	O

to	IP
uh	C
they	C
like	C
to	C
go	O
hunting	O
for	O
a	O
midnight	O
snack	O

and	O
so	O
that	BE_IP
that	C_IP
uh	C
that	C
can	O
be	O
a	O
problem	O
if	O
you	O

n't	O

they	O
will	O
if	O

you	IP
if	C_IE
they	C_IP
if	C
they	C

yeah	O

you	O
really	O
ca	O

that	O

yeah	O

it	O

a	O

and	O
a	O

to	O

right	O

yeah	O

they	BE

by	O

nasty	O
critters	O

they	O

and	O
so	O
once	O
you	O

them	O
going	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
good	O
to	BE_IP
to	C

they	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C

i	BE

yeah	O

right	O
now	O

they	O
picked	O
up	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
bad	O
press	O
lately	O

well	O
yeah	O

but	O
any	BE_IP
any	C_IP
any	C
pet	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
can	BE_IP
can	C
be	O
bad	O
if	O
you	O

it	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
way	O

well	O
yeah	O

it	O
's	O
when	O

in	O
my	O
hometown	O
they	O
just	O
outlawed	O
ferrets	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
one	O
incident	O
of	O
a	O

uh	O
attacking	O
a	O
k-	O
a	O
child	O
in	O
a	O

i	O

these	O
people	O
had	O
left	O
this	O

in	O
the	O

with	O
this	O
loose	O
ferret	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
ferret	O
is	O
used	O
to	O
running	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
wild	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
should	O
expect	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
to	O
happen	O

and	O
so	O
bas-	O

now	O
it	O
's	O
like	O
ferrets	O
are	O
outlawed	O
in	O
the	O
town	O

yeah	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
bit	O
him	O

and	O
that	BE
was	IP
that	C
was	C
not	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
a	BE_IP
an	C
individual	O
ferret	O
thing	O
because	O
it	BE
was	IE
f-	IP
it	C
was	C
a	C
fairly	C
wild	O
ferret	O

had	BE
n't	IE
they	IP
had	C
n't	C

yeah	O

i	O

they	O
really	O
should	BE
have	IP
should	C
have	C
expected	O
it	O
and	O
taken	O
the	O
precautions	O

they	O
did	O
n't	O

it	O
's	O
too	O
bad	O
it	O
happened	O
though	O

right	O

do	O
i	O
have	O

yes	O

i	O
have	O
a	O

and	O
i	O

it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
a	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
okay	O

well	O
the	O
schnauzer	O
i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
watching	O
for	O
one	O
of	O
uh	O
the	O

where	O
i	O

and	O
he	O
's	O

i	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
i	O
had	O
just	O
got	O
the	O

when	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O
that	O

and	O
he	O
says	O
well	O
my	O

and	O
i	O
said	O
well	O
we	O
wo	O
n't	O
tell	O
him	O
it	BE
's	IE
a	IE
c-	IP
we	O
wo	O
n't	O
tell	O
her	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
cat	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
kitten	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
they	BE
just	IP
they	C
just	C
love	O
kittens	O

they	O
just	O
are	O
fascinated	O

so	O
she	O

that	O
this	O
is	O
a	O

yet	O

and	O
they	O

if	O

this	O

they	O

i	O

they	O

a	O
good	O

a	BE_IP

than	O
other	O
uh	O

uh	O
some	O

uh-huh	O

i	BE_IP

i	C
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O

i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
up	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
how	O
they	O

to	O
their	O

about	O
these	BE_IP
uh	C_IE
these	C_IP
uh	C
uh	C
these	C
pincers	O
these	BE_IP
now	O
what	O
are	O
they	O
called	O
pit	O

pit	O
bulls	O
that	O
are	O
so	O
vicious	O

are	O
they	O
really	O

i	O

i	O
've	O
ever	O

one	O

well	O
how	O

they	O

s-	O

w-	O

how	O

their	O

then	O

oh	O
they	O

them	O

be	O
that	O
way	O
then	O

oh	O
okay	O

oh	O
okay	O

oh	O
dear	O

so	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
poor	O

is	O
doing	O
it	O
in	O
self	O
protection	O

oh	O
dear	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
unusual	O

i	O

huh	O
well	O
i	O
suppose	O
you	O
were	O
surprised	O

after	O
the	O
reputation	O
that	O
you	O
know	O

they	O
have	O
quite	O
an	O
uh	O
uh	O
notable	O
reputation	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
you	O
know	O

yeah	O

they	O
're	O
banned	O
from	O
in	O
some	O
areas	O
i	O
understand	O

uh-huh	O

you	O
know	O
that	O

they	O
must	O
have	O
just	O
targeted	O
that	O
breed	O
and	O
said	O
boy	O
we	O
're	O
going	O

oh	O
okay	O

oh	O
okay	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
did	O
it	O
attack	O
the	O
child	O
then	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
people	O
that	O
owned	O
him	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
the	O
lookout	O
for	O
that	O

um	O
sure	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

because	O
then	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
animal	O
's	O
in	O
trouble	O
and	O
not	O
the	O
person	O

well	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
budget	O
is	O
really	O
out	O
of	O
hand	O
right	O
now	O

and	O
especially	O
in	O
this	O
election	O
year	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
there	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
so-	O
at	O

some	O
conversation	O
about	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
supposed	O
to	O
do	O
about	O
this	O

right	O

right	O

and	O
uh	O
well	O
as	O
you	O
said	O
mostly	O
they	O
are	O
token	O
cuts	O

uh	O
especially	O
what	O
for	O
instance	O
george	O
bush	O
is	O
offering	O

yeah	O

ninety-seven	O
cents	O
a	O
week	O

now	O
what	O

that	O
's	O
really	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
good	O
it	O
does	O
n't	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
your	O
average	O
middle	O
income	O
person	O
you	O
know	O

another	O
ninety-seven	O
cents	O

hell	O
you	O
can	O
buy	O
a	O
coke	O
or	O
something	O
for	O
that	O

yeah	O

that	O
ninety-seven	O
cents	O
really	O
is	O
n't	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
for	O
me	O
either	O

uh	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
have	O
n't	O
really	O
heard	O
much	O
of	O
what	O
the	O
other	O
people	O
other	O

have	O
said	O
that	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
sense	O
to	O
me	O
either	O

especially	O
the	O
democratic	O

do	O
n't	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
coming	O
up	O
with	O
much	O
that	O
really	O
sparks	O
my	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
yeah	O
maybe	O
that	O
could	O
do	O
something	O
to	O
affect	O
our	O

at	O
this	O
point	O

i	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
dukakis	O

but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
ca	O
n't	O

yeah	O

i	O
mean	O
that	O
's	O
better	O
than	O
george	O
bush	O
who	O
came	O
out	O
and	O
said	O
no	O

i	O
will	O
not	O

read	O
my	O

or	O
whatever	O
and	O
then	O
you	O

he	O

you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
ca	O
n't	O
follow	O
through	O
on	O
this	O

it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	BE_IP
uh	C
that	C
the	O

is	O
so	O
out	O

the	O

we	O

to	O
know	O
where	O
that	O
money	O
is	O
actually	O
going	O
to	O
go	O

because	O
in	O
my	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
i	O
'm	O
ever	O
going	O
to	O
see	O
any	O
of	O
this	O
peace	O
so-called	O
peace	O

i	O
mean	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
actually	O
put	O
something	O
together	O

make	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
in	O

either	O
because	O
i	O
feel	O
that	O
they	O
waste	O
money	O
also	O

but	O
with	O
this	O

it	O
seems	O
like	O
you	O
could	O
set	O
up	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
public	O
works	O
projects	O
like	O
they	O
had	O
in	O
the	O

or	O
whatever	O

right	O

ex-	BE_IP
exactly	C

and	O
in	O
that	O
way	O
we	O
could	O
really	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

yeah	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
there	O
's	O
no	O

from	BE_IP
from	C
the	O

that	O
we	O
're	O
in	O
right	O
now	O
unless	O
at	O

i	O
feel	O
unless	O
we	O

on	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
surely	O
do	O
n't	O

uh-huh	O

um	O
yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C

um	O
i	O

this	BE_IP
this	C_IP
it	C
just	O
seems	O
so	BE_IP
you	C

so	C
ridiculous	O
that	O
it	O
was	O

um	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
in	O

a	O

one	O
of	O

how	O
the	O

out	O

and	O
essentially	BE_IP
what	C

in	O
the	O
um	O

of	O
eighty-one	O
um	O

ronald	O

a	O

created	O
this	BE_IP
this	C
ludicrous	O

that	O
he	O

that	C

that	BE_IP

uh-huh	O

well	O
yeah	O

um	O
what	O
really	O
bothers	O
me	O

it	O

with	O
ninety-seven	O

a	O

i	O
just	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
well	O
thought	O
out	O
incentive	O

how	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
crime	O
in	O
the	O

you	O
say	O
you	O
're	O
from	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O

do	BE
you	IP
do	C
you	C

uh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

what	O

can	O
be	O

about	O
the	O

the	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
probably	O
agree	O
with	O
that	O

uh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
true	O

um	O
so	O
um	O
well	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
atlanta	O
's	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
most	O
other	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O

as	O
l	O
a	O
either	O

we	BE_IP

we	C

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
also	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
walking	O
in	O
a	O
downtown	O
area	O
you	O
know	O
where	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
crime	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
just	BE_IP
just	C
keeping	O
your	O
senses	O
about	O
you	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
trying	O
not	O
to	O
look	O

a	O

you	O

you	O
know	O
walk	O
bi-	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
walk	C
with	BE_IP
you	C

with	C
just	O
walk	O
in	O
a	O
confidently	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
do	BE
n't	IP
do	C
n't	C
be	O
looking	O

you	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
no	O

where	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O

yeah	O

have	BE
you	IP

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
pretty	O
lucky	O
about	O
getting	O

um	O
yeah	O

i	O
think	O
i	O
've	O
only	O
actually	O
seen	O
like	O
one	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
one	C
actual	O
robbery	O
with	O
a	O

and	O
that	O
's	O

about	O
the	O
only	O
you	O

where	O
you	O

potentially	O
violent	O

that	O
i	O
've	O

in	O
atlanta	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
a	O
guy	O
running	O
out	O
of	O
a	O

that	O
he	O
just	O
robbed	O

oh	O
really	O

oh	O
where	BE
was	IP
where	C_IP
where	C
was	C
that	O

was	O
that	O
downtown	O

or	O

really	O

metropolitan	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	BE
've	IP
actually	C
i	C
've	C
known	O
known	O
some	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
had	O
their	O
cars	O
stolen	O

uh	O
and	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
you	O
know	O
about	O
half	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
the	O
a	O
p	O
d	O
seems	O
to	O
recover	O
them	O
you	O
know	O
in	O
various	O
states	O
of	O
disrepair	O
up	O
on	O

my	O
friend	O
had	O
a	O

and	O
when	BE
he	IP
when	C
he	C

it	O

his	O
um	O

sitting	O
in	O
the	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
you	O
're	O
probably	O
luckier	O
than	O

uh-huh	O

um	O
so	O
like	O
does	O
insurance	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
body	O
damage	O

or	O
was	O
that	O
all	O
there	O
was	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

so	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
this	O
much	O
about	O
um	O
stealing	O
cars	O

right	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
i	C_IP
actually	C
i	C
live	O
in	O
the	O
city	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
concern	O
of	O
mine	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
safety	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

uh	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
bad	O
in	O
certain	O
areas	O

however	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
area	O
that	O
i	O
live	O
in	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
uh	O
the	O
crime	O

as	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
other	O
areas	O
of	BE
the	IP
of	C
the	C
city	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
certain	O
areas	O
where	O
uh	O
the	O
crime	O
is	O
focused	O
uh	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
it	BE
's	IP
what	C
's	C
been	C
happening	C
over	C
the	C
last	C
several	C
years	C
it	C
seems	C
they	O
've	O
been	O
beefing	O
up	O
the	O
police	O

trying	O
to	O
put	BE_IP
put	C
more	O
guys	O
more	O
cops	O
higher	O
visibility	O

and	O
uh	O
they	O
've	O
had	O
some	O
impact	O
but	O
not	O
a	O
tremendous	O
amount	O

and	O
probably	O
um	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
increase	O
community	O
involvement	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
thing	O
i	O
think	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
particularly	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
housing	O
projects	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
tends	C
to	O
be	O
where	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
crime	O
is	O
focused	O

and	O
they	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
do	O
more	O
than	O
just	O
having	BE_IP
having	C
cops	O
there	O

they	O
've	O
got	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
change	O
the	O
way	O
people	O

about	O
it	O

um	O
well	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
to	O

i	O
'd	O
say	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
probably	O
in	O
the	O
top	BE_IP
top	C
ten	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O

um	O
it	O
's	O
nowhere	BE_IP
near	C
as	O

for	O

that	O

kind	O
of	O
a	O

they	O
just	O
took	O
it	O
from	O
me	O
without	O
me	O

i	O

who	O

it	O

i	O
've	O

that	O

but	O
that	BE

that	C
's	C
about	O
it	O

oh	O
yeah	O

um	O

really	O

well	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
my	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
've	O
had	O
my	O
car	O
stolen	O

so	O
maybe	O
that	O
counts	O

yeah	O

oh	O
no	O

that	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
northern	O
p-	O
um	O
up	O
near	O
cumberland	O
mall	O
area	O

it	O
's	O
actually	O
cobb	O
county	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
atlanta	O

and	O
uh	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
car	O

in	O
that	O
area	O

right	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

mine	BE
was	IE
just	IP
it	C
had	C
been	C
wrecked	O
and	O
some	O
superficial	O
type	O
damage	O

but	O
they	BE
did	IE
n't	IP
they	C
did	C
n't	C
strip	O
it	O

so	O
i	O
got	O
it	O
back	O

yeah	O

than	O
most	O

right	O

it	O
was	O
about	O
three	O
grand	O
to	O
put	O
everything	O
together	O

they	O
cracked	O
the	O
steering	O
column	O
of	O
course	O
to	O
steal	O
the	O
car	O

yeah	O

you	BE
got	IE
to	IP
you	C
crack	C
the	O
steering	O
column	O

and	O
you	O
pull	O
the	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
pin	O
in	O
there	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
pull	O
on	O
these	O
g	O
m	O
cars	O

and	O
you	O
can	O
start	O
it	O
up	O
basically	O
pretty	O
easily	O

well	O
after	O
i	O
found	O
mine	O
i	BE
had	IE
to	IP
i	C
had	C
this	C

so	O
how	O
you	O
like	O
new	O
jersey	O

right	O

i	BE
guess	IP
uh	C
i	C
do	C
n't	C
know	C
what	O
part	O
of	O
new	O
jersey	O
you	O
're	O
in	O
but	O
i	O
guess	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
fairly	O
industrial	O

right	O
uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

right	O

right	O

well	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
about	O
you	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
always	O
considered	O
automobiles	O
to	O
be	O
probably	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
prime	O
contributor	O

i	O
mean	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
contributors	O

but	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
automobiles	O
would	O
probably	O
do	O
more	O
than	O
their	O
fair	O
share	O
of	O
that	O

yeah	O

that	BE
's	IP
yeah	C_IE
that	C_IE
's	C_IP
that	C
's	C
a	O
big	O
issue	O
is	O
you	O
know	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
states	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
uh	O
inspection	O
law	O

so	O
you	BE
get	IP
you	C
get	C
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
out	O
there	O
without	O
e	O
t	O
r	O
emission	O
control	O
systems	O
on	O
their	O
cars	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

yeah	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
like	O

sure	O

right	O

i	O
guess	O
from	O
what	O
i	O
hear	O
though	O
uh	O
next	O
year	O
ford	O
is	O
coming	O
out	O
with	O
their	O
electric	O
cars	O

they	O
're	O
actually	O
coming	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
prototypes	O
in	O
california	O

yeah	O

right	O

i	O
hope	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
'm	C
hoping	O
that	O
comes	O
along	O
quick	O

uh	O
i	O
was	O
reading	O
a	BE_IP
an	C
article	O
in	O
time	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
about	O
the	O
ozone	O
layer	O
and	O
how	O
fast	O
that	O
's	O
going	O

and	O
i	O
guess	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
really	O
disappearing	O
a	O
lot	O
quicker	O
than	O
people	O
realize	O

and	O
i	O
know	O
that	BE
's	IE
not	IE
due	IE
to	IP
uh	C
it	C
's	C
not	C
due	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
gasoline	O
or	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
carbon	O
monoxide	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
the	O
c	O
f	O
c	O
-s	O

but	O

uh	O
yeah	O

i	O
think	O
that	BE
's	IE
a	IP
that	C
's	C
a	C
contributor	O
definitely	O

right	O

right	O

yeah	O

i	O
guess	O
right	O
now	O
what	BE
they	IE
're	IP
what	C
they	C
're	C
primarily	O
worried	O
about	O
is	O
third	O
world	O
countries	O
because	O
i	O
guess	O
united	O
states	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
russia	O
have	O
kind	O
of	O
taken	O
the	O
lead	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
eliminating	O
c	O
f	O
c	O
production	O

but	O
it	O

go	O
ahead	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
arguments	O
that	O
the	O
third	O
world	O
countries	O
have	O
been	O
using	O
is	O
that	O
basically	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
our	O
mistakes	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
that	O
makes	O
any	O
sense	O

uh	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O

exactly	O

exactly	O

uh	O
those	BE
of	IE
kind	IE
of	IP
yeah	C
those	C
are	C
joining	O
arguments	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
an	O
interesting	O
situation	O
there	O

uh	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
realize	O
those	O
third	O
world	O
countries	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
realize	O
is	O
how	O
quickly	O
the	O
ozone	O
is	O
depleting	O

i	O
guess	O
the	O
latest	O
figures	O
are	O
up	O
to	O
fifty	O
percent	O
at	O
the	O
poles	O

and	O
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
increasing	O
even	O
as	O
far	O
near	O
the	O
equator	O
as	O
like	O
florida	O
and	O
cuba	O
and	O
those	O
places	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
interesting	O
situation	O

it	O
's	O
not	BE_IP
not	C
a	O
real	O
good	O
one	O
actually	O

but	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
get	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
source	O
of	O
cleansing	O
anymore	O

are	BE_IP
have	C
you	O
been	O
in	O
big	O

a	O
long	O
time	O

okay	O

so	O
you	O
've	O
got	O

yeah	O

those	O
are	O
actually	O
areas	O
that	O
are	O
hit	O
pretty	O
hard	O
i	O
would	O
think	O

yeah	O

denver	O
's	O
definitely	O

yeah	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O

sure	O

yeah	O

denver	O
's	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
real	O
good	O
e-	O
that	O
real	O
good	O
uh	O
example	O
of	O
sitting	O
in	O
a	O

kind	O
of	O
like	O
mexico	O
city	O
does	O
i	O
guess	O

mexico	O
city	O
is	O
historically	O
been	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C

for	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
been	O
pretty	O
lucky	O

i	O
've	O
lived	O
in	O

that	O
really	O
have	O
n't	O

that	O
much	O

uh	O
i	O

really	O
kind	O
of	O

in	O
orlando	O
florida	O

and	O
there	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
getting	O
worse	O

i	O
mean	O
it	BE_IP
it	C_IP
definitely	C
it	C
's	C
not	O
at	O
a	O
level	O
comparable	O
to	O
los	O

or	O
denver	O

but	O
you	O
can	O

exactly	O

yeah	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
much	O
in	O
terms	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
public	O

down	O
there	O

there	O

it	BE

it	C
's	C

uh	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
good	O
you	O

you	O
get	O
uh	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
uh	O

here	O

and	O
you	O
do	O
get	O
a	O
good	O

of	O
uh	O

especially	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
uh	O

it	O
's	O

when	O
you	O

it	O

uh	O

oh	O

have	O
some	O
vacation	O

or	O
some	BE_IP
some	C
sick	O
leave	O
or	O
whatever	O
um	O
you	O
kind	O
of	O
have	O
to	O
finagle	O
your	O
way	O
around	O
to	O
get	O
that	O
time	O

so	O
that	BE
's	IP
that	C
's	C
kind	O
of	O
a	O
drawback	O
i	O
think	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

what	O
do	O
you	O
consider	O
most	O
important	O
you	O
think	O
in	O
terms	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O
different	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
saw	O
on	O
twenty	O
twenty	O
the	O
other	O
night	O

they	BE_IP
uh	C
they	C
basically	O
reviewed	O
oregon	O
's	O
plan	O
or	O
the	O
oregon	O
plan	O
toward	O
uh	O
nationalizing	O
health	O
care	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
interesting	O
plan	O

it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
cold	O
though	O

they	O
've	O
essentially	O
made	O
up	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
uh	O
oh	O
all	O
the	O
different	O
uh	O
medical	O
maladies	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
and	O
then	O
basically	O
made	O
a	O
cutoff	O

about	O
six	O
hundred	O
and	O
eighty-seven	O
and	O
below	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
covered	O
by	BE_IP
by	C
uh	O
subsidized	O
health	O
care	O

and	O
the	O
ones	O
above	O
would	O

so	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
drawing	O
this	O
line	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
if	O
you	O
have	O
it	O
great	O

if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
you	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
out	O
of	O
luck	O

but	O
um	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
interesting	O
show	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
're	O
right	O

i	O
think	O
health	O
care	O
is	O
probably	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
most	O
pressing	O
uh	O
the	O
pressing	O
one	O

but	O
i	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
mind	O
having	O
dental	O
you	O
know	O

sometimes	O
dental	O
costs	O
can	O
be	O
um	O
just	O
about	O
as	O
expensive	O
if	O
not	O
more	O

and	O
i	BE
know	IE
historically	IP
a	C

i	C

carried	C
dental	C
as	O
a	O

along	O

how	BE_IP

it	O

um	O

great	O

is	BE
that	IP

the	O

for	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
okay	O

i	O

because	O
i	BE

that	C
's	C
the	O

uh	O

yeah	O

that	BE

that	C
's	C
interesting	O

that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
i	O
'd	O

to	O

about	O

in	O
what	O

they	BE

uh	C
they	C

oh	O

that	O
right	O

okay	O

all	O
right	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

i	O
work	O
for	O
the	O
university	O

and	O
uh	O
our	O

package	O
is	BE
n't	IP
uh	C
is	C
n't	C
quite	O
as	O
good	O
in	O
some	O
ways	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

overall	O
i	O
'm	O
satisfied	O
with	O
it	O

we	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
the	O
vision	O

we	O
do	O
have	O
the	O

the	C

uh	O

no	O

i	BE

uh	O
so	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C
benefits	O

uh	O
probably	O
the	O
main	O
thing	O
i	O

about	O
the	O

is	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C
uh	O
very	O
generous	O

we	O

fifteen	O

a	O

uh	O
we	O

twenty-four	O

uh	O
time	O

yeah	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
health	O
care	O
of	O
course	O
is	O
an	O
important	O
and	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
single	O
most	O
important	O
benefit	O

and	O
uh	O
the	O
rates	O
that	O
we	O
keep	O
paying	O
seem	O
to	O
keep	O
increasing	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

i	BE
'm	IP
i	C
'm	C
a	O
little	O
disturbed	O
about	O
that	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
national	O
trend	O

and	O
i	BE
do	IE
n't	IE
know	IE
that	IP
uh	C
i	C
do	C
n't	C
know	C
what	C
the	O
solution	O
is	O
to	O
it	O

it	O
's	O
bigger	O
than	O
just	O
the	O

part	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

oh	O
yeah	O

um	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
we	O
have	O
two	O
different	O
plans	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
subscribe	O
to	O
under	O
dental	O
uh	O
depending	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O
cost	O
between	O
them	O
is	BE
very	IP
is	C
very	C
little	O

i	O
think	O
it	O
costs	O
me	O
something	O
like	O
five	O
dollars	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
month	O
for	O
the	O
dental	O
plan	O

but	O
it	O
pays	O
uh	O
a	O
substantial	O
amount	O

i	O
mean	O
the	O
examinations	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
uh	O
checkups	O
every	O
year	O
or	O
every	O
six	O
months	O
are	O
free	O

and	O
uh	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
covers	O
the	O
bulk	O
of	O
the	O
dental	O
expenses	O

uh	O
yes	O

it	O
is	O

the	O
benefits	O
plan	O
is	O
different	O
for	O
operating	O
for	O
what	O
we	O

the	O
p	O
a	O

the	O
main	O

i	O
think	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
health	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
dental	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
for	O

the	O

the	O

is	O
in	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C

you	BE

uh	C

a	O

or	O
anything	O

or	O

yeah	O

you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
something	O
i	O
miss	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

all	O
right	O

yeah	O

my	O
brother	O
was	O
uh	O
a	O
guide	O
for	O
bear	O
and	O
elk	O
hunts	O
out	O
in	O
idaho	O
for	O
a	O

uh	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
it	O
quite	O
a	O
bit	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
guess	O
that	O
what	O
the	O
scale	O
now	O
is	O
it	O
's	O
zero	O
for	BE_IP
uh	C
for	C
a	O
complete	O

that	O
's	O
right	O

i	O
guess	O
i	O
am	O
about	O
eight	O
or	O
nine	O

yeah	O

no	O
doubt	O
about	O
it	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

if	BE
there	IE
's	IP
if	C
there	C
's	C
a	O
way	O
you	O
know	O
to	O
limited	O
it	O
to	O
people	O
that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O

they	BE_IP
i	C
guess	C
they	C
passed	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
uh	O
uh	O
laws	O
a	O
here	O
while	O
back	O
in	O
some	O
states	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
a	O
waiting	O
period	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
hand	O
gun	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
actually	O
uh	O

i	O
know	O
it	O
's	O
this	O
way	O
in	O
florida	O

they	O
have	O
a	O
waiting	O
period	O
where	O
you	O
buy	O
one	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
check	O
you	O
out	O
and	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
record	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
idea	O

uh	O
and	O
that	O
's	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

that	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
bad	O
idea	O

but	O
then	O
again	O
you	O
can	O
always	O
get	O
around	O
that	O

you	O
could	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
black	O
market	O
like	O
you	O
say	O

you	O
know	O
you	O
always	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
around	O

but	O
uh	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
things	O

but	O
uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	BE
guess	IP
i	C
guess	C
some	O
forms	O
of	O
guns	O
should	O
probably	O
be	O
controlled	O
just	O
like	O
i	O
'm	O
not	O
real	O
sure	O
why	O
anybody	O
would	O
need	O
a	O
full	O
automatic	O
weapon	O

yeah	O

i	O
'm	O
just	O
not	O

i	O
think	O
those	O
have	O
been	O
pretty	O
much	O
you	O
know	O
banned	O
altogether	O
anyway	O

there	O

it	O
kind	O

i	BE_IP
uh	C
i	C

uh	O

uh	O
do	O
you	O
live	O
in	BE
a	IP
in	C_IE
a	C_IP
in	C
a	C
fairly	O
rural	O

uh	O

or	O

oh	O
i	O
see	O

um	O

yeah	O

it	O
's	O
not	O
that	O
big	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O

with	O
domino	O
she	O
was	O
full	O

i	O
would	O
estimate	O
seventy	O

and	O
you	O

we	O
lived	O
in	O
oviedo	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
small	O

it	O
's	O
a	O

but	O
there	BE

there	C
was	C

a	O

for	O
her	O

around	O

and	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
dog	O
that	O
loved	O
to	O
run	O

so	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
biggest	O
problem	O
i	O
saw	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
the	BE_IP
uh	C
the	C
issues	O
people	O
need	O
to	O

about	O

you	O

do	O
you	O
have	O
the	O

for	O
this	O

to	O
run	O
around	O

or	O
s-	BE_IP
you	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
really	O

for	O
cats	O

me	O
and	O
cats	O
do	O
n't	O

uh	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
whole	O
space	O

i	O
think	O
is	O
real	O
important	O

right	O

yeah	O

that	BE_IP
that	C

sure	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
all	BE

my	O

out	O

she	O
's	O

and	O
you	O

we	BE_IP

we	C
had	O
a	O

when	O

uh	O

yes	O

we	O
do	O
have	O
a	O

we	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
dog	O
that	O
we	O
got	O
from	O
the	O
uh	O

well	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
the	O

c	O
a	O

it	O
's	O
the	O
uh	O
an-	BE_IP
from	O
an	O

uh	O
he	O
'd	O
come	O
in	O

as	O
a	O

uh	O
he	O
's	O
a	O
pomeranian	O
and	O
sheltie	O

uh	O
well	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
trained	O
when	O
we	O

him	O

uh	O
he	O
's	O

no	O
uh	O

we	O
suspect	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
hurt	O
in	O
an	O

you	O
know	O
got	O
away	O
from	O
somebody	O
traveling	O
through	O
and	O
hurt	O
in	O
an	O

because	O
a	O
dog	O
that	O
looks	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
he	O
does	O
and	O
is	O
trained	O
as	O
well	O
is	O
someone	O
that	O
has	O
lost	O
him	O
and	O
not	O
have	O
been	O

to	O

him	O

and	O
uh	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
local	O
people	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
find	O
him	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
i	O
think	O
so	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

well	O
i	O
guess	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
we	O
felt	O
that	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
's	C
nice	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
dog	O
even	O
though	O
there	O
are	O
you	O
know	O
complications	O
come	O
with	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
with	O
our	O
children	O
uh	O

at	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
oh	O
grade	O
five	O
and	BE_IP
and	C
grade	O
eight	O

so	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
age	O
where	O
it	BE
was	IP
uh	C
we	C
thought	C
it	C
was	C
be	O
good	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
discipline	O
that	O
goes	O
with	BE_IP
with	C
having	O
a	O
pet	O

uh	O

yeah	O

right	O

so	O

well	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
idea	O

i	O
think	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
perhaps	O

uh	O
it	O
depends	O
on	BE
the	IP
on	C
everyone	O
's	O
discipline	O

and	O
uh	O
from	O
that	O
aspect	O
i	O
'm	O
short	O
on	O
the	O
discipline	O
because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
uh	O
enforce	O
that	O
the	O
kids	O
look	O
after	O
the	O
dog	O

and	O
uh	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
him	O
about	O
four	O
years	O
now	O

uh	O
but	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
does	O
it	BE_IP
it	C
you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
necessary	O
that	O
individuals	O
have	O
the	O
discipline	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
the	O
animal	O
properly	O
uh	O

yeah	O

uh	O

actually	O
no	O

we	O
live	O
in	BE
a	IP
in	C
an	C
area	O
that	O
's	O
oh	O
probably	O
about	O
two	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
university	O

uh	O
we	BE
live	IP
right	C
might	C
say	C
we	C
live	C
right	O
in	BE_IP
uh	C
in	C
the	O
middle	O
of	O
a	O
residential	O
area	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
so	C
that	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O

this	O
dog	O
being	O
a	O
small	O
dog	O
it	O
's	O
uh	O
more	O
you	O
more	O
acceptable	O

but	O
again	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

it	BE
's	IP
uh	C
that	C
's	C
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
concerns	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
uh	O

there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
to	O
be	O
gained	O
from	O
a	O
relationship	O
with	O
an	O
animal	O

but	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
one	O
has	O
to	O
recognize	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
physical	O
requirements	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O
animal	O

and	O
the	O
larger	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
more	O

they	O

right	O

well	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O

uh	O
i	BE_IP

you	O

the	BE_IP

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh	O
i	BE_IP

uh	O
i	O

my	O

over	O
uh	O
e-	BE_IP
even	C
within	C
the	O

uh	O

at	O

you	O

uh	O

you	O

that	O

the	O

for	O

the	BE_IP

the	C
more	O

now	O
i	O

and	O
then	O

i	O

that	O

uh	O
a	O
good	O

uh	O

yeah	O

uh	O
yeah	O

it	O
seems	O

and	O
failsafe	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IP
uh	C
i	C
do	O
n't	O

you	O

not	O
completely	O

if	O

uh	O
you	O

there	O

the	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
uh	O
do	O
you	O

i	BE

you	O

uh	O
that	O

uh	O
uh	O
something	O

uh	O
well	O
here	O

we	O

the	O

here	O

it	O

we	O

a	O
lot	BE

of	C
problems	O
with	O

but	O
uh	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
some	O

are	O
just	O
so	O
heinous	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
the	O

just	O
i	O

for	O
the	O

i	O

there	O
's	O
a	O

they	O

you	O

someone	O

you	O

it	O
then	O
that	O

you	C

it	O
just	O
seems	O

for	O

the	O
jeffrey	O

i	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O

that	O
this	O

i	O
hope	O
the	O

never	O
gets	O
back	O
out	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
wisconsin	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
death	O

so	O
he	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
sentenced	O
to	O
life	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
he	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
live	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
then	O
you	O
're	O
kind	O
of	O
playing	O
god	O
which	O
is	O
n-	BE_IP
never	C
a	O
good	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O

but	O
cases	O
where	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
death	O

should	O
be	O
withheld	O
uh	O
not	O
really	O
that	O
i	O
can	O
think	O
of	O

i	BE_IP
i	C_IE
would	C_IP
i	C
would	C
be	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
things	O

you	O

like	O
you	O

or	O

uh	O
i	O
do	O

really	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
uh	O
death	O

for	O
people	O
like	O

and	O
such	O
as	O

i	O

that	O
they	BE

they	C

up	O
here	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
really	O
think	O
that	BE_IP
that	C
it	BE
's	IP
it	C
's	C
in	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

steve	O

we	O

some	O

how	O

you	O

you	O

to	O

thirty	O
or	O
forty	O

only	O
one	O

then	O
uh	O
something	O

the	O

uh	O

uh	O
they	O

and	O
not	O
just	O

around	O
all	O
the	O

so	O
you	O

upon	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

of	O
the	O

we	BE_IP
uh	C
we	C
uh	O

a	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
steven	O
it	O

well	O
ourselves	O
we	O

i	O

never	O

to	O

for	O
child	O

our	O
kids	O
are	O
now	O
fourteen	O
and	O
eighteen	O

but	BE_IP
uh	C
and	C
so	C
you	O
know	O
you	O
go	O
back	O
those	O
many	O
years	O
and	O
uh	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
very	O
much	O

we	BE_IP
i	C
guess	C
we	C
were	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
looking	O
at	O
uh	O
two	O
family	O
income	O
at	O
the	O

and	O
our	O

were	O

but	O
i	O
've	O
had	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
uh	O
you	O

friends	O
of	O
ours	O
that	O
have	O
used	O
child	O

and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O

uh	O
so	O
it	O

my	O
involvement	O
has	O
n't	O
been	O
direct	O

but	O
still	O
have	O
been	O
you	O

certainly	O

to	O
criteria	O
people	O
are	O

how	O
about	O
yourself	O

right	O

right	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
kind	O
of	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
some	BE
of	IE
our	IE
friends	IP
or	C
even	C
our	C
own	C
children	C
will	O

in	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
they	O
may	O
need	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
child	O
care	O

but	O
even	O
you	O
know	O
here	O
i	O
guess	O
we	O
have	O
in	O
one	O
sense	O
two	O
forms	O
of	O
uh	O
child	O
care	O

there	O
's	O
where	O
individuals	O
will	O
in	O
one	O
primarily	O
babysit	O
children	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
home	O

and	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
groups	O
of	O
anywhere	O
from	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
to	O
maybe	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
children	O

and	O
then	O
otherwise	O
there	O
will	O
be	O

the	O
majority	O
are	O
co-operative	O
day-cares	O

uh	O
people	O
form	O
a	O
co-op	O
and	O
uh	O
parents	O
will	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
co-op	O
and	O
put	O
a	O
fair	O
number	O
of	O
hours	O

frequently	O
they	O
will	O
hire	O
staff	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
day-care	O

and	O
the	O
emphasis	O
is	O
primarily	O
uh	O
someplace	O
for	O
the	O

to	O
be	O

but	O
at	O
the	O

at	O
certain	O

a	O

and	O
go	O
there	O

you	O
know	O
where	O
i	O
use	O
to	O
work	O
we	O
had	O
what	O
we	O
called	O
tree	O
boxes	O

that	O
's	O
just	O
what	O
we	O
called	O
them	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
recycled	O
cardboard	O

they	O
were	O
eight	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
by	O

and	O
you	O
set	O
it	O
by	O
your	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
as	O
you	O
got	O
rid	O
of	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O

you	O
stuck	O
it	O
in	O
there	O

and	O
when	O
it	O

you	O

you	O

whoever	O
to	O
come	BE_IP
pick	C
it	O
up	O

and	O
they	O
brought	O
you	O
another	O
box	O

so	O
not	O
only	O
is	O
it	O
you	O
know	O

i	O
think	O
more	O
people	O
would	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
use	O
it	O
uh	O

i	O
think	O
you	O
save	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
cleaning	O
service	O
's	O
time	O
and	O
effort	O
and	O
money	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
paying	O
for	O
them	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
empty	O
the	O
trash	O

and	O
combine	O
it	O
and	O
bundle	O
it	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
now	O
when	O
it	O
could	O
all	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
one	O
step	O
kind	O
of	O
type	O
thing	O

so	O

right	O

if	O

right	O

but	O
somebody	O
still	O
has	O
to	O
collect	O
all	O
that	O
and	O
bundle	O
it	O
together	O

and	O
whereas	O
if	O
you	O
had	O
a	O
box	O
that	O
pretty	O
soon	O
it	O
got	O
full	O
you	O
close	O
the	O
box	O
it	O
's	O
already	O
bundled	O
it	O
's	O
already	O
done	O
for	O
you	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
saving	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
effort	O

i	O
just	O
need	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
paper	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
somebody	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
thinks	O
it	O
's	O
feasible	O

so	O
uh	O
what	O
else	O
do	O
they	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
dallas	O
area	O

uh-huh	O

um	O

anything	O
extra	O

that	O
sounds	O
good	O

there	O
's	O

i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
been	O
wanting	O
to	O
put	O
like	O
two	O
of	O
three	O
bins	O
like	O
right	O
out	O
my	O
garage	O
door	O
where	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
from	C
the	O
kitchen	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
can	O
throw	O
cans	O
in	O
one	O
or	O
the	O
glass	O
in	O
the	O
other	O

or	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
even	O
uh	O

there	O
are	O
areas	O
that	O
can	O
recycle	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
tin	O
cans	O
like	O
your	O
you	O
know	O
vegetable	O
things	O
come	O
in	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C
so	C
i	BE_IP
i	C
've	C
not	O
done	O
that	O

but	O
that	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
what	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
so	O
because	O
we	O
do	O
go	O
through	O
aluminum	O
cans	O
you	O
know	O

that	O
's	O
probably	O
the	O
one	O
we	O
use	O
most	O

uh	O
but	O

find	O
a	O
place	O

well	O
uh	O
uh	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
do	O
have	O
facilities	O
for	O
recycling	O
the	O
newspapers	O
aluminum	O
cans	O
those	O
are	O
the	O
two	O
major	O
items	O

you	O
know	O
we	O
can	O
take	O
oil	O
like	O
car	O
oil	O
recycled	O
oil	O
to	O

they	O
have	O
uh	O
uh	O
dump	O
areas	O
like	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
departments	O
throughout	O
town	O

uh	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
yet	O
have	O
the	O
facilities	O
here	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
tin	O
cans	O

uh	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
the	O
plastics	O
like	O
the	O
liter	O
bottles	O
things	O
like	O
that	O

uh	O
but	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
do	O
n't	O
know	O

i	O
know	O
for	O
sure	O
though	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
newspaper	O
and	O
the	O
aluminum	O
can	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
oil	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
departments	O

so	O

i	O
do	O
that	O

i	O
think	O
people	O
are	O
becoming	O
more	O
aware	O
you	O
know	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
the	O
waste	O

and	O
you	O
know	O
i	BE_IP
i	C
like	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
know	O

you	O
drive	O
through	O
burger	O
king	O
now	O
and	O
the	O
bags	O
are	O
recycled	O
paper	O

and	BE_IP
you	C
know	C
so	C
you	O
know	O
i	O
feel	O
like	O
people	O
are	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O
or	O
becoming	O
more	O
aware	O
of	O
it	O

you	O
know	O
maybe	O
it	O
's	O
making	O
an	O
impact	O

i	O
'm	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
about	O
searching	O
something	O
out	O
like	O
that	O

but	O
if	O
i	O
am	O
there	O
and	O
the	O
choice	O
is	O
there	O
i	O
would	O
probably	O
take	O
the	O
recycled	O
product	O

so	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
's	O
just	O
where	O
i	O
probably	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
responsible	O
citizen	O
wise	O
you	O
know	O
looking	O
or	O
searching	O
those	O
out	O
because	O
you	O
figure	O
if	BE
we	IP
as	C
the	C
citizens	O
do	O
that	O
then	O
the	O
manufactures	O
and	O
producers	O
will	O
start	O
packaging	O
it	O
that	O
way	O

so	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
are	O
getting	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
styrofoam	O

okay	O

uh	O
well	O
yeah	O

for	O
the	O
last	O
uh	O
couple	O
of	O
months	O

yeah	O

well	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	O
to	O
say	O

uh	O
because	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
buy	O
another	O
car	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
years	O

we	O
just	O
bought	O
uh	O
a	O
car	O
uh	O
last	O
year	O
and	O
then	O
bought	O
one	O
in	O
eighty-nine	O

and	O
uh	O

wait	O
a	O
minute	O

we	O
bought	O
one	O
in	O
ninety	O

we	O
've	O
got	O
three	O
cars	O
of	O
all	O
things	O

so	O
uh	O
probably	O
we	O
'll	O
be	O
in	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
midsize	O
four	O
door	O
sedan	O

uh	O
we	O
have	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
mazda	O
nine	O
twenty	O
nine	O
and	O
a	O
ford	O
crown	O
victoria	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
two	O

c	O
r	O
x	O

uh	O
it	O
's	O
rather	O
difficult	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
project	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
uh	O

we	O
'd	O
look	BE_IP
always	C
look	C
into	O
uh	O
consumer	O
reports	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
uh	O
report	O
or	O
uh	O
repair	O
records	O
that	O
the	O
various	O
cars	O
have	O

and	O
then	O
of	O
course	O
we	O
look	O
into	O
the	O
prices	O

and	O
uh	O
f-	BE_IP
uh	O
we	O
're	O
not	O
adverse	O
to	O
buying	O
along	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
when	BE_IP
when	C
the	O
cars	O
could	O
get	O
to	O
be	O
discounted	O

because	O
we	BE
keep	IP
we	C
've	C
begun	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
uh	O
long-	O
a	O
longer	O
period	O
of	O
time	O

uh	O
i	O
traded	O
off	O
an	O
eighty-two	O
oldsmobile	O
for	O
the	O
eighty-nine	O
mazda	O

so	O
uh	O

uh	O
yeah	O

yeah	O

we	BE_IP
we	C
've	C
had	O
thirty	O
some	O
odd	O
cars	O
in	O
our	O
married	O
life	O

and	O
uh	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
've	C
had	O
a	O
good	O
many	O
foreign	O
cars	O

and	O
uh	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
uh	O

i	O
've	O
been	O
extremely	O

we	O
've	O
had	O
three	O
mazdas	O

we	O
've	O
been	O
extremely	O

with	O
our	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

well	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
've	C
had	O
uh	O

let	O
's	O
see	O

we	BE
had	IP
uh	C
we	C
had	C
a	O
uh	O

let	O
me	O
think	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
fifty-three	O

and	O
a	BE_IP
uh	O
we	O

uh	O
two	O
fifty-threes	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
long	O
thirty	O
minute	O

uh	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
sixty-five	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
this	O
eighty-two	O

so	O
we	BE_IP
we	C
really	O
ca	O
n't	O
complain	O
about	O
oldsmobiles	O
really	O

yeah	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O

uh	O
my	O

uh	O
sold	O
porsches	O
audis	O
mad-	O
mazdas	O
and	O
volkswagons	O
for	O
ten	O
years	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
deciding	O
factors	O
in	O
getting	O
the	O
mazdas	O

uh	O
so	O
uh	O
the	O
first	O
foreign	O
car	O
that	O
we	O

was	O
a	BE_IP
a	C
seventy-seven	O

my	O

and	O

uh	O
we	O

to	O
sell	O
it	O

w-	BE_IP

and	O
then	O
uh	O
when	O

well	O
we	O
bought	O
a	O
second	O

we	BE_IP
uh	C

that	O
uh	O

we	O
had	O
this	O
uh	O
sixty-five	O
oldsmobile	O

and	BE
it	IP
and	C
it	C

so	O
we	BE_IP
we	C

a	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

we	O
've	O
been	O
real	O

with	O
ours	O

i	O
think	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
one	O
two	O
three	O

and	O
most	O

we	BE
have	IE
a	IE
cutlass	IP
we	C
still	C
have	C
a	C
cutlass	C
supreme	O
which	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
seventy-seven	O

then	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
cutlass	O
sierra	O

and	O
we	O
've	O
had	O
the	O
ninety-eight	O

so	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O

we	BE
'll	IP
we	C
're	C
going	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
market	O
for	O
a	O
car	O
probably	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
year	O

and	O
the	O
financing	O
is	O
always	O
something	O
we	O
consider	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
four	O
percent	O
or	O
when	O
they	O
give	O
good	O
financing	O
through	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
motor	O
company	O

but	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
buy	O

i	O
always	O
thought	O
i	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
foreign	O
made	O
car	O

but	O
boy	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
auto	O
workers	O
being	O
laid	O
off	O
makes	O
me	O
feel	O
guilty	O

so	O

oh	O

oh	O
the	O

ooh	O
boy	O

i	O
'll	O
bet	O
it	O
was	O
hard	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
that	O

oh	O

oh	O
yeah	O

oh	O

so	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
caring	O
for	O
older	O
folks	O
dale	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

very	O
definitely	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
i	O
'm	O
thinking	O
about	O
it	O
more	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
my	O
parents	O
that	O
are	O
starting	O
to	O
get	O
old	O

they	O
are	O
n't	O
really	O
that	O
old	O

but	O
they	O
are	O
sort	O
of	O
wearing	O
out	O

my	O
mamma	O
is	O
a	O
dialysis	O
patient	O

and	O
she	O
is	O
only	O
about	O
sixty-four	O

but	O
she	O
's	O
had	O
some	O
pretty	O
close	O
calls	O

and	O
my	O
daddy	O
has	O
to	O
drive	O
her	O
to	O
dialysis	O
now	O

and	O
so	O
she	O
's	O
phasing	O
out	O
sounds	O
like	O
and	BE_IP
but	C
she	O
's	O
also	O
a	O
very	O
very	O
very	O
independent	O
person	O
and	O
does	O
n't	O
like	O
having	BE_IP
having	C
people	O
uh	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
things	O
for	O
herself	O
when	O
she	O
wants	O
to	O

uh	O
i	O
know	O
they	O
certainly	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

but	O
my	O
daddy	O
keeps	O
talking	O
about	O
it	O

i	O
do	O
n't	O

i	O
could	BE
n't	IE
possibly	IP
could	C
n't	C
never	C
see	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O
home	O

and	O
my	O
grand	O
daddy	O
also	O
does	BE
n't	IE
like	IP
would	C
n't	C
want	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
nursing	O

he	O
's	O
ninety	O
i	O
think	O
right	O
on	O
ninety	O
right	O
now	O

and	O
he	O
's	O
living	O
by	O
himself	O

my	O
grand	O
mamma	O
died	O
a	O

of	O

that	O

just	O

uh-huh	O
very	O

right	O

uh-huh	O

right	O

to	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
true	O

you	O

those	O

but	O
you	O
can	O

and	BE_IP
uh	C

tell	O

about	O
the	O

i	O

you	O

your	O

that	O

uh	O
being	O

to	O

you	O
can	O
perhaps	O
get	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
are	O
n't	O
too	O
far	O
along	O
with	O

about	O

that	O

do	O
they	O

to	O
listen	O
to	O
other	O

though	O

right	O

well	O
that	O
is	O
good	O
because	O
we	O

well	O
i	O
think	O
uh	O
the	O

is	O
a	O
really	O
neat	O
population	O
to	O

they	O
've	O

a	O

of	O
special	O

and	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
uh	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
them	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
give	O
up	O
the	O

that	O
they	O
have	O

and	O
so	O
you	O
've	O

a	O

to	O

there	O

what	O
about	O
you	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

oh	O
really	O

oh	O
okay	O

yeah	O

but	O
it	O
gets	O
hard	O

my	BE_IP
my	C
grandmother	O
is	O
in	O
her	O
mid	O
eighties	O

and	O
she	O
's	O
uh	O
suffering	O
from	O
uh	O
well	O
uh	O
progressive	O
alzheimer	O
's	O

so	O
she	O
does	O
n't	O
remember	O
anybody	O

and	O
uh	O
she	O
remembers	O
things	O

but	O
they	O
are	O
things	O
back	O
whenever	O
she	O

and	O
so	O
with	O

she	O
was	O

my	O
uh	O

has	O
moved	O
in	O
with	O
her	O
to	O
take	O

of	O
her	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
creating	O
a	O

of	O

oh	O
yes	O

yes	O

in	O
dallas	O

uh	O
yeah	O

i	BE
've	IP
i	C
've	C

they	O

if	O
you	O

up	O
with	O

but	O
sometimes	O
it	O
's	O
hard	O
to	O
either	O

the	O

to	O

them	O

uh	O
to	O
be	O

them	O
there	O
for	O
the	O

up	O

right	O

oh	O
really	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

well	O
it	BE_IP

it	C
's	C
a	O

everything	O

that	O
that	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
things	O
to	O

but	O
i	O
think	O
the	O
hardest	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
whenever	O
you	O
've	O

a	O
person	O
who	O
's	O

and	O
their	O

just	O

and	O
i	O

that	O
's	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
it	O
's	O
more	O
some	BE_IP
an	C
area	O
where	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

uh	O

left	O
off	O

because	O
you	O

a	O
little	O

to	O
be	O

those	O

right	O

i	O

one	O
not	O
too	O

from	BE_IP
from	C

they	O

that	O
's	O

uh-huh	O

uh-huh	O

and	O
they	O

you	O

they	O

my	O

she	BE_IP
she	C

i-	O

that	BE

uh	C
that	C

something	O
i	O
've	O

uh	O
i	O
had	O
a	O

uh	O
that	O
i	O
worked	O
with	O
that	O
was	O
from	O
sweden	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
uh	O

probably	O
the	BE_IP
the	C
major	O
concern	O
i	O
have	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
are	O
leading	O
in	O
the	O
technology	O
realm	O
of	BE_IP
of	C
medicine	O
just	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
great	O
incentive	O
to	BE_IP
to	C
get	O
into	O
uh	O
the	O
medical	O
field	O

but	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
it	O
's	O
real	O
hard	O

i	O
mean	O
my	O
husband	O
works	O
for	O
a	O

that	O

and	O
so	O
you	O

you	O
know	O

it	O
's	O
like	O
well	O
you	O

you	O

there	O
's	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
ways	O
you	O

to	O
do	O
some	O
things	O

but	O
you	O
know	O
i	O
hate	O
to	O
uh	O

the	BE_IP
the	C
competition	O
i-	BE_IP
in	C
a	C
lot	C
of	C
ways	C
is	BE_IP
is	C
wonderful	O
just	O
because	O
you	O
can	O
choose	O
your	O

and	BE_IP
and	C
uh	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
compete	O
to	BE
be	IP
to	C
be	C
good	O
and	O
to	O
be	O

but	O
at	O
the	O

there	BE
's	IE
a	IP
you	C

they	C
're	C

and	BE_IP
and	C
the	O

my	BE_IP

for	O
something	O
that	O
he	O

wholesale	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O
sure	O
they	O
can	O
get	O
a	O

cheaper	O
because	O
they	BE_IP
they	C
hospitals	O

you	O

you	O
twenty	O

fifty	O
item	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
ridiculous	O

and	O
i	O
do	O

that	BE

i	BE_IP
i	C

the	O

dramatically	O
um	O
in	BE
the	IP
in	C
the	C
last	O
number	O

and	O
i	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
something	O
that	O
if	BE_IP
if	C
they	O
could	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
that	O
and	O

um	O

i	BE
lived	IP
i	C
lived	C
in	O
sweden	O
for	O
two	O
years	O

and	O
in	O
sweden	O
they	O
have	O
socialized	O
medicine	O

and	O
so	O
i	O
saw	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
good	O

and	O
also	O
i	O
saw	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
bad	O
that	O
results	O
from	O
such	O
a	O

uh	O
some	BE
of	IE
the	IP
some	C
of	C
the	C
good	O
obviously	O
that	O
nobody	O
has	O
to	O

about	O

so	O
it	BE
's	IE
a	IE
very	IP
it	C
's	C
a	C
very	C
uh	O
comfortable	O

i	O
mean	O
our	O

are	O
very	O
comfortable	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
you	O

there	O
's	O
no	O

that	O
's	O
going	O
to	O

you	O

for	O

um	O
the	O
bad	O
was	O
more	O
apparent	O
i	O
think	O
at	O

for	O
me	O

because	O
i	O
think	O
it	O
affected	O
people	O
's	O
lives	O
on	BE_IP
in	C
a	O
way	O
that	O
you	O
could	O
see	O

one	BE_IP
one	C
thing	O
that	O
i	O
noticed	O
is	O
it	O
's	O
very	BE_IP
very	C
convenient	O
to	O
be	O
alcoholic	O
in	O
sweden	O

because	O
it	O
's	O
treated	O
as	O
a	O
disease	O

now	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
necessarily	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
part	O
of	O

but	O
uh	O
if	BE
you	IE

if	C

you	O
're	O

on	O

and	O
so	O
there	O
was	O
very	O

for	O

to	O
get	O
out	O

that	O

also	O
um	O
another	O

that	BE_IP
that	C
i	O

i	BE

uh	C
i	C
would	C
go	O
down	O

uh	O
uh	O

i	O
remember	O
this	O
one	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
uh	O
row	O

or	O

all	O

so	O
it	O

well	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
lower	O
middle-class	O

here	O

it	O
's	O
probably	O
middle-class	O

there	O

um	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

their	BE_IP

there	O

that	BE_IP

uh	O
overall	O
i	O

their	BE_IP

off	O
here	O

uh	O
i	O
do	O

or	O
from	O
c	O
n	O
n	O

uh	O

keep	O
a	O
rather	O

the	O

a	O

you	O

a	BE_IP
a	C

a	O

about	O

it	BE

we	C

a	O

i	O

it	O

uh	O
uh	O

it	BE

what	O

it	O

it	BE

uh	C_IE

uh	O
oh	O
i	O

the	BE_IP
the	C

uh	O
i	BE_IP
it	C

they	BE_IP

uh	O
uh	O
the	BE_IP
the	C

it	BE_IP

we	O

he	O
just	O

his	O

we	O

and	O
uh	O
he	O

that	O
we	O
might	O
just	O

all	O

off	O

he	O
'd	O
probably	O
look	O
pretty	O
funny	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
that	O

he	BE_IP
actually	C
he	C
just	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
vet	O
yesterday	O
to	O
get	O
his	O

everything	O

and	O
they	O

him	O
on	O

and	O
he	O
's	O
up	O

a	C

uh	O

a	O

oh	O

uh-huh	O

that	O
's	O

they	O

though	O

uh	O

you	O

that	O
they	O
're	O
good	O
around	O
other	O

no	O

he	O

we	BE_IP
we	C

in	O
a	BE_IP
not	C
a	C

more	O
so	O
than	O
i	O

want	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
out	O
too	O
much	O

and	O
he	O
does	O

it	O
if	O
we	O

him	O

he	O
's	O
really	O
a	O
wimp	O

and	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
being	O
alone	O

uh	O
now	O
if	O
you	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
freedom	O
to	O
walk	O
around	O
and	O
go	O
wherever	O
he	BE
wants	IP
he	C

but	O
he	O
does	O
not	O

to	O
be	O

he	BE
'll	IP
he	C
'll	C
just	O
bark	O

and	O
bark	O

no	O

he	O
's	O
uh	O
taken	O
to	O
the	O
training	O
pretty	O
well	O

and	O
uh	O
he	O
knows	O
where	O
our	O
yard	O
is	O

and	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
pretty	O
small	O
yard	O

but	O
he	O
seems	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
boundaries	O

and	O
he	O
usually	O
is	O
good	O
about	O
staying	O
within	O
them	O

although	O
our	O
next	O
door	O
neighbors	O
have	O
a	O
dog	O
too	O

and	O
uh	O
she	BE_IP
she	C
is	O
good	O
friends	O
with	O
my	O

and	O
so	O
he	O
often	O
gets	O
to	O
smelling	O
her	O
scent	O
and	O
will	O
go	O
over	O
there	O
to	O
sniff	O
around	O

but	O
he	O
's	O

he	O

out	O

uh	O
if	O
i	O

him	O
i	O
call	O
him	O

and	O
he	O

so	O
he	BE_IP
he	C

about	O

and	C
things	O

no	O

we	O

i	BE_IP
i	C

uh	O
this	O

this	BE_IP
this	C
