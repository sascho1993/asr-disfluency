switchboard_data/silver_transcript
	- utils/prepare_ms_words.sh:
		makes use of Kaldi code, e.g. to remove [silence], map acronyms, cut th-[em]
	- utils/get_a_b_swap2.py:
		compares sets of words of each conversation side (e.g. 2005A and 2005B)
	- utils/compare_silver_ms.py:
		read in switchboard_corrected_with_silver_reannotation.tsv and words (generated by prepare_ms_words.sh).
		map words that match: [ms_key, silver_key] ms_word, silver_word
		if silver is split into two lines (e.g. it 's), they are combined and put into one line
		problems encountered: MS-state contains additional content that was put in <<>> comments in Penn Treebank
				      differences due to the different guidelines are not apparent in silver: gonna, communercation, etc.
				      Some utterance files are cut short
