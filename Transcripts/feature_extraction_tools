spectral features + beat extraction (+ Audio Segmentation)

Not usable:
It has to be noted that the two tempo-related features are only extracted for whole audio recordings (they are not computed in a short-term basis). Therefore, they can only be added to long-term averages of the mid-term features described in the previous section. For segment-classifiers of general audio classes (e.g. music vs speech) tempo features are not applicable.
